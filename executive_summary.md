# 1. Project Scope and Objectives

## Primary Goals
- Develop an advanced model to analyze and classify posts with high accuracy, ensuring precise categorization even in closely related categories.
## Secondary Goals
- Assess morale and sentiment within 'usmc' and 'army' subreddit communities.
- Conduct comparative sentiment analysis in 'schizophrenic' vs 'bipolar' subreddits.
# 2. Key Findings

## Classification Accuracy
- The model achieved over 80% accuracy in classifying posts into the correct subreddit categories.
## Trends and Sentiments
- Word cloud analysis revealed similar word usage patterns in 'army' vs 'usmc' and 'schizophrenic' vs 'bipolar' subreddits. However, the model accurately categorized posts, suggesting its effectiveness in nuanced text analysis.
# 3. Methodology

## NLP Techniques and Models
- Employed various NLP techniques including:
    - TfidfVectorizer, 
    - LogisticRegression, 
    - MultinomialNB, 
    - RandomForestClassifier, 
    - GradientBoostingClassifier, 
    - GridSearchCV, 
    - Pipeline, 
    - WordCloud, 
    - TextBlob, 
    - and BertTokenizer.
# 4. Impact and Recommendations

## Potential Impacts
- The model's high accuracy in classification can aid stakeholders in monitoring community morale and sentiment, providing insights for interventions and support. It's applicable in various contexts, including HR and marketing, for sentiment analysis in online communities.
## Recommendations
- Opt for models trained on comprehensive datasets rather than focusing solely on frequently used words.
- For sentiment analysis, consider model consistency in output before drawing conclusions.
- Recognize that aggregated sentiments might not reflect the entire community's sentiment.
- Conduct analyses outside holiday seasons to avoid seasonal bias, especially in military and mental health contexts.
# 5. Target Audience

## Primary Audience
- Military leadership, mental health professionals, and stakeholders interested in community morale and sentiment analysis.
## Secondary Audience
- HR and marketing professionals seeking tools for community sentiment analysis.
# 6. Limitations and Future Work

## Limitations
- The study's timing during the holiday season may have skewed the sentiment analysis results.
- The anonymity of posts precludes verification of their authenticity.
- Aggregated sentiment analysis does not necessarily represent the overall sentiment of each community.
## Future Directions
- Repeat the analysis outside the holiday season to validate findings.
- Implement these models in organizational settings for real-time community sentiment tracking. This could aid in identifying trends affecting morale and efficiency, leading to more informed decision-making.
- Track the changes in the model performance from the initial analysis to the present day. This could reveal the model's effectiveness in adapting to changes in the communities' language patterns.
