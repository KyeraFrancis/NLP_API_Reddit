,Army,"So I got sent a 223 page PDF going over the results of my claims and med board in general for the first part of the process. I have 5 calendar days, which ends tomorrow, to dispute the results.

I don't think they expect soldiers to read that pdf considering it's so long. I have found probably near/over 100 inconsistencies after reading nearly every page at this point. Blatant fabrication, typos/lies depending on the page(more info can be provided if asked; I find it difficult to explain), and things that are just literally wrong. For example, a ROM test for my hips when I didn't claim hip problems, and no ROM test for my hips were done, because I didn't claim it. Because I don't have hip problems. But numbers for my hips are present somehow. For almost every finding they have. If I had to give it a percentage I'd throw around 70-80% of this PDF seems to have inconsistencies. There are findings I definitely agree with for sure however.

Do I fight this? How would I even start. Are there other routes other than my PEBLO if need be? I understand I have 1 year after I get out to rectify inconsistencies, but nearly the entire thing is inconsistent. Even down to them claiming I don't take medicine for my disqualifying condition. With documents supporting that I do. In the same pdf, and occasionally in the same page.

None of this is speculation. I can prove that something is very wrong in the pdf they provided me.

Is this a common occurrence with a board that you've heard where nearly everything is wrong and can easily be proven so? Am I overthinking this? I am willing and able to say I could potentially be misreading information, I'm not a doctor, but some of what I'm reading is legitimately wrong.

I don't want to underplay what I mean by inconsistencies either. Some of the documents for example say I don't take medicine for my disqualifying condition multiple times. But my medical records prove I am taking this medicine. That doesn't seem like a standard typo.

If examples of inconsistencies, either minor or not, want to be provided if asked I can do that in the comments below.

,Army,"I requested Germany as my next PCS, and it will most likely get approved since I added three more years to my contract just to get Germany. I choose Germany mainly because I want to travel throughout Europe while I am there and just see and experience that part of the world. However, how naive of me that I never considered racism as a potential issue as part of my research about Europe before I submitted my PCS request. Now that I have done quite some research in this regard, I feel like I have shot myself in the foot with this decision. And I don't think there is anything I can do to change it before the order comes down, which just makes it worse. 

Some background for the context. I am ethnically East Asian, 6' 185 lbs, and physically fit. I have never really experienced racism in the U.S. growing up. At least not straight to my face with racial slurs that kind of racism. However, based on my research, non-whites experience way more racism in Germany and in Europe in general than compared to North America (I traveled extensively in the U.S. and Canada). I mainly researched people's experiences in Germany and Europe on Reddit, Quora, and YouTube. The majority of the anecdotes that I have read mentioned being called racial slurs straight to their faces while walking on the street just minding their own business. Other incidents included being refused service at restaurants or other social services, one mentioned being spit on the foot while waiting for his train in Germany, and the difference in attitudes while interacting with locals. All these are from European-born racial minorities, expats, and tourists. When I narrowed the research down to ""How Asians are treated in Germany and other European countries?"" what came up the most was being called racial slurs straight to the face.

I understand racism is an issue that exists in every country. However, I am just shocked that it is seemingly so prevalent in Germany and other European countries. If a particular issue is brought up frequently enough (not by the locals but by foreigners in a country), that means it is a common enough occurrence that bothers people. 

I think my expectations for Europe were extremely high and looking into how non-whites are being treated shocked me as I have never experienced those kinds of racism here in the U.S. And I just don't want incidents like these to ruin my experience in Germany and Europe as I will certainly travel the continent before coming back home.

I want to see if anyone can provide some insights into your experience in Germany and traveling the European continent because I couldn't really find that many U.S. service members' experience on this particular issue. I genuinely want to know and learn so as to get myself into the right mindset and expectations before going to Germany. Please don't be nasty in this post.

,Army,"Hey yall. Michigan army national guard here. im looking for some advice on how to handle the dramatics in the military. Im positive its not just in the NG so anybodys advice would be greatly appreciated❤️.
A little background about me: I grew up an army brat. My mom retired as a cw 3 after 23 years of flying hawks for 160th (soar). She was big on teaching me about the army. She implemented army style teachings like dicipline and honor. Ive been getting dropped and smoked since i could do a push up lol. 
I know for me, living my life by army values is easy as its second nature by now. Like how people put faith into their religion, i put my faith into the army. I always thought it was a place to hone leadership skills, communication skills, teamwork skills, just generally become a better human. 
Recently, ive been struggling with the fact that the national guard is nothing like that. The general idea that complacency, gossip, and the general mistreatment of soldiers in my unit has been getting to me lately, and i feel like im losing my faith. Rumors spread like wildfire, and when ive brought the ones about me up to my leadership, ive been told to just ignore them. Usually, i can do it, but my last straw was when my new plt sgt told me he had heard things about me before even meeting me, and the rumors were about my sex life. Like i said, i can usually brush things off my shoulders, but when my personal life is outed, and thats what shapes my reputation, i really struggle to just ignore it. 
I used to love the military and everything it stood for and now i dont even want to apply myself. I hate going to drill. I feel like i cant trust anyone. I generally feel very alone when im around members of my unit and i feel like no one there will back me. Ldrship will just tell me to ignore everything and people will just keep gossiping.

There was no doubt he was the best Soldier in the formation. He routinely competed for every competition at every echelon he could, he was technically competent to boot, and had a great personality. This Soldier was a few totem poles below me in the CoC. I recognized him and his Soldiers often and his leadership threw everything they could their way (missions, training events, etc) - you know the old adage great work only gets you more work.    


I thought because this Soldier was performing so well, and in turn leading his Soldiers to perform well, while being recognized and afforded some good opportunities that he was enjoying his time in the formation. Man, that couldn’t have been further from the truth.    


 I never stopped to think about what this particular Soldier wanted or needed to continue being happy with his job/life and not get burned out. As a leader you understand the 80/20 rule but things just kind happen over time that you lose sight over the minutiae and it’s hard to act on things you don’t know (you don’t know what you don’t know).    


This is where this sub helped re-energize my lapse in effective leadership. As I was scrolling through one of the threads I saw a simple comment from a user about how his PSG was incompetent and how he was struggling to find motivation. In short he perceived other personnel were getting the sexier missions, deployments, and his leadership wasn’t helping him get to his NCOPD course he needed for promotion. I clicked on the profile and saw other similar comments. The uniqueness about my unit for things such as deployments and other descriptors gave me a hunch that “oh shit this is one of my guys, in fact it’s my best guy!”.    


I could’ve been an asshole about this or felt embarrassed my unit was anonymously being put on blast but those thoughts never crossed my mind. Instead I was humbled and disappointed that I wasn’t an effective enough leader to prevent this sort of thing. Things were going great for me, on the outside looking in my formation was the best, #1 etc. What a failure, I thought. So I PMd him.    


Without hesitation I sent him a note and apologized for not being aware of his issues and that I will personally make sure he gets to his school while doing everything in my power to get him on the next combat rotation (this could’ve been foolish if he wasn’t who I thought he was). Work came the next day and I called him in for a chat. He let loose about things occurring in his foxhole that I hadn’t even noticed.    


Not even a couple months later I had to remove his leadership for bad personal conduct. I changed out shortly after setting things in motion to make that Soldier’s life better. The Soldier got the deployment he wanted and was sent to school upon returning from deployment. After PCSing, him and his new leadership reached out with a simple thanks and that Soldier was, for a lack of better words,  “living his best life”. He was a little embarrassed that I found his Reddit profile. He only posted sporadically since then and not in this sub - I feel bad about that.    


I owe this simple good news story to this sub. There are much bigger good news stories as a result of this place but this is a personal one that’s near and dear to me because it’s shaped my outlook on the social media space for good.    


As an aside, awhile back I had an interview for a selective opportunity and they asked me “how do you get feedback that systems and processes in the Army are working”.

,Army,"Hi all, looking for some advice from other cyber individuals that could tell me whether or not now would be a good time for me to drop my packet or not for 170A
I am 6 years in the reserves as a SGT, 25U, and have SEC+ and finishing up my Masters In Cybersecurity and Information Assurance this march (which includes CEH). I am the senior Security administrator in my civilian job, where I have built physical firewalls from scratch, routing tables, traffic rules, logs, backups, etc. I also am responsible for developing the counties NIST policies, revising the IRPs, as well as other cybersecurity management requirements for local government.also, I am the security LASO for the local 911 operations. I have over 5 years of experience in the civilian side from a few areas in IT, and have a good aptitude to learn quickly.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, just looking for any golden nuggets of wisdom y’all want to share! Also, I’d be happy to have any advice on what branch offers the best family life.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army," 

Hello everyone, I am a bit struggling to make a decision on whether I should join the army as enlisted or officer. I am currently 23 years old and I just completed my mandatory military duty in South Korea in March 2023 (I have dual citizenship: Korea and the US). Now I am back in the United States and continuing my 3rd year of 5-year architecture program as an undergraduate student. During my academic, I had a strong passion for the US Army and I made a decision to walk the Army path(hopefully serve more than 20 years). I made two options and I am struggling to choose one. Please let me know what you guys think about each option.

1. Our campus has 2 year ROTC program. If I choose this, I'll go ROTC Leadership Training Camp at Fort Knox, Kentucky during the summer break and do the ROTC program in my 4th and 5th year of college. Once again, I want to serve in the army for at least 20 years and would it be difficult to maintain the officer position? I heard if you don't get promoted for a specific amount of time, you will have to leave the army.
2. After completing 3rd year of college, I'll join as a reserved soldier and complete my academic. Unfortunately, the architecture program does not provide online classes so I chose reserved rather than active duty. However, I am going to make an attempt to switch from reserved duty to active duty right after getting the degree. After serving as an enlisted soldier for 7\~8 years, I'll apply for OCS or green to gold to become an officer.

I think I am just overthinking it too of future stuff, but I want to make a firm decision very soon so that I can be confident about the choices that I make. My main goal is to become an officer in the future. What are your guys' thoughts?

,Army,"Keeping things vague. Our preschooler attended school on base. 

FAPM and CDC director called my spouse and I in for a meeting. Stated no one was hurt, but an urgent decision had to made that day. Okay. I tried to push up the meeting, they wouldn't meet even an hour earlier. 

FAPM started the meeting saying it was not to be recorded. Okay. We're not army, different branch here for a joint forces thing.

FAPM started by stating the above facts, but the person who did this was under the age of culpability. So good news, no crime has been committed! Therefore there's no police report. 

They would not tell us how these events were ""caught"" other than video existed of it. They would not turn over the video to CID when pressed. 

FAPM stated it might be a good idea to get a regular check up by the pediatrician on base, but no forensic interview or forensic physical was required because again (!) No crime has occurred. That it would likely be traumatic to our child. I said fuck that out loud, and that the base clinic would not be touching our kid. We switched to select during open enrollment anyway. 

FAPM &amp; CDC director explained the delay in notifying us was due to coming up with a safety plan: the truely responsible party was a piece of furniture that partially obscured the view of the teacher. It had been properly reprimanded by being moved. They also decided to move our son to the other side of the classroom. 

The ""exhibiting child"" was not removed from the CDC. The CDC director said they would still have some shared activities together. 

I asked how she could possibly say our son wasn't internally injured? We argued. 

FAPM didn't hand us a damn thing. I asked where are the papers? You're supposed to be handing us an entire folder right now. FAPM stated ""people would call us"". And that if no one called us in 24hrs, then to reach out directly to her, and she'd ""nudge them"".

She gave us no one to follow up with other than her, and also, didn't even give us her office # or card.

I said fuck that and drove our kid to closest children's hospital. A forensic exam revealed a lot more. 

We are unsure who's command we were under in our branch for this deployment. It took a considerable amount of time. we were busy addressing medical need. Our son is in fact injured internally. He's also clearly traumatized and freaking out. We're obviously out of childcare and drowning. Full blown crisis. 

I discovered;
-FAPM notified our command but did not tell them any details. Not our names or contact info, nor any details. Simply stated there was an instance of PBS involving a child of that branch/command. 
-did the same thing for our jag
-did the same thing for CID
-did the same thing for cps

Facts:
-CDC &amp; FAPM delayed notifying us by 30 hrs. So there were 3-4 (which is it?) events, a total of 78hrs prior first event. Maybe? They would not give exact dates, duration, or times. 
-dna is not really collectable beyond 24hrs for the kit. Technically possible at 72 hrs, but diminishing returns. 
-CDC didn't create an incident report form. We've hounded them. They will not provide one.
-FAPM did not notify garrison police
-CID argued with us for hours. Wouldn't take a report or statement from us, nor open an investigation into negligence on behalf of staff. Would not view or retain footage. 
-I sent an email to the garrison commander. Initially they called, sounded cooperative but hands off. Kept directing us back to FAPM and CID. Then they stopped responding. Straight to voicemail, everything goes unresponded. 


I finally tracked down each person FAPM notified. Verified in writing if protocol required 24hrs to notify, she waited 23hrs and 47 minutes. I forced a CID to open an investigation by notifying CPS through the Children's hospital. 

Good news, they found another impacted child. Bad news, we've been shut out of everything. 

They also went on the offensive. Garrison commander banned me from CDC property under punishment of 6 months in prison. CDC director is stating I threatened the staff. I most certainly did not. I went in and asked for the incident report. They told me no and to leave, I complied immediately although I was pissed. No threatening movements. GPS shows I was on base for all of 9 minutes. I also popped in to run an errand across the street, have proof.

Our child is making repeated statements of adult involvement. But he's also 4. I've read Miller vs. United States. His testimony would be ""unreliable"".

I have a 1 degree connection to the military desk at CNN. I put out feelers, there's a couple news outlets interested but only if our identity is revealed. Spouse would have to do it. 

Im realistic. I know we're not getting justice. I've read DoDI 6400.01, 608-18. If we go to media I can see the protocol requiring to kick it up outside the chain of command and automatically trigger a whole lot of scrutiny.

,Army,"Hi guys, I am 17f really wanting to join the army as a 68 Charlie. My parents are very much against me joining but I have wanted to join for two years already. I’ve began talking to a school recruiter to join and I got 73 on the asvab so I think there’s a high possibility I could get that job. I need to turn in some basic paperwork to see if it is even available and if so he could reserve it for me for when I go to meps. The problem is my parents won’t take me since I also need their signature and I want to join right after graduation and I feel the longer I wait, there is a least likely chance the job is available. I want it really bad and I just want the army experience badly. I know it’s going to be really hard but I’m willing to risk it.

My parents are very much against me joining but I have wanted to join for two years already. I’ve began talking to a school recruiter to join and I got 73 on the asvab so I think there’s a high possibility I could get that job. I need to turn in some basic paperwork to see if it is even available and if so he could reserve it for me for when I go to meps. The problem is my parents won’t take me since I also need their signature and I want to join right after graduation and I feel the longer I wait, there is a least likely chance the job is available. I want it really bad and I just want the army experience badly. I know it’s going to be really hard but I’m willing to risk it. I’ve already been working at my job for two years and attending high school at the same time I don’t like the experience. &lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"Dear SMA,

How to fix the army in a few easy steps:

1) get your head out of your butt

2) hire me. I'm currently working on my Master's to be a therapist, so I know how to listen. 

3) pay me $50k and send me around the country (and OCONUS) for a year. I'll go base to base in birkenstocks and shorts and take soldiers out for lunch—the normal guys. The terminal E4, the PFC struggling but *trying* to pass their H/W, the SSG whose brother died and yet the SSG can't go home for the funeral because leadership said so. Give me a budget of $40 x working day to buy these dudes lunch and hear what's going on in their life

4) I'll take detailed notes, and at the end of the year we will synthesize all the information and create a weekend/weeklong course for senior leadership. 

5) we take a number of groups of senior leadership through this course about how to deal with soldier issues in ""the new army"", starting with not denying emergency leave just because we need the soldier ""just in case""

,Army,"So I need some advice because no one in my unit really wants to help me with medical issues that I'm having. I've been diagnosed with chronic anxiety which just showed up out of nowhere before annual training last year and I knew there was nothing to be worried about but it still happened. I've turned in medical records for all of that. I also developed gastroesophical reflux disease (GERD) along with chronic IBS and chronic gastritis which causes me severe stomach pain especially when I'm stressed. My COC knows about all of this and it has been sent in writing along with documentation from doctors that is signed. I have a pending medical profile but I still have people (especially my PSG) saying that since I'm not technically on profile yet that nothing will happen to help me with this since they cannot cover their own a**es. The commander had previously agreed in November to let me RST because the chaos during a weekend at my unit stresses me TF out to the point that I'm in extreme physical pain and cannot sleep at night before and during. I know this seems quite extreme over a drill weekend and I don't understand myself why I'm having these issues but it is what it is I guess. Anyways, I get word 3 days ago that I had to be at drill this weekend from my PSG and it was per the 1SG so I had conflicting information (in my eyes) from the commander and 1SG. I reached out to the full-time staff because I had to go to my unit and get a new CAC as mine was about to expire so I didn't think anything of it and I went to S1 who is actually super helpful and asked about this. I was told to call back that afternoon after she had her meeting with the commander and I did when our S3 sergeant answered the phone and was an absolute smart a** and was like we will see you Saturday. Anyways, I then proceeded to get extremely stressed and got sick so I went to the doctor and got a medical excuse. I sent that in only to get crawled about ignoring COC and that I must fulfill my duties to the army reserves. I was told that I would be excused from drill but would not be able to make it up when I know of another person in my platoon that was allowed to RST this weekend. I'm kind of at a standstill right now because all of my medical conditions which are chronic are being ignored and I don't know how to get this situation handled. I can't go up the COC because my unit will not allow anyone to know how to get in contact with anyone above them in order to get things corrected. There was another soldier who had an injury during an FTX and filed two congressional complaints after the unit did not compensate him for his injury or get him medical care and still nothing was done to help him or compensate him in any way. The only reason I add that is because it just goes to show the unit has a track record for ignoring medical for soldiers.

I&amp;#39;ve been diagnosed with chronic anxiety which just showed up out of nowhere before annual training last year and I knew there was nothing to be worried about but it still happened. I&amp;#39;ve turned in medical records for all of that. I also developed gastroesophical reflux disease (GERD) along with chronic IBS and chronic gastritis which causes me severe stomach pain especially when I&amp;#39;m stressed. My COC knows about all of this and it has been sent in writing along with documentation from doctors that is signed. I have a pending medical profile but I still have people (especially my PSG) saying that since I&amp;#39;m not technically on profile yet that nothing will happen to help me with this since they cannot cover their own a&lt;strong&gt;es. The commander had previously agreed in November to let me RST because the chaos during a weekend at my unit stresses me TF out to the point that I&amp;#39;m in extreme physical pain and cannot sleep at night before and during. I know this seems quite extreme over a drill weekend and I don&amp;#39;t understand myself why I&amp;#39;m having these issues but it is what it is I guess.

,Army,"Hi all, 

I process these types of actions and for the first offense SM is to be flagged a U and is counseled- 2nd offense it states SM loses security clearance and begins adverse separation. 

how long does this flag stay on if Soldier doesn’t have a repeat offense? Will this stay on the Soldiers record permanently? (I have 2 Soldiers, both new E-4s)

Thanks

,USMC,"Does anyone else have weird dreams like this? 

I mean I don’t even smoke anymore, but I still have this dream every once in awhile where somehow I’m still active duty. Then I have to wake up and do everything all day like I’m still in, but it’s actually still me from after my EAS and I’d for sure piss hot and I know I’d be fucked. Which in turn gives me massive anxiety while sleeping until I actually wake up and realize it was just the same dream again.

Pissing hot was probably my one of my biggest fears while active, even though personally at the time I stayed as far away from anything even remotely related to it as possible, because I knew back then even being associated with anything of the sort was asking for trouble. So I never really had any “urges” while still active, nor did I even knowingly put myself into situations that would even come close to any of that. I think the fear came more from seeing others around me fail a piss test for whatever and getting booted out, which to me seemed like the easiest way to throw ones life away and that in itself was enough to make me steer clear of drugs for my entire enlistment.

I wouldn’t quantify it as a bad dream necessarily. I feel like I just don’t actually think of myself as a Marine any longer. I don’t even think I was ever that good of a Marine by any metric to begin with, maybe middle of the pack at best. More so as like a “everyone else chose to do this, and I chose to do that” or “they decided to do college, and I chose to enlist” so to speak. My 4 years of service was pretty much quite unremarkable in terms of “doing shit” (0 deployments , 1 MEU). Which really doesn’t bother me considering it was only 4 years out of my entire life of 28. I actually enjoyed being FAP’d out from my unit for six months working as OPFOR in a MOUT town outside of 62 area on Pendleton rather than I enjoyed my actual unit save for the MEU. 

Reddit and this sub are probably actually one of my last connections to the Corps in any sort of way anymore anyways, I guess you could say. 

Sometimes I think maybe it’s my subconscious trying to tell me something, or something of that sort. Maybe so? 

Anyways, I’ve been thinking about making this post for a while, but wasn’t sure how you all would feel or if anyone else ever has dreams like this as well.

&lt;p&gt;Pissing hot was probably my one of my biggest fears while active, even though personally at the time I stayed as far away from anything even remotely related to it as possible, because I knew back then even being associated with anything of the sort was asking for trouble. So I never really had any “urges” while still active, nor did I even knowingly put myself into situations that would even come close to any of that. I think the fear came more from seeing others around me fail a piss test for whatever and getting booted out, which to me seemed like the easiest way to throw ones life away and that in itself was enough to make me steer clear of drugs for my entire enlistment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t quantify it as a bad dream necessarily. I feel like I just don’t actually think of myself as a Marine any longer. I don’t even think I was ever that good of a Marine by any metric to begin with, maybe middle of the pack at best. More so as like a “everyone else chose to do this, and I chose to do that” or “they decided to do college, and I chose to enlist” so to speak. My 4 years of service was pretty much quite unremarkable in terms of “doing shit” (0 deployments , 1 MEU). Which really doesn’t bother me considering it was only 4 years out of my entire life of 28. I actually enjoyed being FAP’d out from my unit for six months working as OPFOR in a MOUT town outside of 62 area on Pendleton rather than I enjoyed my actual unit save for the MEU. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit and this sub are probably actually one of my last connections to the Corps in any sort of way anymore anyways, I guess you could say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think maybe it’s my subconscious trying to tell me something, or something of that sort. Maybe so? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I’ve been thinking about making this post for a while, but wasn’t sure how you all would feel or if anyone else ever has dreams like this as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share some weird dreams you still have or if you can relate in the comments if you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

I would of course like to first state that I'm only a civilian, who's closest experience to anything Marine Corps is MCJROTC (go ahead and make all the jokes you want).

With that out the way, I would like to hear about your folks experience when it comes to equipment loadouts when it comes to field exercises..etc. 

For starters, I've seen images with Infantry with M40 Gas Mask carriers in the field (outside of desert storm). I presume that was likely a required piece of equipment, but did any of you ever sham your way out of bringing it along? 

What about GeDunk and Pogey bait? Was it common to bring some some along, and if so what did you bring? 

How did you set up and utilize your Alice webbing and pack? Did you have dump pouches for empty rifle magazines? What did you bring along in your Buttpack if you used one? 

What about personnel hygiene dealing with personal hygiene in the field? As it wasn't till the 1980s that baby wipes really became widespread. Did you or anyone bring baby wipes along into the field with you?

The reasons for this is because:

I’ve had back pain since MCT, for a short summary, before I joined the military I was diagnosed with scoliosis. Doctors said it developed as I got older, at the time they said it was a mild curve. I enlisted in the military after spending a year in the DEP, MEPS noted the spine but went “eh” and still passed me through. Went to bootcamp a year later in January of 2023 when I was of age, suffered during the hikes because of my back but pushed through it since the whole “if you go the medical we will drop you”, went to MCT in May, during the final hike I felt something just immediately hurt on my ride side and lasted over 2 months during the schoolhouse. Over time it went from hella hurting to mangeable. I hit the fleet in September, because my regiment was moving around units and that I had a gym injury that lasted 3-ish weeks I never rucked anywhere so it allowed my back to not get that bad like during the summer. Fast forward to Christmas leave, I’m messing around with my friends and injure my back to the point where it felt like back in May - absolutely painful. I took pain killers (spare Motrin from a gym injury in September) to no avail. I get back this Tuesday at 2AM, yesterday I get off at like 12 since half the units on leave still. Writhing in pain still so I go to my personal trainer after work - they’re closed. I go to medical - we have an appointment for you on the 11th. Then today, I get a call from my lieutenant he asks if I’m light duty, and I tell him no but- “hey we’re short a RO so you’re going to itx in a week, you’ll be there for 5 weeks to 10 weeks”. I told him I’ve been trying to see the naval doctor here to see my back and the personal trainer since it’s been hurting horribly. He asks if I have paperwork, and I say I’m going to medical to get it. Medical refers me to PT, the PT says my spine looks absolutely curved. Like, severe was her words under her breath before she corrected herself so I wouldn’t panic or whatever. She does the whole evaluation, everything hurts and she notes it and says I need to set an appointment with an MO. I go back to medical, they say I can go to sick call tomorrow morning at 8:30 and they’ll move the appointment to… the 10th.  So I don’t know what’ll happen if I get light duty, but my Cpl later today tells me that “command decides, even if you get light duty medical has no say around here, command does”.

,bipolar,"Hi all,

I, (NB 27), have been anti-meds since I was diagnosed with depression after a psychotic outbreak, 5 years ago. I was put on anti-psychotics (terrain) and anti-depressants (citalopram) which I believe started my first manic episode : it lasted two months. During those two months I suddenly became a sex worker, had unprotected sex, gave a lot of the money I earned away, had a nose job, etc... it just changed my life forever, not really for the best.

After that it's just been ups and downs. I was diagnosed bipolar 3 years ago but never took meds, other than I've actually managed to make it not so horrendous with therapy (psychoanalysis twice a week) and a strict routine. But I have no life, no life at all, I just do nothing and talk to almost no-one. I'm not stable at all. When I feel stable enough I can write a few lines, but I'm stable for two weeks every three months. And those are the best two weeks !

I'm crashing down from a manic episode at the moment. I'm trying to find the will to book an appointment with a psychiatrist. But I'm worried I won't be able to write at all, and I'm worried I won't be myself, and I'm just traumatized by being put on the wrong meds when I was in my early twenties. Now in my late twenties and I feel like my life is fucked.

So, I just wanted your HONEST opinion on meds. What did it change for you ?

,bipolar,"So, I've already talked about my recent relationship in other posts, but I often overthink about it so I'll just try again.

I(f26) was with this guy (m30) for around a year and a half. I suffer from bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, I started being treated for these at the beginning of our relationship, helped also by him cause I had recently attempted at my own life. So he was a bit my knight on a white horse, till six/seven months after.

We entered a bit a crisis moment cause he was unsure about being able of being in a relationship. I was in the meantime entering a depressive phase. One night I asked him to meet cause I was in a very bad phase, having s\*icidal ideation and stuff like that. I went there and found him crazy drunk and high. We entered a huge fight cause he was a real asshole, at some point while I was talking he was just scrolling on Instagram so I took his phone out of frustration and threw it on the bed. He started acting as if I had attacked him, he told me he would never talk to me again cause he's against any sort of violence, I was crying and feeling guilty like crazy, and when after like one hour he seemed calmer jokingly touched him or something. He took me from my wrists and pushed me to the ground, where he kept me forcing me. I could see he wanted to punch me and I told him ""Are you gonna hit me?"" to make him think, and he took a step back. When we went to sleep I had to take my sleeping medication, I was taking it with the lights off. He abruptly turned on the lights, grabbed me and my stuff and threw me out of the house, then he threw the medication at me and told me ""now go and kill yourself"". I did that, it was 4am and I was emotionally dead.  
He barely ever said he was sorry after, we didn't talk for three weeks during which he told shared friends that he wanted to punch me but he didn't do it cause he's an immigrant. He didn't check on me, not even when our friend told him I was in the hospital.

I got back with him. This happened in February, but we officially broke up around a month ago, like no contact and all. I'm not gonna get into the break up cause I don't even care analyzing that now, but very very similar circumstances.

Here's the thing: because of my mental health condition I'm a heavy burden to carry and this makes me justify him. I feel like if I wasn't crazy maybe he wouldn't have done what he's done that night, or he wouldn't have had some of the behaviors he's had in our relationship, many of which he showed that night and that's why it haunts me. First cause it was a very bad night I didn't give myself the time to think about and I just got back with him cause I loved him so much. Secondly cause that night he wasn't someone I didn't know, he was himself, maybe just an angrier version but still him.

So I'm confused. I feel like it was an abusive relationship, if anybody told me I'd be like ""gtfa from that asshole"". On the other hand though I feel like for real maybe I'm too difficult. I try to rely the least possible on people when it comes to my conditions, but I bet I don't succeed 100%. So maybe it is a bit on me.

,bipolar,"I’ve been on lamictal for at least 6ish weeks, I’m on 150 mg right now. I didn’t feel much of a difference, a good difference at least, until I got to 100 mg. 

I don’t know what happened, it used to put me to sleep. I remember when I first started taking it, it knocked me out. I was told it might make me sleepy, try taking it at night. It knocked me *out* and it was kind of nice. 20-30 minutes after taking it, I knew I’d fall asleep, stay asleep, and it did that for a while. 

After 150 mg, my sleep schedule is completely fucked. Nothing has changed, I’m still on a closing schedule, so I get home at about 11:30. Eat, take lamictal, and go to bed. I should be asleep by 1 AM, at the latest. 

It’s just gotten later and later. 1 AM turns into 2 AM. Then 3 AM. I used to naturally wake up at 8-9 AM. Now I can’t even wake up then with an alarm. I can’t get to sleep, I just lie there and toss and turn. I feel awful when I wake up. It’s like I barely even slept. I’m drowsy, sluggish, and I feel even worse because I slept through a quarter of my day. 

I haven’t had a serious “low” in a while. There was a smidge, a *smidge* of a low when I was just starting the med. I figured it was just my body adjusting to taking it, it went away pretty quickly. It was nothing compared to what I had dealt with before. 

I shouldn’t say I don’t know what got into me today, I know it’s probably because I haven’t slept decently in a hot minute. I couldn’t sleep last night. I woke up late, feeling like crap. I felt a little off, a little low, but nothing crazy. Later in the day, it hit me. I was talking to my husband, he was asking me what was wrong, it just set me off. 

I had started preparing for when I would need to get ready for work. I stopped in the middle of it and just laid down. I never lay down like that before getting ready for work. He knew something was off and kept asking what it was. He doesn’t fully understand that a lot of the time, it just happens. Nothing made me sad. Nothing made me upset. Nothing made me feel low. It just happened. 

I cried. I mean, if you saw how I cried, you would have thought someone *died.* I couldn’t stop either. He got upset because he can’t help me. He doesn’t understand why I’m upset. He doesn’t know what to do. I had to get ready for work, so he left and went to his friend’s house, upset. I got ready for work, frustrated. I can’t make him understand this, this is just how it is. It hasn’t happened in a while, that sudden drop in my mood. Even now, possibly having bipolar (I haven’t been diagnosed yet), having a name for what it could be, he still doesn’t get it. 

I’m just frustrated. I felt like shit before and now I feel worse because he doesn’t understand it or he thinks it’s something he’s done. He thinks there’s something he isn’t doing, or something he could be doing to make it all better. That just isn’t how it works.

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what happened, it used to put me to sleep. I remember when I first started taking it, it knocked me out. I was told it might make me sleepy, try taking it at night. It knocked me &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; and it was kind of nice. 20-30 minutes after taking it, I knew I’d fall asleep, stay asleep, and it did that for a while. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 150 mg, my sleep schedule is completely fucked. Nothing has changed, I’m still on a closing schedule, so I get home at about 11:30. Eat, take lamictal, and go to bed. I should be asleep by 1 AM, at the latest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just gotten later and later. 1 AM turns into 2 AM. Then 3 AM. I used to naturally wake up at 8-9 AM. Now I can’t even wake up then with an alarm.

When I was using, my depressive episodes never lasted long and were not intense. Just feelings of ""im not good enough"" but i was able to get through my day without being emotionally distraught. 

I have used daily for about 4-5 years and decided to get sober by going cold turkey. i am on no medications and i do not drink alcohol whatsoever because alcohol also exacerbates my symptoms.

I have been looking for studies on quitting cannabis while dealing with BPD but everything relays back to ""cannabis causes BPD"" or ""cannabis makes symptoms worse"". But more than 95% of these studies do claim there still isn't enough evidence. My theory is that they stopped using and reported what they are felt when not using.

,bipolar,"Hey guys,

I hope this message finds you all in good spirits. I'm turning to this group today to share a challenging situation I've encountered and seek some understanding and guidance from those who may have faced similar experiences. I attended a target school for JPMorgan Chase and was majoring in Statistics for two years until my gap year. My passion lies in data science, risk mitigation, and financial analysis, and I had set my sights on a Risk Management internship at JPMC.

Here's where things took an unexpected turn: I applied for the internship in February 2023 and was thrilled to be invited to a SuperDay in March 2023, which would have involved a trip to Plano, Texas for in-person interviews. However, my plans took a detour as I had to take a gap year due to being diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, which went undiagnosed for some time. Unfortunately, I had to spend three months in the hospital during this period.

The challenge arose when I found myself unable to communicate with recruiters, anyone from JPMC, or even my school, Cornell, for several months. In the midst of my health struggles, I missed the deadline to RSVP for the SuperDay. The shame I felt because of the nature of my situation made it difficult for me to explain to the recruiter why I couldn't get back to her on time.

I'm now at a crossroads, and I'm uncertain about my chances of working with JPMorgan in the future. I'm wondering if there's any hope of potentially interning or working for the company after missing such a crucial opportunity. Moreover, should I rethink my career path, or is there still a chance for me in the field of risk management at JPMC?

I'm reaching out to this community for advice, understanding, and perhaps experiences from those who have navigated similar challenges. How have you managed career setbacks due to bipolar disorder, and what steps did you take to move forward?

&lt;p&gt;I hope this message finds you all in good spirits. I&amp;#39;m turning to this group today to share a challenging situation I&amp;#39;ve encountered and seek some understanding and guidance from those who may have faced similar experiences. I attended a target school for JPMorgan Chase and was majoring in Statistics for two years until my gap year. My passion lies in data science, risk mitigation, and financial analysis, and I had set my sights on a Risk Management internship at JPMC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s where things took an unexpected turn: I applied for the internship in February 2023 and was thrilled to be invited to a SuperDay in March 2023, which would have involved a trip to Plano, Texas for in-person interviews. However, my plans took a detour as I had to take a gap year due to being diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, which went undiagnosed for some time. Unfortunately, I had to spend three months in the hospital during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge arose when I found myself unable to communicate with recruiters, anyone from JPMC, or even my school, Cornell, for several months. In the midst of my health struggles, I missed the deadline to RSVP for the SuperDay. The shame I felt because of the nature of my situation made it difficult for me to explain to the recruiter why I couldn&amp;#39;t get back to her on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now at a crossroads, and I&amp;#39;m uncertain about my chances of working with JPMorgan in the future. I&amp;#39;m wondering if there&amp;#39;s any hope of potentially interning or working for the company after missing such a crucial opportunity. Moreover, should I rethink my career path, or is there still a chance for me in the field of risk management at JPMC?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m reaching out to this community for advice, understanding, and perhaps experiences from those who have navigated similar challenges. How have you managed career setbacks due to bipolar disorder, and what steps did you take to move forward? Should I consider reaching out to the recruiter and explaining my situation in detail, or would it be wiser to focus on alternative opportunities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely appreciate any insights, empathy, or words of support you may have to offer. Thank you for taking the time to read my story and share your thoughts&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"I went through a manic episode in August of 2023, and then spiraled through depression afterwards. I ended up in a psych ward and then seeing a therapist afterwards. I started actually getting better around November up til now, but sometimes I wonder why this ever happened to me. I had a small manic or hypomanic episode around 2 years ago, but it didn't affect as much things in my life as my most recent episode. I lost friends and even had to move schools because I didn't have anyone left or any genuine friendships left, and that thought and a bunch of other thoughts just irked me so much. I lost the trust of my parents and ended up disappointing them and my sister. Basically being a burden to everyone around me, but not being able to stop my depressive habits. Although I am better now and have found new friends, sometimes I wonder why this had to happen to me in the first place. Though it obviously wasn't perfect, I was pretty content with my life back then. I had good friends and had adapted well in school, and I had a good relationship with my family.

I ended up in a psych ward and then seeing a therapist afterwards. I started actually getting better around November up til now, but sometimes I wonder why this ever happened to me. I had a small manic or hypomanic episode around 2 years ago, but it didn&amp;#39;t affect as much things in my life as my most recent episode. I lost friends and even had to move schools because I didn&amp;#39;t have anyone left or any genuine friendships left, and that thought and a bunch of other thoughts just irked me so much. I lost the trust of my parents and ended up disappointing them and my sister. Basically being a burden to everyone around me, but not being able to stop my depressive habits. Although I am better now and have found new friends, sometimes I wonder why this had to happen to me in the first place. Though it obviously wasn&amp;#39;t perfect, I was pretty content with my life back then. I had good friends and had adapted well in school, and I had a good relationship with my family. But during my episode I assumed I wanted more than that, and it went out of control.

,bipolar,"Soooo.. my birthday is in a few days. I just missed new years, due to my mental health and don’t want to miss my birthday for the same reason. 

Basically, I took decongestant for 3 days (didn’t know it could send you into mania) and well.. IT DID! And man! I was manic!

I took time off work (with my doctor’s approval) and everyone agreed it was best for me. (Including my boss) -they saw the mania, as it happened at work primarily-

My doctor has put me on a very high dose of my antipsychotics, leading me to go stagnant and not feeling emotions. ( I know this to be true, because I was on 15mg and felt nothing-emotion wise- the dose I’m going on now is 20mg.) 

So I’m worried of two things. 

1. If I throw this “party” with my close friends; and my boss finds out, does that look bad? Even though I’d be going back to work 2 days later. (I was never meant to work the week of the party anyway). 

2. Does it just sound like an awful idea anyway or a good one? 
Being with friends and loved ones = good?
Having to fake be a functional human when I feel dead and empty inside = bad?

,bipolar,"So... I'm basically a recurring character on ""House, M.D."" Weird shit happens to me all the goddamn time, that leaves medical personnel baffled. I am *extremely fortunate* to have a good handful of unrelated providers and specialists who, 1) believe me; and 2) are committed to coordinating care at whatever level they are able, to try and get some of this shit actually figured out right now. 

Like...when some folks at the ER were like, ""Hey, something weird is up, ask your primary care provider about autoimmune. We don't have the stuff to diagnose it here, but you're right, there's something up. Don't let them talk you out of it. Don't let anyone tell you you're crazy,"" I was like, ""...Well goddamn."" And my PCP immediately went, ""Okay. Here are the tests I have to run first before insurance will approve autoimmune testing,"" and I was like, ""...Well goddamn."" 

And along the way over the past, ohhhh, year and a half? Maybe more? My four medical besties have swapped lab results, and kept up with my cross-updates and gone, ""Oh hey, you might want to ask [other specialist] about this thing I'm seeing, it's not my specialty, but that might be of interest to them. Just see what they say, and let me know."" It's been pretty fucking great, for the U.S.

It looks like we're closing in on at least one diagnosis for some major issues. Unfortunately, it's one of them ""Dr. House"" diagnoses, and the lithium is probably a major factor. 🙃

I've been on it for a number of years, and I honestly feel like it's made a positive difference, mood-wise. But I'm tapering off, at direction of my PCP and psychiatric prescriber, and I've noticed a difference in physical symptoms already, after a short period of time. And they're trying to re-wrangle some other prescriptions to narrow the number of things I'm taking; the fact that I'm on blood pressure meds now means there's a combo pill that addresses ADHD, sleep, *and* blood pressure, so we're hoping to get a 4-in-1 for a nighttime situation in my pill organizer. 

But I've had to make the adjustments pretty quickly, to keep my physical health, and... I feel like trash. I can't see an endocrinologist until fucking March, to actually get my hormones checked, which would include the balance on my testosterone, which I recently started taking. My sleep has taken a nosedive, among other issues, and my mood is all over the place. Not to the extremes that it used to go, but I'm seeing old symptoms and indicators creep back that haven't reared their heads in over a decade, and I just don't want to go through this. Even though I know I'm much more capable. 

I'm between jobs right now, and I was bringing in like 85% of our income. We're headed for a divorce. We have a kid to take care of. He just qualified for fucking Medicaid. We're not financially desperate, but ""okay"" won't last forever. I'm looking for a job and dreading going back into the workforce, but I gotta be able to take care of myself and my kid, at least. I picked up a really good little short-term professional gig, and now I'm wondering if I can even do that. I feel like fucking trash, mentally and physically. 

I'm exhausted and starving 24/7; I can barely pull two thoughts together. I feel like I'm riding bite-sized rapid cycles, even though the highs aren't as high and the lows aren't as low, mood-wise. I'll wake up feeling ass-dragging tired and start trudging around, cleaning everything while I talk to my kid and get him ready, because I can't sit down and stay still. And then three or four hours later, BLAMMO! Attack of the three-hour nap, and I wake up sad and introspective and I can't shake it, and I don't even want to do the things that I like doing. And then I get some motivation to do them, and I get a bunch of ideas, and I get sucked into them a little bit, and then BLAMMO! Holy shit, get me to a bed, thank fuck it's bedtime...

How am I supposed to get a job like this? How am I supposed to KEEP a job like this? How am I supposed to complete a project? And I know it's not forever, but like...

About a week in, I was sitting in therapy, chatting away and very suddenly, I heard the clock ticking on the wall. I've been seeing the same therapist for four years and never once heard the clock. I stopped mid-sentence and just listened for a moment. I could hear the clock, the AC unit, the hawks bickering on the roof of the office, the cars outside. All of it. And hearing it didn't make me want to rip my hair out.

I burst into tears. Scared my poor therapist and explained to her what was happening and she just got this sweet, motherly look on her face. Guys, my head hasn't been quiet in years. It's always so loud. We refer to my episodes as ""the squirrel"" (think Twitchy from Hoodwinked or Foamy the Squirrel), based on a conversation we had when I was newly diagnosed and she was trying to explain what was happening to me by referring to it as ""the meth-ed out squirrel that lives in your head and sometimes does bizarre shit"". When I'm doing ok, I can still hear the damn thing knocking on the back door in my head, just waiting for me to get complacent. It's stressful. Anxiety-inducing.

My psychiatrist keeps telling me it'll pass and to just give myself some grace, demanding I do three self care activities every day (which I'm actually able to do, holy crap).

About me: I'm 24 y/o, diagnosed with bipolar 1, borderline personality disorder , major depression, social anxiety and some ""unspecific eating disorder"". Living with my fiance and working in my job regularly.

TW mention of specific medications:
Currently on:
Cymbalta                    90mg          1-0-0
Lithium                      450mg      0,5-0-1

Looking at my life, I'm somewhat stable. The problem is my meds kinda make me feel nothing. I still sometimes get my episodes, but therapy and meds keep them under control. What really bugs me is that big feeling of just nothing. How am I supposed to deal with ""nothing"". Nothing is fun, nothing is exciting, nothing is bad but not in a ""I don't want to live"" way, just in a.... big empty way.

Reducing my meds always resulted in big episodes with major problems (sh, losing friends etc) so my psych &amp; I agreed to keep my current medication like it is &amp; try reducing it sometime later. This really frustrates me.

The questions I can't find answers for: how am I supposed to live ""happy"" like this? Will this be my life forever? Is this feeling like being ""normal'? How do others deal with the big ""nothingness""? Is being totally insane and driven by bipolar episodes the only alternative?

,bipolar,"Bipolar is weird, sometimes you cry waterfalls literally all the time, sometimes you can't ever remember feeling sad. Sometimes you can't stop talking and sometimes you don't get out of bed for two months and can't even face another human, let alone talk to one.
Sometimes you spend loads of money online, run 10k then clean your whole apartment in the middle of the night; while reading two books, doing an online course and speaking to 4 friends at once. Then sometimes you dramatically and suddenly run out of energy, positivity and the will to live and you legit cry for 20 minutes on the kitchen floor because you ran out of washing powder and can't even do that right. You regularly entertain the fleeting thought, for just a moment, that you should give up and end it all over minor disruptions and conflict. You've probably tried to end it all at least once.
Music gives you goosebumps, the views on a hike make you cry. Other peoples pain makes your soul hurt while disapproval from others leaves you physically ill and broken up inside. Sex with you is intense and frequent, other people can't keep up. Your heart wants to burst when you see someone that you love and you have friends coming out of your ears because you overshare and people find you exciting when you're manic.

You're never sure what the right choice is, you struggle with boundaries. You live in fear of psychosis, of depression, of mania. Waiting irritates you, boring people irritate you, routine irritates you, rudeness irritates you. You have periods of intense activity and suddenly periods of sleeping .All. The. Time. 
The whole time this is going on some people run away from your behaviour some people just avoid the whole diagnosis not many people understand it. You dont understand it. Everybody has their opinion on why you are like you are, what you should do about it and when you should do it. Or they patronise your disease as if it is a recurring cold that might pop up from time to time; not a daily struggle against a severe strain of influenza of the mind, behaviour and personality. You have to talk to people that you don't know a million times over about what's in your head, if you're even lucky enough to get counselling, and everybody in your life knows how weird you are because they've probably all seen you do some odd shit or be totally broken at some point in your life. You can't work full time even though you want to because you can't regulate yourself long enough to get anywhere with a career, a relationship, a hobby. You're on a constant hike of ups and downs that come out of nowhere.
Sometimes you get these weird five minutes, usually when you're tired, where you feel like you might not even exist and nothing is real and you dont know if you're crazy or not and it unsettles you for ages.
Then some days you feel like you made it all up and there's absoloutly nothing wrong with you at all and never has been.

You've probably been hospitalised at some point and felt how it feels to very publicly lose your dignity, your independence, your freedom and your mind. You want to give up sometimes but you don't, you won't, or maybe you have and it didn't work. 
Sometimes you hate this irrational disease of disregulation and sometimes you embrace the terror and unpredictability because of the pure beauty and magic it makes you feel in your soul, like a secret that only a few others are in on.

Ok, so, I imagine other people have had their therapist think things are worse off than you think things are. How accurate do you find that is? Mine thinks things are definitely better than last year, but is still pretty concerned. IDK if that comes from a lot of concern of last year being repeated because of some similar triggers (it was \*really\* bad and I'm sure put strain on her too) or because of what's actually going on right now. To the point of suggesting I re-visit the idea of ECT with my psych nurse. Meanwhile I feel like things aren't great and I'd like them to be better, but they aren't out of control or worth major disruption of my life for.

,bipolar,"When I saw my psychiatrist in November, she upped my Lamtical to 300mg. She told me then that she wanted to put me back on another SSRI, but from where the Prozac literally almost turned my brain to total mush, and she was about to take an extended vacation, she didn't want to risk me needing something from her, and me having to deal with a different psych. The irony of the last part of that statement is that I found out from my therapist during my last session was that my psych is leaving the practice soon so I'm getting a new psych either way. On top of that, I'm also losing my therapist at the end of this month, which is *fantastic* because that means I get to rehash my whole life story all over again to two complete strangers. 

The indifferent feelings started last week. I originally chalked it up to my depressive episode at the time, but as the week went on and I became manic, I knew that, that wasn't the cause. The only way I can describe the feeling is like I'm burnt out with portions of my life; like some things have grown monotonous even though they're not. At the same time, I also catching myself running on autopilot, disassociating with myself, feeling like I'm not making any sense when I'm talking, and just feeling all out of sorts. I just feel kinda numb to the things around me, even though I don't want to feel that way. Honestly, because of these feelings, I've had a few drinks in the last week. I know it's not a good idea with my medication, but I just want to *feel something*, and I haven't been doing it in excess; it's just a drink or two every few nights. 

I don't understand why it started either. Things in my life has been going great. I got engaged on Christmas, my baby is hitting milestones what seems like every single day, I may be up for a promotion at my job; things that should be making me ecstatic seem like they're mundane and honestly, it upsets me in a way. I don't want to be like this because I don't want it affecting the things around me, and it makes me feel like a failure as a mother, as a partner, and as a human being. It also worries me because honestly, this could be a sign that I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown and I just don't truly realize it. If that happens then I really don't know how I'm going to handle it because it could ruin absolutely everything that I have going for me currently. 

My next appointment with my psych is in February, and honestly, if I still feel like this then, I doubt she'll be much help to me; especially since she's pushing for that SSRI despite me telling her no multiple times after the Prozac incident; honestly, I was telling her no before that, but she basically made it seem like that it was that, or I'd just have to deal with upping the Lamictal. I'd call my psych's office to see if they could let me talk to someone else, but my health insurance is currently in limbo. I asked my dad to drop me off of his because I started receiving Medicaid while I was pregnant, and my Medicaid won't approve any treatments or prescriptions currently because they're claiming I'm still covered through my dad's insurance, even though my dad's insurance says I'm not. Up until the 1st, my dad's insurance was my primary, so everything had to be run through them first before Medicaid would pick up the rest; hence why they're not approving anything because my healthcare providers are trying to bill everything solely to my Medicaid now. 

I'm just dealing with it for now I guess. Hopefully I'll get the insurance thing worked out within the next week, and if I don't, then I have no idea what I'll do. I have a therapy appointment on the 22nd, so maybe I can talk to her and see if she has any recommendations on how to deal with this; that is, if it's still a problem by that point.

,bipolar,"“Look at the bright side,” is something my mother always said to me. Its something I say to others and they often get upset like I’m invalidating their feelings but this approach works for me.

I recently read “Owning Bipolar,” by Michael Pipich and Joseph Shrand. In the book he describes mania/hypomania as the brain’s tool for pulling ourselves out of depression. It really made sense to me as my strongest hypomanic episodes have all come following the lowest lows.

After reading this, my eternal optimism made a little more sense to me. Whenever something negative happens I try to find the positives to keep me from falling into a low.

My girlfriend hates when I try to look at the bright side for her problems. But, when something happens I could be upset at her about, she loves how quickly I can get over it by seeing the good and empathizing with her remorse. She feels so loved and returns that love in amazing ways.

I’m not always good at seeing the bright side of my own day-to-day struggles, but this one is making me feel good today.

,bipolar,"I have been diagnosed with Bipolar II for around a year now, but have been struggling with increasingly worsening symptoms since I started high school (I’m currently getting my Master’s, so it’s been for a while). I struggle a lot with med-compliance, and I was off my bipolar medication at the end of last year. I had what I believe to be my first true manic episode with psychotic symptoms on the last day of the previous year. I believed the CIA was after me, thought that birds were drones for the government, that car license plates were codes that would help keep them from capturing me, etc. etc. Fortunately, I didn’t do anything embarrassing or damaging, since part of the delusion was the knowledge that if I let anyone know what I was thinking, that they would check me into a mental hospital and I would no longer know that the CIA was after me, which is exactly what they wanted (I, of course, fully believed that the thoughts I was having were real). It was very obvious to the people around me that something was wrong, but nobody knew what is was until I told them what had happened afterwards. 

I mention the date this happened because that’s was the last day of my health insurance, which is what made me hesitate to go to the psych ward (that, and the horror stories I’ve heard). I had asked my boyfriend and roommate if they believed I should spend some time in the ward, since I was terrified of this happening again, but they also didn’t seem to know what to do (which makes sense - I don’t think either of them had ever expected this to happen). I did go back on my medication and am still currently on it, but it’s a new medication and I’m on a really low dose of it, so I felt like there was a chance it wouldn’t do too much. I didn’t end up going to the psych ward, and now I’m worried it was the wrong decision. 

So I guess my question is - I have a psych appointment in about two weeks, and I was unsure if I should reschedule it to sometime sooner so that I can talk to my psych about all of this, especially since it’s been on my mind constantly since it’s happened. Also, if something like this were to happen again, should I go to a psych ward?

But I am experiencing psychosis like hearing things thinking people are watching the whole bam its very stressful. I can tell when I am out of it that is silly and not true but when I am in an episode its impossible to tell me otherwise.

,schizophrenia,"My mom really doesn't understand anything when I try to talk to her.  
She recently got herself a new boyfriend, and every plan she makes including him is never pleasant

One time, she invited me out to go on a drive and look at Christmas lights, and she asks if I wanted to go out to eat. I say no, but by the time she gets to my house she says ""I should have asked you first, BF (and his 7 year old kid) are joining us and they want to go out to eat."" I don't do good in restaurants I'm not familiar with, as I end up feeling watched and I don't trust the food.

New Year's Day, she invites me over -- won't let me go home because she had BF &amp; kid staying for the night, and I was panicking because she never told me ahead of time. 

Just yesterday, same thing with the restaurant. Gagged after being pressured into eating food, had a nervous shutdown, and no matter how many times this happens, my mom doesn't understand. I've tried talking to her, but all I get in response is ""nobody poisoned your food, nobody's looking at you, it's okay."" 

My dad left the country recently (for work) and I've had to stay with her. She limited the number of times I can say no to plans as a ""boundary."" I really can't tell if I'm overreacting, but every time I try to explain this stuff to her, she doesn't want to listen, or she tries making me explain it around other people. 

She only shit talks my dad around her boyfriend, and it's really irritating to listen to. My dad has OCD and autism and he's the only person I feel really understands me, as a lot of our symptoms overlap. 

I've tried talking to a friend, but of course, they ended up being the ""competitive about mental health/self diagnosed everything"" type. I seriously can't go a week without hearing, ""I get paranoid, too!"" or some shit like that. This person only got ""paranoid"" and started ""hallucinating"" after I decided to vent about my problems. As much as I genuinely dislike this person, they're one of the only people I have at this point.

She recently got herself a new boyfriend, and every plan she makes including him is never pleasant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One time, she invited me out to go on a drive and look at Christmas lights, and she asks if I wanted to go out to eat. I say no, but by the time she gets to my house she says &amp;quot;I should have asked you first, BF (and his 7 year old kid) are joining us and they want to go out to eat.&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t do good in restaurants I&amp;#39;m not familiar with, as I end up feeling watched and I don&amp;#39;t trust the food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Year&amp;#39;s Day, she invites me over -- won&amp;#39;t let me go home because she had BF &amp;amp; kid staying for the night, and I was panicking because she never told me ahead of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday, same thing with the restaurant. Gagged after being pressured into eating food, had a nervous shutdown, and no matter how many times this happens, my mom doesn&amp;#39;t understand. I&amp;#39;ve tried talking to her, but all I get in response is &amp;quot;nobody poisoned your food, nobody&amp;#39;s looking at you, it&amp;#39;s okay.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad left the country recently (for work) and I&amp;#39;ve had to stay with her. She limited the number of times I can say no to plans as a &amp;quot;boundary.&amp;quot; I really can&amp;#39;t tell if I&amp;#39;m overreacting, but every time I try to explain this stuff to her, she doesn&amp;#39;t want to listen, or she tries making me explain it around other people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She only shit talks my dad around her boyfriend, and it&amp;#39;s really irritating to listen to. My dad has OCD and autism and he&amp;#39;s the only person I feel really understands me, as a lot of our symptoms overlap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried talking to a friend, but of course, they ended up being the &amp;quot;competitive about mental health/self diagnosed everything&amp;quot; type. I seriously can&amp;#39;t go a week without hearing, &amp;quot;I get paranoid, too!&amp;quot; or some shit like that. This person only got &amp;quot;paranoid&amp;quot; and started &amp;quot;hallucinating&amp;quot; after I decided to vent about my problems. As much as I genuinely dislike this person, they&amp;#39;re one of the only people I have at this point.

,schizophrenia,"Hello community,

Most of the time I am fairly quick to identify delusions and such but lately I feel like I want to believe them. Like quit fighting it all and just give in to the idea that it is all real and as such I’m not sick. 
I draw a lot usually but I sometimes feel like it’s not enough. I feel an urge to speak out. Speak with that doll. Speak with that teddy bear. Yell for help. But instead I’m putting so much energy in maintaining a mask. For once I would like to drop it. Once in a while I would like to just be crazy to others or so. But I’m also scared that if I ever drop that mask I can’t get it back. 
I live with my mom and a caretaker who kind of monitor me. 
Do you think it would be a bad thing to purposely give delusions a time and place to be? 

(P.S.: English isn’t my birth language so it might be that I miss-used certain terms and words.)

I'm an artist with a total experience of 2 years.

3 years ago, I quietly observed this server, and now in 2024, I'm genuinely amazed by its growth! From selfies to the incredible support for those with schizophrenia, this place is an endless source of inspiration. 

 Through this space, I've formed invaluable friendships online. This server remains my first online community, and as I continue learning, I hope to contribute my growing fledgling artistry.

In my art journey and overall life, I was thinking I was gonna just pop back in when I become a pro, but then I realize to become a pro who is relevant to the server, I'm actually gonna need to share comics, even if they are not the ultimate comics this server deserves! 😅

,schizophrenia,"Hi, so it’s been 5 years since I was diagnosed with catatonic schizophrenia. I had my first episode after when I just turned 20.

I had the “Truman” experience where I felt like I was acting in a movie or was preparing to act in a movie. 

After these episodes I went into a coma like state or into a catatonic state where I didn’t want to move or even blink my eyes in the hospital. That lasted for 2 weeks and then the medication started working and I wanted to move again..

Well, me believing that I was about to be in a movie awakened this kind of new spark within myself where I developed an interest in acting, writing, films and in becoming a somebody. 

I pursued acting, went to film school and I wrote a screenplay for a feature length film which me, my dad and a crew finished shooting in the summer of last year. The film will come out this year in september and I’m very excited. I will graduate from the film school this may. 

The voices still haven’t gone completely but does anyone else sometimes feel grateful? Of course I have my down days and moments where I feel like I can’t go on but honestly I wrote this film from my life experience and why I think psychologically that I got schizophrenia and I have all of this passion now to become a somebody when all that I was before was a depressed, unhappy suicidal person that didn’t know their way in life or have any reason to live.

I want to make some friends on here or just read your guys posts so that I will feel less alone admist all of the “normal” people in the world. Which is why I’m reaching out on here.

Hi! I am diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia since more than 20 years and before getting sick, I was in very good shape. I was prescribed Zypexa and I gained a lot of weight. I know meds can do that. I’m not on Zyprexa anymore as they switched to a combination of Risperdal and Abilify.

I am no longer in shape, however a friend recommended that I look at Dr. Chris Palmer: Diet &amp; Nutrition for Mental Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #99

In this podcast, Dr. Chris Palmer (psychiatrist) suggests that a keto diet could improve mental health and help to lose weight.

I tried keto and lost about 5 kg in less than 3 months. I’m not on a keto diet anymore but I feel much more lucid, energetic, motivated and confident, and since I know more how to eat to prevent weight gain, my weight is relatively stable at -5kg.

My ex gf has schizophrenia and has not been able to take her medication for quite some time due to insurance dropping her. She was gradually getting worse with the symptoms ( zoning out, audio and visual hallucinations, adisorganized behavior,anxiety). But I didn’t mind and would let her ride it out and give her support where I could.  

Just weeks ago we were having a good time and I even got her a promise ring she wanted. She recently got really cold and broke up with me saying she feels overwhelmed with all the stuff going on in life. 



When we  talked a few days after the breakup so I could get closure she got upset and was saying that I was telling lots people of people  about our relationship. I have only told one person, my close friend and it was just about how I was feeling sad about losing her. I am worried she might be having delusions? 


I understand where she is coming from about feeling overwhelmed and I respect it. But I can’t help but think that this breakup is almost induced by her mental illness not being treated :(

So my brother is completely crazy, and dangerous. He has been like this since 2020, he has been in the psych ward several times, but they always sent him back, they gave him all the reports because he is an adult.
This is the biggest problem, we can't force him to take medication, or to be under any treatment, because the hungarian goverment sees him as a healthy adult, who is able to make his own choices.
We have no clue what to do, his condition is getting worse and worse and he is very violent.
We cant make him take medication, the psych ward sent him back several times, and he makes living a nightmare, we are clueless, so if any of you guys have an idea, a story or anything that could help, it would be much appreciated.
