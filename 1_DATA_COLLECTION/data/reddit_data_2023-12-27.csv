,Army,"I know it's a long shot being on Reddit but I thought I'd see if anybody here perhaps knows someone who knows someone involved in unit history for the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment?  I know the 11th ACR is now at Fort Irwin, CA as the OPFOR unit at NTC.  

Reason I'm asking is that my dad, who passed away in 2020, was in the 11th ACR at two very significant times in their history:  During the Cold War in Germany from 1959 - 1963 and in Vietnam from 1966 - 67.  In fact, Dad was recalled to active duty in the Summer of 1966 when I was 4 years old and we briefly moved to Fort Meade, MD, where the regiment trained up for their deployment.  Then in late Summer they sailed from San Francisco to Vietnam.  Dad was an officer (1LT when he was reactivated and he made Captain while he was in Vietnam.)  I think his last job was Regimental Assistant S3 Air.  

Anyway, when my dad passed away I got a box of ""stuff"" much of which relates to his time with the 11th Cav.  I'm almost 62 and have no kids, and I'd rather give it to a historian than just toss it in the trash.

,Army,"Hello everyone,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I was previously in the army reserve for 6 years. As soon as I switched into active duty, I noticed I was being paid at 0 years TIS instead of 6 years. I immediately went to finance to try to get it fixed and they pointed me to retention. 

I submitted an MMPA packet to retention that corrected my BASD giving me an extra 8-9 months of active duty time, but my PEBD remained the same. Since then, I've been following up with retention every 1-2 months for updates on getting it fixed. Fast forward to now, apparently an MMPA wasn't even what was needed to getting my PEBD (TIS pay) fixed; rather it needed to be my retirement points and a 1506. My brigade retention submitted the 1506 after my battalion retention NCO PCS'd recently, but DFAS pushed it back for an error after 60 days. 

After 30 days of waiting for my brigade retention NCO to resubmit it with the fix, he ended up resubmitting the same 1506 with no changes to DFAS thinking for some reason that it was never submitted in the first place and that the base finance civilian pushed it back to us even though she literally emailed us both with the case number and I called DFAS to check the status on it.

Do you guys think I've given it enough time for retention to fix this issue? I'm going on terminal leave in 4 months and based on my calculations, I'm owed like $18,000 pretax in back pay. I have zero hope for the army to fix my pay once I'm out as a civilian.

Thank you for not shrugging me off. 

Since this entire ordeal began in March you are the first clinical staff member who took me seriously from the beginning and sought to help me. I can't express clearly how much I appreciate you, sir. 

This medical journey has taught me that DHA, MEDCOMM and especially BACH are lousy and unreliable, unless you're trying to get lectured on malingering. However, you have given me hope that not everyone is a brain-dead practitioner. I mean this with zero disrespect. 

As I sit in my hospital room in Nashville, I am grateful that the Army has good practitioners like you who take their patients concerns to heart and seek to find them relief. Thank you sir, from the bottom of my heart.

,Army,"Hi yall.
Need some help in regulations.
My situation is that I picked up in October, and pinned a week in. Was gonna move out in November because unit was too darn busy to take Permissive TDY and I was In ALC phase 1(I do what them days to do stuff).
November, got DA selected for recruiting as part of that scare while is ALC Phase 1.
Got magic and shoved to the right in March.
Got required MOS training in December with days out of training only myself for my critical section(no time to house hunt.

Got ALC Phase 2 in Jan and get out Feb.
Don't know if after completing recruiting I will be PCSed or not despite not having the time in service and I won't have it(not reenlisting)

Not gonna go through everything to get a place in February to just risk breaking contract  and waste time if I have to move.

Immediate leadership tracking and even CSM cool with it. Been worried about brigade finding out and pushing the issue and with every manner of rank asking me questions.

Can't find anything in post or Army regs that say ""must"" vs ""can"" or ""may"".

,Army,"Hope everyone had a good Christmas. Was reading my journal from BCT and having a laugh. What are some of y’all’s favorite BCT memories? 

I’ll share one: 

Drill Sgt Johnson (fake name) instructs us that he wants each bay to tell him a joke when he comes up for toes on line before lights out. Lit. 

DS Johnson comes into the bay, gets his count and then asks for his joke.

My battle asks “DS Johnson, have you heard the joke about the three midgets?” 

DS Johnson replies “no.”

Perfect. 
My battle starts the joke saying:  

“Ok so there are three midgets all sitting around talking. One realizes, “hey! I have really small hands” and decides that he will get it verified by the Guinness book of world records to see if he has the smallest hands in the world. 

The next midget looks down and says “gee, I think I might have the smallest feet in the world. I’ll go too!”

Finally the third midget looks down and goes “damn. I think I’ve got the smallest dick in the world, I’d better tag along and see if I can get the world record too!” 

So the next day they all walk in to the Guinness book of world records office. 

The first midget walks out after about an hour and a half with a huge grin on his face. “I got it! I have the smallest hands in the world!” He exclaims. 

The second midget comes out about thirty minutes later, smiling ear to ear. He says the same thing “I have the smallest feet in the world!” 

Finally, the third midget comes out of the office shortly after the second. He looks shaken up and really disappointed. His buddies ask “what happened!” 

The third midget, defeated, cried out  “WHO THE HELL IS DRILL SGT JOHNSON?!?”

&lt;p&gt;I am particularly interested in the medical field. Specifically pediatrics or emergency care. All of the MOS&amp;#39; I am interested say the requirement is for me to already have a degree, am I reading too much into that or do I already have to have a license? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I am 20 years old and I will be 21 in March. Some of the MOS&amp;#39; I am interested in require me to be 21. Is that when I enlist or do they mean you have to be 21 before you start actually working that MOS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are any nurses or OBs here that could shed some light on me I would really appreciate it. &lt;/p&gt;

And high in the sky
A single, lone plane
Through the air did fly

On board a Paratrooper
And pallets of toys
Ready for heavy drop
To good girls and boys

Now Santa stands ready
Only ten minutes more
The jumpmaster says
""Stand in the door!""

Santa Claus jumps out
As the red light turns green
His parachute rigged toys
From the ground can be seen

The toys fall in chimneys
All across the land
Bringing joy and smiles
And a Christmas so grand

The Christmas drop was successful
And Santa PLFs with precision
Because Santa is a Paratrooper

Mike covers the impact of death, and what killing is like from his perspective as he saw it firsthand in October 1967. This interview covers graphic information about killing and Mike&amp;#39;s experience with it, viewer discretion is advised.&lt;/p&gt;

First, I understand that this is a USMC thread but I am not a marine. I am a Corpsman’s that’s been green for my entire career. I understand the traditions and ways of the Corps more than the Navy. 

I overheard a few young marines that were talking about how they wanted to go to war and couldn’t wait. How they wanted to get a CAR or Purple Heart (Why you would want to be injured is beyond me). I have experienced my fair share, and I of course did not enjoy it. War reminds me of the ultimate sacrifice my brothers and friends made, the broken families, and the forever changed… Although I am still young (29), I feel as if the younger generations day dreams are a old man’s nightmares…

&lt;p&gt;They said I’ll be there for a good 2-4 years meaning it must be pretty good for people to wanna stay there a long time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will let you know how it goes they said it’ll knock the socks off me…or did they say it’ll knock the sanity out of me? Idk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew marine recruiters could be trusted he must really like me to send me here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. it’s open to the public so there must be plenty of women vacationing here too??&lt;/p&gt;

,USMC,"It’s a novel about PTSD, the persistence of memory, existentialism, and the absurdity of war; written by a guy who was in combat during the Battle of the Bulge, was captured by the Germans, and was a prisoner of war in Dresden during the infamous allied fire bombing of the city. 

It uses science fiction as a framing device and it’s super easy to read; if a bit scattered at times, in classic Vonnegut style. 

This passage really impacted me, and it’s one of many: 

&gt;It was a movie about American bombers in World War II and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this: American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.

&gt;The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers , and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.

&gt;When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas.

To explain from the beginning, I had just dropped out of the reserves after a mobilization so I could do a private security contract overseas. I was prior active, only went in the reserves to try it out and I luckily got mobilized to do OAW with the refugee crisis.

I knew my contract was about to be over within 8 months but I had intentions to re-enlist in the IRR for personal reasons. ATM it sounded more simpler, and I was able to do it while in a different country.

Long story short, due to complications, I couldn’t and just decided to move on. Until I was contacted by a prior service recruiter, asking if I wanted to re-up since I only had a month left on my contract.

He basically said he could temporarily drop me in a reserve unit and get an emergency extension and drop me out so I can re enlist in the IRR. Since retention is so bad, he said he does it all of the time.

I explained my situation entirely and how I can’t because I’m working in a different country and I won’t be able to check in the unit or make any drills for a year. He said not to worry, I wouldn’t have to make that months drill or the next because the unit was doing AIT in 29 palms and the next month was a blackout (no drill). He will do all of the work and have me in and out. 

I was skeptical but I was desperate. I did it, he said he would do all of the work. Even comforted me by saying this is all legal cause you definitely have to do this process in person.

Well after he dropped me in and 2 weeks go by with no word, I called him to check in. Basically said he was busy so he pushed me to some E-5 career planner that was fresh to the company, knew him when I was in that same company.

I called the company career planner and he had no idea about my situation so I had to explain everything. He said he’ll take care of my emergency extension and my drop out papers simultaneously so I would have to show up for drill. 

2 more weeks go by and I check in again, he basically said he pushed me to S-1 and gave me their office phone (which didn’t work). I saw what was going on and got pissed. I said fuck it and was just gonna wait until my contract was finished, I had other shit to worry about at the time.

3 months go by and I get a called from this aggressive SSGT accusing me of being UA for like 3-4 months and I explained my situation and he then start throwing more charges like falsifying paper work. Apparently if I didn’t show up immediately they would take away my earned benefits and drop my Honorable discharge. So I naturally freaked out.

I called the company 1 sgt and explained everything and he basically calmed me down, and told me he would set a meeting up with the CO/XO. 

During the meeting it was explained to me that my situation just sounded like a huge communication error and they would work with me. Basically they will just drop me out and forget everything, swept everything under the rug.

Not the type of person to blame everything on the Marine Corps but I really felt used in this situation, like just a body to fill someone’s quota. But I do admit I share complete responsibility in this as well.

,USMC,"So for context, during World War 2, there are credible sources/accounts that Nazi commanders supplied their troops with pharmaceutical grade methamphetamines to further improve their durability in combat. Historians even credit this as one of the reasons why their “Blitzkrieg” warfare was so effective.

I’ll try and make it short and simple, but for this hypothetical scenario:

The US had been at war with a near peer adversary with extensive combat operations around the globe for the past 2 years.

You’re the Squad leader of a very experienced, yet battle fatigued rifle squad that has been conducting various and rigorous missions for the past 2 months and have yet to be rotated out, you have 1 more crucial mission before rotation.

You’re squad has taken casualties but still combat effective and can still confidently handle anything scenario. But after accessing your Marines welfare, you can blatantly tell that the war has chipped away at their physical, mental, and spiritual well-being and it has taken a blatant toll on moral and you fear the unit’s combat effectiveness.

On your last patrol, you intercepted an enemy recon patrol and terminated the threat. You task one of your TLs to conduct TSE and they found a supply of pharmaceutical grade methamphetamine tablets on the EKIA. You confiscated them because they might assist you and your squad later.

You’re currently conducting rehearsals with your squad after getting a Warn-O for a company night raid on a heavily fortified compound. You remember the meth tablets and consider supplying them to your troops to further increase their combat effectiveness.

Knowing the legal ramifications and penalty under the UCMJ of caught and the moral/ethical issues with drug use… Do you allow your Marines, under their consent, to take these drugs to further increase their combat effectiveness for this specific mission? Why or why not?

I thought lithium was the reason I couldn't loose weight, nope. I successfully quit lithium and am stable without it! But still no weight loss; I've been going back and fourth with ozempic and mounjaro since January and STILL no weight loss. 

During the day I eat what I have to in order to give my body proper nutrients but I'm honestly not that hungry...until the binge eating kicks in. I binge while I'm practically still sleeping.

The medication regimen I'm on is by far the most effective for my Bipolar. I've also read that contrave helps with binge eating. Should I look at other medications to help with this issue??

,bipolar,"
Just wanted to jot down my own thoughts, feel free to share your own journey. 

During the summer I had a mental breakdown (this is what my therapist called it) which led to me taking a decent attempt at my life. 

What followed was months of depression and a whole lot of suicidal ideation. I honestly didn't think I would get out of that hole/couldn't see a way out of it.

Very slowly, with therapy sessions every week, I'm at the stage today where I can breathe without feeling suffocated. I've gone from a very high safety risk to a very low risk with little to no suicidal ideation. 

I never thought I would get to the stage of looking forward to what the future brings. (No job, on disability, with half a degree) but I no longer care about all of that stuff. It took me 27 years to finally start caring about my own self.

By dissociate, I mean getting holed up at home and simply shutting off reality - not checking my phone, emails, not answering anything - and sleeping excessively or just devoting my waking hours to learning more about some of my obsessions, daydreaming or binge-watching shows. Anyway, it's always an activity that's not integral to my life in any way. I stop reading, learning, communicating, working, writing... and just exist on another level, untouchable, unfocused, unbothered by Life. I live for that feeling of being disconnected.

Yeah, that's how it feels... as if though I have succeeded at hiding from space and time, and god-awful messaging apps.

Actually, even on a good day (being productive, active, etc), in the evening I must have an hour or two of total dissociation, just existing in a fantasy world, before going to bed. It's like I need to wash off reality from me.

This is causing shitstorms in my life... I forget to reply something important to someone, I tend to forget or cancel my client appointments, I might overlook a super crucial email... it makes me look flaky, uninterested, irresponsible.... and I hate that, especially now as I'm doing all I can to rebuild a worthy life for myself.... but it happens all the time... it's like a super strong need within me, it's like I can't live without taking pauses from this world.

My family will frantically be calling and texting me but I just won’t answer them and make them think something awful happened to me. My most recent and most dangerous one happened tonight. I walked probably about 30 minutes in pitch black darkness on a busy highway from my grandparents house to my house: everyone was frantically calling me but I ignored everything. It all happened over a fight I had with my mother and sister. I’ve also had a pretty rough few days.
Does anyone else do this? I’m worried that one day I do something like this and get myself in a legit dangerous situation. I scared my mother so much she won’t speak to me.

I'm also sorry if this post comes out weird formatting-wise, I am not super familiar with Reddit. Final apology, I did not find any duplicates of these questions but I apologize if I maybe just missed them.

I have two real questions about my depressive episodes.

My first, is there a difference between a depressive episode and just experiencing sad things in life?I have been really depressed for a while. It's been about the same amount of time as previous depressive episodes except where those didn't have a reason, I believe this one has come as a direct result of a problem I've been dealing with with a really close friend.

I know that not every time I get sad is a depressive episode. And I know that people without bipolar disorder get sad. But is being depressed and miserable for weeks because of a problem that's been persisting for weeks a depressive episode? Or am I just sad? Does that make sense?

And second is about insomnia. In this depression I've been dealing with for the last couple months, I haven't been sleeping much at all. The most I've slept on any given night is just under four hours and even that was kind of a miracle.

I'm not doing anything stimulating, all devices are powered off and put away, I just stare at the ceiling for hours. Sometimes thinking, sometimes not thinking at all. I am constantly exhausted but no matter how tired I am, I cannot sleep even a little bit.

I have tried melatonin, magnesium, and every other thing I could find on the internet, but nothing's helped. And I can't do prescription sleep medication because I have a history of abusing them.

So my question is is this normal? Is there anything I can do? Or do I just kind of have to ride it out?

,bipolar,"I feel like I've just been slapped in the face by a depression ghost. Like it just snuck up behind me, knocked the wind out of my lungs and sucked every atom of goodness from my body in literal seconds.

For context, I was diagnosed bipolar three years ago and have managed it successfully with meds. I can work late, stress moderately, enjoy the occassional drink, and even pull off the odd all-nighter, all without any serious shift in mood. 

But after spending most of today with friends and family, laughing over a few beers, I got home, walked into my bedroom and just felt the life drain out of me.

I very nearly forgot what this kind of depression felt like.
It's this thick cloud of darkness that swallows you up. 
An unbearable weight of despair, from which only thoughts of worthlessness and paranoia can grow. 
A sadness so deep, without reason or explanation, that it ignites fear - fear that it cannot be justified or controlled.
Fear that no one will understand, or would want to understand. 
Fear that I am alone. 
I look in the mirror and wonder why I even exist. Everything around me is grey and lifeless and I feel useless and pathetic. I start to believe that my life contributes nothing to this world and that my existence is a bane to all those around me.

Its been a while since I last felt this way and I have no idea what triggered this episode.. But previous experience has taught me a few coping techniques:

- Sleep is usually always the best remedy. 
- As painful as it feels now, its usually less so by tomorrow. 
- And an early dose of (prescribed) quetiapine can bring sleep on much, much quicker. 
- If the above doesn't work then I know to call my psychiatrist for help. 
Knowing all of this is usually the reassurance I need to get me through the day.


I actually came here to remind myself that depression is a familiar burden shared by many in this sub. I remember that I am not alone, and that in itself is a relief. 
I also wanted to document this experience for myself, as a kind of reassuring memo for future episodes. But now that it's written, I've decided to post it instead. And maybe..hopefully.. my shared experience might ease the burden of another bipolar soul in need.

,bipolar,"Hi all. I live with Bipolar II, and it has been in remission for years. I was starting to think I had finally figured out how to live with it. Until a couple months ago. It started with uncontrollable tears. Everyday, throughout the day, for no reason. I would cry at work. In public walking my dog. In the bread aisle. I started experiencing more depression symptoms, until they stopped abruptly. I quit my job on a whim (a good job, in a great city). I wanted to see if the tears would stop if I quit work. The impulsivity only escalated from there. Hypersexuality, sleepless nights spent deep-cleaning my already very clean apartment or playing with my dog. Reading books. Writing. Everything every therapist has ever told me to do. But I couldn’t seem to de-escalate. I got a new job, quit that one after day 3. I moved back in with my parents and started another job. Two weeks ago, I got fired from that job. Haven’t been sleeping well since. I even slept with my ex supervisor (3 days after he watched me get fired).

,bipolar,"So, I'm feeling desire for ""bad"" things. Like things I limit myself or have limits on. Because I view them as negative or that they could be detrimental to me. 

For example, I've never had a cigarette in my life, don't want to start, have sworn them off because everyone growing up chain smoked and it disgusts me. But the last few weeks I've had the thought EVERY time I go to a gas station ""maybe I should buy some cigarettes or a vape"" and I feel ashamed immediately after. Today, I wanted to buy scratch offs. Which I know aren't as bad and every year or two I will buy some, but I try not to. And there's tons of other things I desire or am slightly giving in to that aren't as ""good"" for me. Like super horny and taking risks with that. But the cigarettes and scratch offs are new thoughts. 

I'm doing good things more, too, though. Like, I've started working out a little more. I'm drinking less (at home at least). Doing more crafts, I'm finally practicing makeup and hair stuff again. I got a water drinking app that's been helping. Like still doing good things and keeping pretty consistent the last few weeks. 

But it's like my brain wants to just break every rule I have and undo any good stuff and do all these ""bad"" things. It's so frustrating. I've worked really hard my whole life to try to control, try to maintain at least decent health if no energy for really good. But like, why all of a sudden am I constantly itching for these random things? I'm feeling a bit depressed and lonely and lost lately, but am still going out and hanging and talking to friends.

These impulsive/intrusive thoughts just itch at the back of my mind. I don't know what to do or how I should feel about myself. I've also had a lot of suicidal thoughts that I've been managing so I'm wondering if maybe this is my brain trying to still self destruct because I'm not doing that. It's just making it hard to take preventive action to keep myself in a good place.

I live REALLY far from family, and I've got two kids. So twice a year we travel to see them. It's 14 hours of driving while juggling the constant needs of the kids. We get to bed after 2am and it takes absurd amounts of caffeine. 


Without fail, the trip makes things worse mental health wise. Especially the winter trip. On top of that there's some really big family stuff going on and I know that's going to be something I have to dance around and just shut down any internal response to.

&lt;p&gt;The good part is that my family have a clear view of how I am. Also, therapy (psychotherapy) and psychiatrist sessions are way easier, since it flows better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got curious. What about you guys? Do you share about your episodes and BD at all? And if you do, do you share just enough or you feel like oversharing?&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"hello, this is my first time posting here. i (22F) was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2 which honestly has been really hard for me to accept. i haven't taken medication out of fears of 1) weight-gain (i have an ED) and 2) that i'm not actually bipolar. 

my mom (57F) and i do not get along. i see myself as a very level-headed person, while she just seems outright delusional most of the time. she always yelled at me over random unimportant things as a child. insults my appearance a lot, and overall was always hostile while I was growing up. this has caused me to resent her a lot, which is hard for me to admit. I am very irritable and rude toward her, but i'm not quite sure if the irritability is a bipolar thing or if its just because i simply do not like her. 

today, we had a huge fight. she called me out for being rude all the time, and i ended up just telling her straight-up that i resented her and listed all the things that made me resent her over the years. she denied all of it and said i was making things up, which i am not. she started crying because she couldn't handle my brutal honesty.

however, no matter how many times i try to communicate how she has made me feel, she always denies it. straight up tries to gaslight me into thinking she's never done anything wrong. but every hour she screams about something, complains, yells, freaks out over nothing. it's exhausting.

so later today, she sends me a huge text basically saying that i need to start taking meds for my bipolar because it's making me irritable and that i'm ""making mountains out of mole hills,"" which she also attributes to BD. **but honestly, i feel like she is using my recent diagnosis to dismiss my feelings and words to make her feel better about herself.** 

so i guess my question is this: **how do you differentiate between genuine emotions vs bipolar irritation/paranoia?** i know i am not paranoid about the way she has treated me because my non-BD siblings feel the same way as me about the things she has done. i feel like i'm going crazy because i feel like my emotions are not irrational considering her words and actions toward me, but her dismissal of my emotions because of my recent diagnosis is making me second guess myself. what's real and what isn't? it's all just very confusing :( any advice?

He told me its not bec of me. I know and I understand. But intrusive thoughts just keeps on coming.  He also dont want this topic being opened up. He initially wanted a cool off and I said I cant.. But my thoughts are always on rampage and its affecting everything... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Maybe my bipolar added to his unhappiness&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If he&amp;#39;s with somebody normal would he be more happy?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can I still share my emotional problems? Or is it too much&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He looks sad, did I trigger something for him to be sad?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I want reassurance but its hard right now. Can I ask him?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s not responding to messages as he did before. Is he already thinking of leaving me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; I need to be very careful not to have an episode as it might push him to leave me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Am I capable of making someone happy?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Will he be really happy with me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"Hello! 

I am writing this because I need some perspective, insights and experiences. 

  
I have been diagnosed for roughly a year, but I have had this disorder for about 2.5-3 years. During this time I have never told my family, they know nothing about my well-being and I have liked to keep it separate. I live in another city and only see them once or twice a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the issue is that my conversation therapist has been pushing me lately to tell them. He believes that this would drop a stone off my shoulders. While he is likely correct, I can only see bad things coming out of this. My family very rarely talk about our issues and pains. Cronical illnesses are mentioned in passing by and serious pain is kept under the rug. This isn't healthy or good but it is how we do things. However, I also know that by telling my mother, the rest of my family and relatives would know within a week. I wouldn't want this. I also know that I would never get a moment of peace after telling her, everything would become about my well-being and she would never see me anymore only the disorder. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anyone like me who didn't want to tell anyone but eventually did? What were the outcomes, do you regret it, etc. etc.

,bipolar,"hey everyone this is my second ever reddit post so bear with me please. 

21F, i was diagnosed around 1.5/2 years ago after i had my first manic episode. i have also been diagnosed with GAD, a dissociative disorder, and PTSD. i am unmedicated for all of these willingly as i was on abilify, but could not take it consistently and my parents worried about the physical effects of going off and on meds (family history of blood clots, stroke, etc.). i started using daylio to track my moods and have worked on a lot of grounding/coping mechanisms to somewhat alleviate my various symptoms.

i’ve been staying with my family who i haven’t seen in a few years (i grew up with them but moved across the US when i was 15) and while it has been lovely, they are in poor health. my time here has been very sweet and i’ve been feeling good, but i can tell when i leave in a few days i’m probably going to have a depressive episode. 

i’ve dealt with my depression fairly well through my life, and i can identify it easily before i’m truly in the throes of it. the last true depressive episode i had was entirely different because i had what i can only describe as symptoms of psychosis (hallucinations, ideation, paranoia). does anyone have any tips on how to manage those symptoms if they come up? last time this happened i was on “watch” for two weeks and couldn’t work, which i can’t do this time due to my financial situation. 

i am also wondering if anyone has any tricks to identifying manic episodes. i’ve had a few but until i was diagnosed after my first, i hadn’t experienced that before. i tend to not understand my mania until i’m at the tail end of an episode, usually after i’ve done something reckless/“bad” (spending money, getting new jobs, driving for extreme amounts of time/traveling, etc.) i’m worried this time because if i am about to have a depressive episode, my family has expressed to me that i could move with them back to my home town. im worried that i will take them up on this offer and not completely think it through (leaving my current primary support system for a cross country move) 

i think the fact that im thinking about this now is a good sign, but i tend to dissociate during my manic episodes so im not sure if ill even remember the pros and cons of moving back to be with my family. 

any tips are appreciated, sorry for word vomiting &lt;3",t2_d8ur0xj8,False,,0,False,Struggling identifying episodes/ managing functioning,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18r2mqg,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Support/Advice :shy:,False,2,,False,False,nsfw,False,,[],{},,True,,1703575337.0,richtext,,,,text,self.bipolar,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hey everyone this is my second ever reddit post so bear with me please. &lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"First off, i wanna start by saying that this is pretty long.
If you don’t give a shit i completely understand, have a peaceful day. 

So, i’ve always fought to get a diagnosis because i thought that it would validate my experience and people would finally stop treating me like i’m exaggerating. Ive been to the psych clinic 2 times this year and i’ve been on meds and all that. But i hadn’t seen it on paper you know. And recently i finally did. Turns out i was diagnosed with bipolar? They just didn’t tell me. And now i feel empty and sad. I don’t want that diagnosis anymore because i feel like i can’t go back you know? It would be for life if i wasn’t diagnosed too but this feels more official. Everytime i see something about bipolar being for life, tears well in my eyes. Like yea congrats you’re stuck with this because we said so, the only thing you can do about it is take those meds that you hate and pay for expensive therapy sessions. 

I feel like an ingrate. I wanted someone to tell me that i wasn’t delusional but now that it has happened, i want the opposite. Please go back on your words and tell me it was just a phase and i won’t have to seriously consider ending it all anymore. I think i was in deep denial, in more than one way. I wanted to reassure myself that i wasn’t « worthless to society » and just a product of my trauma. But thinking about it now, i don’t actually give a shit about pleasing anyone in this depressing world. Am i fraud?
I’m conflicted because on one hand i don’t wanna be a burden to the people i genuinely care about, but on the other hand i don’t wanna be a « useful member of society » because i despise this disgusting society i live in. Besides the people i love i can’t think of a single reason i would want to hang on. I find fault in everything. I’m cynical and negative (i’m probably only saying this bc i’m depressed rn but whatever). I just can’t help myself, i don’t wanna keep the peace and no matter how hard i try to convince myself otherwise, i almost never want to put in effort. 
I know i’m not a terrible person, i have values, i try to help people as best as i can and i would never hurt anyone intentionally. So why do i feel so stupid and mean and unreasonable ??? :(

,schizophrenia,"I (30F) and my boyfriend (41M) have been having problems in our relationship. We will refer to my boyfriend as Peter from now on. We have been together for the past 2 years and a half. Peter is a very sensitive and empathetic person and I love him a lot but he is severely burnt out mentally. He is the main caregiver along with his aging mother for his schizophrenic brother (30M), let’s call him Tom. My boyfriend lives to take care of Tom financially and emotionally, he says this is main duty in life. Anything that Tom needs Peter does not hesitate to get as he loves his brother deeply and just wants him to have a normal as possible life. Tom is very functional meaning he can complete everyday tasks but lacks awareness that he suffers from schizophrenia. He has been to the psychiatrist and yet still does not believe the diagnosis, does not acknowledge this and thus does not take his anti-psychotic medication. Peter has resorted to putting his medication in his food to control his symptoms which he feels very conflicted and horrible about. This diagnosis was a few years ago. Tom stays at home all day because he does not work, he did not complete his bachelor’s degree as he suffered a psychotic break and was unable to study, thus he spends a lot of time at home on the internet and he smokes around 2 packs of cigarettes per day. He also smokes cannabis which intensifies his behavior where he gets in negative moods and his negative delusions increase. Tom has a lot of delusions of unrealistic ideas e.g. he says he is a therapist and him talking to people means that he has had experience in therapy thus he is a therapist and he has also created an Only Fans in a manic state and does not remember doing so and posting explicit pictures.

Peter is emotionally burnt out as he spends a lot of time talking to his brother trying to reason with him which can go on for hours every day about all his ideas and things he wants to do or courses he wants to pursue. Tom also has a habit of pursuing courses he is unable to complete because he feels much unfilled that he did not complete his degree and is trying to compensate. My boyfriend in turn has to pay for these courses which are sometimes expensive and if he does not pay for it Tom becomes very agitated and unhappy. Peter has tried telling Tom multiple times about his diagnosis but he still refuses to acknowledge this and becomes very angry when this discussion is brought up.

Initially for around the 1st few months of Peter’s and I relationship, I used to spend a lot of time at his house and we would do normal couple things like watch movies, eat together or just spend time together in general. Peter was hesitant to introduce me to Tom initially but we also formed a good relationship. I spent a lot of time talking to Tom about different topics in general and his interests mostly, as he doesn’t have much interest in anything else besides what he wants to talk about. Tom however began to have a problem that I was spending more time with Peter than him. Tom and I are similar ages and he began to compare himself to me academically and financially. For reference Tom and I attended similar schools and we were both academically inclined. I completed my bachelor’s degree and began working soon after, I have a normal 9-5 and he has told Peter that I remind him of all the things he did not accomplish academically. He said that it was hard to be around me because I am a constant reminder of what he did not accomplish. I have never ever flaunted my academics or job and or acted in any way but Tom has built this his reality that I am a sore reminder that he is a failure and that he feels horrible around me. He has also commented on the age gap between Peter and me that it is weird that he and I are similar in ages and that Peter is so much older. Tom also began to have an issue with Peter and spending time together because that I should be talking to him instead. This also contradicts the part where he doesn’t want to be around me because my presence makes him feel less than but that I should talk to him more than Peter.

Eventually it reached a point where I had to stop coming to the house in order to not make Tom uncomfortable. Peter and I are still in a relationship but Tom does not know about it. Peter has told him I had to stop coming to the house because Tom indicated it made him uncomfortable and thus Tom believes we are not in a relationship anymore. It is sometimes stressful for both of us because Tom consistently asks Peter his whereabouts and is consistently checking up on him to see where he is. This in turn stresses Peter as he feels he is being deceitful and in turn it is difficult for me as we don’t spend time together. The most time we spend together is about 2 hours every week as we do not see each other on the weekdays during work as it’s more difficult for Peter to explain where he is.

This may seem strange from the outside looking in as Peter does not need to explain his decision but please bear in mind that Tom in mentally unwell and the way he views things is not through the same perspective as a so-called ‘normal person’. Peter is mostly at home with Tom so that Tom is not alone or has someone to talk to as Tom consistently needs to voice whatever is going on in his head. Tom does not have many friends he can talk to and has isolated himself from family as he also compares himself to family similar in age and what they have accomplished. I have voiced my opinion on what the future for Peter and I may hold as things don’t seem to be changing for the better. Also how is Peter going to explain this in a case we were to get married to Tom that we were still carrying on a relationship all this time? Also Peter has made it clear he has to live in the family home to take care of Tom so how would you explain this? It’s very difficult for Peter to be there for me emotionally as he is consistently worried about Tom and his sometimes unpredictable behavior as this has really worn him out after all these years. This has also affected his last relationship. I do not fault Peter as he is a wonderful guy but I don’t feel fulfilled or see things changing anything soon for us to spend more time as this is a serious issue that Peter cannot control. Any advice, I’m really hurting here as I would never want Peter to think I have abandoned him because of his situation, I try to support him as best as I can emotionally but it’s really taking a toll on me. Peter also suffers from severe depression because of the situation and burnout and I in turn have not been doing well mentally.

,schizophrenia,"Hi, 

I have a friend whos been on aripiprazole and says he noticed when he is on less than 20mg or 15 he starts having trouble with eye contact it seems like his mind and sight is blurry. In addition, he says hes into porn and its getting out of hand he usually browse websites for escorts. He says he been watching deviant porn before being on meds years back, but it was exacerbated with smoking weed (which hes done for 2 years and stopped in 2013)
He got the abilify maintena injection (LAI) he felt clear headed the first 5 days with no porn cravings. However the cravings now have gradually resurfaced to his mind its day 6 now since the LAI. He feels clear headed with decent eye contact, a bit anxious of what he did yesterday. 
Abilify is a good medication but is the hypersexuality caused by the med or God forbids it’s just him. I am thinking of suggesting to switch to invega LAI that gets rid of the craving and ecstatic behavior on porn web, however it lowers the lobido (doesnt mind that) and you cant ejaculate semen while on it (so how is he going to create a family on it) makes him less dynamic in his thinking and he is slower when talking in his second language. 
A psychiatrist suggested to take abilify maintena and a bit of clozapine to counter its compulsive behavior.

,schizophrenia,"Hi everyone, and thank you in advance for any advice.

I am in the US. My brother was hospitalized involuntarily on the 24th (Sunday). He is now on a 10 day hold. He will not take meds on his own, and is not med compliant in these scenarios. His symptoms are very severe right now, to the point where he is not able to recognize our parents. 

If they can get him stable enough to have a cohesive conversation I would love to tell him that if he is compliant he can at least choose what medication he is on, but if he continues to be noncompliant he will be forcibly medicated with whatever the doctor deems appropriate, with a long acting med. This has happened in the past.

He signed a HIPPA release for my mom to talk to the doctors (which is amazing considering he could not recognize her) so she may be able to say “please don’t give him X, try X instead.”

In the past he’s been given risperadone and more recently they put him on haldol, which he seemed ok on but very depressed although that’s unfortunately expected.

I’m wondering if someone is forcibly medicated if the schizophrenic community has any preferred vs. less preferred choices of the long acting meds. I wish he would comply because that way he can choose which meds to try and adjust the dose etc., but unfortunately that’s just not going to be the case in this instance.

TL:DR - if someone is going to be court ordered/forcibly medicated, what are the best choices and what should be avoided?

,schizophrenia,"tw: suicide


my beautiful boyfriend took his own life ago after his very intense battle with schizophrenia. he always struggled with mental illness but didn't start having delusions/psychotic episodes until this year. he was hospitalized twice and then a week after his second stay, he died. it was very gory and i never ever would have thought he would have taken his life in /that/ way.

i have a few questions about some of his delusions/just general things he did. i have tried so hard to educate myself on schizophrenia since his diagnosis and after his passing.

maybe it's more like describing things he did than they are questions.

-he was very much convinced that he was black/latino when in reality he was very white lol. he drove a black car and said that white cars were racist and that they hated him because he was in a black car

-he drove very erratically and eventually was no longer allowed to drive because he was constantly nearly getting us into accidents. he would weave in and out of vehicles, get over on top of them, speed, run lights, etc.

-he was obsessed with gang culture. he loved this movie called blood in blood out. talked about it all the time and seemed inspired by it.

-only listened to rap music (literally no problem but he has always been more of a post punk kinda guy)

-suddenly a born again catholic (he grew up baptist but always identified as agnostic). i know that those with schizophrenia can often become religious without any previous interest.

-always told me he could smell when i was ovulating. became obsessed with women's cycles.

-believed that swingers were out to get him and wanted to r*pe him.

there's probably so much more i never even witnessed. one time his friends took him to a movie and said that they heard him whispering to himself and then holding out the letter ""c"" with his hands and telling them it stood for comfort.

i asked him several times if he heard voices. i'm assuming he was lying when he told me no.

the last few days of his life he basically went nonverbal, could only pace my apartment, and was terrified someone was out to get him. i found out after taking him home to his mom's that he didn't take his meds the entire time he was in my home. i asked him every morning if he did and he lied. i feel so guilty and his family won't speak to me. i don't really know what i'm looking to achieve by posting here. maybe some insight? he was only 25. i miss him so, so much.

he didn't live with me and we saw each other few times a week. i had to drive two hours each way to bring him to my place and take him home or just spend time at his mom's.

he had no car, barely had a job, no friends in the area, had to move home and drop out of college. i can only imagine the pain and stress he was dealing with.",t2_2vmpuol3,False,,0,False,my boyfriend was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and died a month ago,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18roisc,False,light,0.99,,public,47,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger Warning,False,47,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1703641602.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;tw: suicide&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"I (27F), want to start by saying I am not diagnosed as schizophrenic, I do not believe I am schizophrenic, and I am not looking to be arm chair diagnosed as schizophrenic.

I have OCD, ADHD and possibly bipolar (hypomanic symptoms).

For several years I have felt I can talk to God. No, I don't hear his voice, he doesn't speak to me auditorily, I don't see him. But I would get a lot of signs from the universe and was able to speak to him in a way and get a response. I never spoke to a therapist about this because this is something I quite enjoyed and never thought of as weird.

I was put on Strattera for my ADHD last year. Since then, God has stopped talking to me. It doesn't even make sense because there is no reason to believe Strattera would stop delusions, and it has even been known to induce psychosis in some people.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know whether these were spiritual delusions or not, but I sort of feel maybe they were. It upsets me nothing my once close relationship to God may have all just been in my head. I want to feel close to God and talk to him again, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm just delusional. I felt my spirituality was a huge aspect of my identity and I've lost that part of me. And I feel stupid knowing I would proudly tell people about talking to God, and 'you too can speak to God.' Like obviously I sounded psychotic to these people.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anybody else on this forum felt sad or empty after losing some delusions? Anybody else dealing with something similar? Any advice on how to get my relationship with God back without feeling crazy?

,schizophrenia,"Hello. I am 28. Male. 5'6''. 67 Kg / 148 lbs. Non smoker. Non-drinker. Indian. 

So all this begun in 2013. I was feeling unusually relaxed despite critical test that I was about to appear for. Fast forward 2 months I performed very badly in the test and barely passed. After getting admission in not-so-good college I had episodes of extreme anxiety over high tension wires that was in the locality of my college. You have to pass below those towers to get to the college. I was so scared that i tried to get in other colleges or leave engineering altogether and choose different career option. I was then taken to a career counsellor where they concluded that civil services was actually a better option for me instead of engineering. There the counsellor convinced me to continue engineering and later appear for civil services examination after graduating from engineering college.

 I was convinced and I continued with my engineering career. In 2016 I remember two events that could contribute to my current predicament. One was doing a horrible sin / crime for which I did not at the time feel any remorse. It was after my brother found out about the same I was in shock for a whole evening. The second event involves  me watching a trailer to Bollywood movie which caused sort of existential crisis in me after which I started to read up on religion and spirituality. After graduating in 2017 I was left with question of what to do next. Over the next few years I had similar experiences where my I felt hyperventilated, i felt as if I was naked (despite wearing usual clothing) and my private part was chopped off and my heart had gone weak while surfing the web. My vitamin d3 is 70 ng/ml and b12 is 950 pg/ml. Because I am convinced my illness is because nutritional deficiency I take 2 multivitamins, 1 antioxidant capsule, 1 iron supplement, 1 B-complex capsule, 2 magnesium 200 mg, milk (for calcium), 1/4 zinc acetate (25 mg) On and Off since 6 months. Stopped D3 and B12 after testing and getting high results. I used to take High Dosage supplements for those too for a suspected deficiency. I have been to dozens of medical professionals since 2016 and their diagnosis is schizophrenia, depression and anxiety.

My initial symptoms (since 2019 heart collapse feeling episode) were :

* Feeling restless and weak hearted and spaced out
* experience of life feels shallower than before
* Feels like I am living on autopilot
* Mind feels unusually blank most of time
* thoughts are not vivid as they were before
* Decreased alertness
* Decreased attention
* Brain Fog
* Zoned out most of the time
* Decreased concentration.
* Decreased cognitive abilities
* Decreased mental Faculties
* Confusion 

&amp;#x200B;

After the cocktail of supplements I took in past year original symptoms were not resolved but new scary symptom were added

&amp;#x200B;

* Apathy ( this makes my experience crazier than ever as I just want to sleep all day compared to my previous self which was atleast active and addicted to screen 24/7).
* mind feels numb.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apathy ( this makes my experience crazier than ever as I just want to sleep all day compared to my previous self which was atleast active and addicted to screen 24/7).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mind feels numb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dulled sensory experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

,schizophrenia,"I will start off by saying I'm pretty lucky as I am high-functioning (I got my Masters recently and, as long as I take my medications, I can maintain fairly normal relationships), but it feels like because of that, my friends and family tend to forget that I have a (at times) fairly debilitating condition. 

My paranoia isn't as bad as before I was medicated, but sometimes I just cannot go outside my house, and when I try to explain the reason why, people think I am being lazy or something, so I had to start making up excuses that sound more ""legitimate."" I actually failed a class because of this which delayed my graduation by a semester. People making fun of me for not leaving my house, even if it's a joke, still hurts. 

I DESPISE having my picture taken, being on camera, or being recorded and people immediately assume it's because I don't like how I look or sound or something and try telling me stuff about that even when I explain it has nothing to do with that.

I find it nearly impossible to confide in people because I always have a nagging feeling that they will stab me in the back any second, which makes people think I am distant or cold. My parents always tell me that I should be more open with them and I just don't have the heart to tell them that I do not trust them (or anyone else really).

People don't understand that in the rare moments of time when my mind is clear I need to utilize it and focus on my work/projects for like 18 hours without being interrupted and it makes me upset when I can't do that. Also, just because I have a video/music on my second monitor doesn't mean I'm not being productive, I just need the constant audio to suppress my auditory hallucinations. 

I played on a college esports team and the amount of times I heard things like ""schizo moment"", ""schizo calls"", ""went schizo for a moment"" was unbelievable, especially considering several of them knew I was schizophrenic (I try to be fairly open about it to try and destigmatize as much as I can). 

Had a friend that went through a manic episode and it was honestly disheartening the way my other friends wanted to deal with it (basically just cut him off) before I stepped in to tell them to be a bit more understanding and get him help since he's clearly going through an episode. It only reinforced my fear that if I go through a particularly severe paranoid episode, there might be no one there for me. 

This is not to mention the negative symptoms. Like I'm sorry that I don't have an emotional reaction to anything (other than annoyance sometimes), that my voice is monotone, that it's hard for me to take care of myself or even care about it. I'm trying my best, but sometimes it's not enough. Honestly, started crying as I wrote this and it's the most emotion I've felt in years.

,schizophrenia,"Does anyone else here find the mornings the most difficult part of the day? 

I used to love mornings but lately they're quite challenging. 

I think it might be because my night-time Risperidone has worn off and my morning dose needs a bit of time to kick in, but I always find the first few hours of the day the hardest. It mostly seems to be my energy levels that are affected, I just feel slow and dead in the mornings, but I also feel more anxious and sometimes a little paranoid depending on the day. 

It almost feels like each day I have a mountain to climb, I start off the mountain feeling crappy, then over the first couple of hours of the day I climb up to alright, then by hour 4-5 or so I'm feeling decent, and on good days by hour 7-9 I'll be feeling *good*. Once I'm there I usually stay there for the rest of the day until something happens to throw off my mood, which means every night I'm always dreading going to sleep, because in the night I'm feeling pretty good usually, but at the same time I know the good feeling I have will be gone again in the morning and I'll have to make the climb again.

It's one of the reasons I'm struggling to give up smoking again because in the past I started off weaning off the cigarettes by delaying my morning cigarette as long as possible - but recently my mornings have been rough and those first couple of cigarettes feel like the one thing getting me through it.

,schizophrenia,"hi all,

i’m a fictional author and always trying to include diverse representation in my books. my current work-in-progress is a romance told from the POV of the female main character who falls for the male main character who has schizophrenia. The book is not about the MMC’s schizophrenia, but it is a rather small subplot which i want to be as accurate as possible.

I’ve read through this subreddit a LOT and I have a few unanswered questions:

For those of you that are medicated/in therapy, what are your day to day “symptoms” (forgive me if this is poor terminology)?

Those of you in relationships, what are the best ways your partners have supported you? (Or ways that partners made things harder for you?)

&amp; any other advice I should know? (i.e. poor representations you’ve seen before/things I should avoid?) 

I appreciate this greatly. I can read all day in the DSM-5 or in research journals, but nothing is better than advice straight from the very people I’m attempting to represent. 

To those who reply, if the book gets published (I’m optimistic that it will, but in traditional publishing you never really know), any comments that I utilize in creating this story will get a PM upon completion &amp; I’ll send you a free copy of the novel :)))

I was on meds, couldn&amp;#39;t use to figure out things, was really carefree for another 1 and half year. Then I left my meds, and I realised that I relapsed on schizophrenia. And here I am back from where I started. I was just doing some office work on computer in my father&amp;#39;s office since these years. Whenever I&amp;#39;m on antipsychotics, I have social anxiety and could not interact and when I take antidepressants like es-citalopram I become carefree. Im afraid of taking meds again, cause it really ruined my physical health and body. Please share your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hello,

I don’t know if I have this post tagged right, I apologize if it’s not.  I have some questions and I could really use some advice from people who have experience.

My partner recently had a pretty severe psychotic episode with delusions and hallucinations that landed him in the hospital.  We previously thought he had bipolar disorder, but the doctors thought otherwise after what they observed.  He was communicating to aliens, god, getting messages from tv shows, among other things.  He claimed he was channeling aliens, angels, demons.  Yelling in loud voices and shaking around, laughing hysterically at random points.  Then he’d just stare and not respond, occasionally shaking his head or nodding, chuckling — he was communicating with them, he said.  He’d go through periods of really intense negative emotion, happiness, and no emotion — according to him.  At one point he said he was channeling my spirit that was a demon trying to turn into an angel.  Eventually it subsided to a point that was less outwardly visible, but says the aliens/angels are testing him and making him a better person.  They told him not to lie and are making him tell me things that he has been lying to me about for like over 10 years.  I don’t want to go into details, but I’m reeling because I remember the incidents he’s telling me and remember thinking he was lying to me at the time.  I feel sick and feel like I’m in shock.

My question is, I guess — is it possible for his delusions to cause him to become more honest, like compulsively almost, because he says they’re making him a better person and making him tell the truth?  I’m so confused right now.  And the mood swings and staring off into the distance and not responding are scaring me.

He has an appointment with his psychiatrist soon.  He still doesn’t know what’s going on and I don’t think he can really consider that he could be sick.  I’m not sure how to help him right now.  I have a mental illness myself and I feel like I’m losing my sanity.

I’m not judging him, I realize this is rough.  I feel so bad for him.  :(

,schizophrenia,"I’m a young teen and from the age of 13 I started doing drugs like marijuana, vaping, alcohol and eventually shrooms, I am now 9 months sober but after a few months of smoking weed I started having absolutely brutal psychotic episodes. I’m not sure if they are but I looked up the symptoms for example one of them is “religious delusions” which I usually get each episode, my first episode was probably my worst one it went like this. I was in the bathroom smoking weed and I just wanted to get buzzed as usual so I only took one hit, then a few minutes later it kicked in and it was super strong, I only had one hit so either I got laced with something or my brain just gave up on my weed tolerance, the thing is it took days to go away. When I got home I started getting really agitated for no reason and started pacing back and forth, and I started thinking that there was cameras in my room but I noticed from thinking so much my very ability to think was “fading away” and I somehow convinced myself that I had to make a deal with the devil to get my ability to think back, so I continued to pace back and forth in front of my bed and that was the last thing I remembered, after that I woke up 3 days later on my bed with my laptop open on YouTube, also it was a school week and I lived with my parents so I have no idea what happened because usually my mom would force me to go to school.

I’m not sure if they are but I looked up the symptoms for example one of them is “religious delusions” which I usually get each episode, my first episode was probably my worst one it went like this. I was in the bathroom smoking weed and I just wanted to get buzzed as usual so I only took one hit, then a few minutes later it kicked in and it was super strong, I only had one hit so either I got laced with something or my brain just gave up on my weed tolerance, the thing is it took days to go away. When I got home I started getting really agitated for no reason and started pacing back and forth, and I started thinking that there was cameras in my room but I noticed from thinking so much my very ability to think was “fading away” and I somehow convinced myself that I had to make a deal with the devil to get my ability to think back, so I continued to pace back and forth in front of my bed and that was the last thing I remembered, after that I woke up 3 days later on my bed with my laptop open on YouTube, also it was a school week and I lived with my parents so I have no idea what happened because usually my mom would force me to go to school.

,schizophrenia,"Hi guys,  


I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia 6/7 years ago, I had awful delusions and hallucations, I didn't know what was real and what wasn't, my whole personality changed to try and face the new 'reality' that I was living in. However, with a combination of CBT, Ariprazole, Risperidone and Quetiapine (Not al at once, jesus) I managed to crawl my way out of the delusions, and the hallucinations without the delusions are an irritant at worst.  


But I'm still struggling with the negative symptoms 4/5 years later, I thought the emotional issues were potentially a defence mechanism that my brain would eventually repair, but they're still occuring.   


Let me describe what I'm experiencing now:

  
\- Incredibly low ""social battery"", after 30-60 minutes of conversation, my social battery feels completely empty, I can't think of things to say, I can't join in on any jokes, I pretty much go completely non-verbal for 30 minutes until I recharge, in a group this is fine, but 1 on 1 it makes for pretty awkward situations  


\- Emotional blunting/severe apathy, unless I'm intoxicated, I don't feel any emotion towards what people say or do, I don't get defensive, I don't get upset, I don't get offended, I don't find things funny, I don't express gratitude or love properly, I don't express concern etc. Outwardly I can still express these emotions in pantomine, but some people see straight through me and I can come across as fake or ingenuine. Before the schizophrenia I was a very emotionally intelligent and outwardly displaying person, but now I feel like a borderline psychopath emotionally.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sleep issues, I have never been able to sleep correctly, and can only sleep when I'm on brink of passing out from exhaustion. I've managed to get a 12-8 shift at my 9-5 to allow me to fall asleep at 4/5am without major consequence, but I would like to get some insight on this, and see if it's a result of the negative symptoms or just a personal thing, as I've had trouble with sleep ever since I was a child  


I would be interested to know if anybody has faced these same negative symptoms, and potential solutions to properly mitigate them. The fact that I tend to be okay emotionally when I'm intoxicated makes me think there's some sort of psychological block there, but on the other hand, the increased confidence could just improve my self deception. Either way, this tends to make me use alcohol and substances as a crutch when socialising, which I could do without.

,schizophrenia,"Hello,

My wife has noticed I have good and bad cycles. Ups and Downs. During the downs I’m very withdrawn, inward, and suspicious. During the ups I’m just pretty normal. 

She’s noticed some signs about to have a down. I thought this was interesting and just wanted to share.

1) I’ll get very opinionated and argumentative 

2) I stop really focusing on the current and new and focus more on like existing I guess? Idk she said I get really philosophical and interested in the way the universe is swirling around me and like brushing my teeth. 

3) I either stop eating as much or eat way more. During an up I’ll eat pretty healthy and a lot of different things. When I’m down I eat more hearty comfort meals and nostalgic things that remind me of my childhood.

4) I will do things that bring me a lot of comfort. I’ll start the harry potter series over or lord of the rings. When I’m good I’ll seek out new books.

5) I’ll get really religious when I’m starting to decline too.

I do get some symptoms though and I’ll often just leave social situations when they start kicking in. I’ll give a few examples. I was at a friends and she cooked me dinner then after we ate I kept hearing her ask me why I was there. So I left. I was at a party having a conversation with a couple then another person cut in and started talking to them and I perceived her making comments about me. So I left the party. I was hanging out with two other people watching YouTube and stuff on tv, I got delusions that whenever I touched my face or moved my hands or feet that one of the other people were telling me to do that and I’d only notice after I’d done it. So I left. It’s not necessarily that the thing that got me to leave was so so bad but at this point I just don’t want to fight through symptoms in social situations so I just bail.

I do get some symptoms though and I’ll often just leave social situations when they start kicking in. I’ll give a few examples. I was at a friends and she cooked me dinner then after we ate I kept hearing her ask me why I was there. So I left. I was at a party having a conversation with a couple then another person cut in and started talking to them and I perceived her making comments about me. So I left the party. I was hanging out with two other people watching YouTube and stuff on tv, I got delusions that whenever I touched my face or moved my hands or feet that one of the other people were telling me to do that and I’d only notice after I’d done it. So I left. It’s not necessarily that the thing that got me to leave was so so bad but at this point I just don’t want to fight through symptoms in social situations so I just bail. But then I think, am I making things worse by not enduring it? Like my tolerance for social situations will just degrade further and further until I can’t handle anything. What do you think? And is there another good approach than just leaving? I just have less tolerance for enduring the crap than I used to.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"I want to preface by saying I currently see a psychiatrist for different things (ASD,ADHD,GAD and MDD). I also have background knowledge in the topic. 

I will also preface, I am NOT looking for a diagnosis or expecting a “magic answer” I’m just looking to compare experiences , familiarities, hear stories etc , to better make sense of my situation. 

Post: 


For the last 6-12 months I have been having lingering depression, which as per my MDD and ASD is not a foreign concept. However this recent period of depression has been without the normal mood components, no suicidal ideation no loss of self worth etc, they are all anhedonia, lethargy and poor self care related + executive dysfunction. I’ve been distancing myself and not wanting any interactions apart from necessary ones (not bizarre given my Autism but it’s more frequent, also could just be burnout).. 

During this time my anxiety has been playing up, when I go to the gym I am paranoid everyone is looking at me and talking about me, staring at me and laughing at me. 

This also happens at work , where I think people are laughing at me, communicating between eachother non verbally and don’t like me. 

At times I also periodically get paranoid my neighbours can see me showering and I sometimes hear noises resembling that thought (window opening, lock noise or a laugh). (Rarely). 

I also get anxious about my air con vent that someone is looking through it (however this was prominent in my teens and was severe so I slept under the blanket for months). 

I have also been noticing more visual illusions, by this I mean in my peripheral vision I sometimes see objects that will periodically take a shape of a person until I look at them centrally and it’s normal. Or sometimes I’ll see floating dots around. (My vision and eye health is fine as per the optometrist) Sometimes I get paranoid I may have seen a human figure too until I look at “them” and it’s nothing or a door for example. (These have been getting more frequent, I’m aware illusions are normal but with their increasing frequency and “severity”)..  they also sometimes take the form of just being shadow spots or a sensation someone has walked behind me.

When walking to my car at night I sometimes get paranoid I’m being followed and sometimes think I hear foot steps following me (assuming this could be an anxiety response). 

Very recently I’ve started laughing out loud to thoughts that come into my head, and sometimes my thoughts just don’t make sense, the other day I made a joke in my mind I was the beacon of truth- that made me laugh out loud lol. (This could also be a self soothing thing with my ASD). 

Further , I’ve been having increasing Deja vu , like every day sometimes multiple times a day. Like a situation or string of words was something that happened before , and preceded a bad event or something bad happening. Almost like a sense of doom but mild.

How was everyone else’s prodrome? Any comparisons/similarities? 

I am aware these symptoms could also overlap with burnout from my ASD, anxiety exacerbating these concerns and my depression being in the background. (? MDD with psychotic features etc). 

I was intrigued at Schizophrenia due to reading a few study’s of the slightly increased % of ASD people in likelihood to develop schizophrenia.

,schizophrenia,"I smoked weed and had a panic attack, it was my first time smoking weed and now I feel afraid and anxious. Right now im 2 months and a half into this but im feeling better after CBT with my psychologist. I was afraid that I died or that Im in coma. I know im dealing with DPDR symptoms.  


But now Im afraid that Im schizo, I dont hear voices or see any delusions, sometimes i see things with faces but that has been always in  my life with random objects or clouds or anything else. but Im just afraid that Im developing schizo or something like that.  


For example i stay in my gamign room and if i hear my family members on the other room talking it feels like there's no one there and it feels like my head makes these voices, even tho the reality is that my family members are in the room and im aware of it but sometimes it feels stupid idk.....  


Sorry if said anything wrong in this feed.
