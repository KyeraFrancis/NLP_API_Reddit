,Army,"You are offered a chance to change MOS. From 9 to 5, you use VR to step into other soldiers bodies, and control them. Your only goal is to make them pass their PT test, and once they pass, you are assigned a new PT failure to train.

* You feel everything they feel (All the pain!), but in real life, you're just sitting in a chair and wiggling around. So in real life, you're burning as much calories as the average gamer, regardless of how out of breath you feel in VR.
* You have a supervisor that watches your VR stream to ensure that you're working the soldier out and not shamming/sharping yourself. You or the soldier can still go to the bathroom privately; if you feel the soldier's urge to tinkle, you simply swap out. The PT Failure's eyes glow green, so everyone knows you're controlling them.
* You do your job at home, virtually. The only thing you pmcs is your headset. There is no other equipment, no uniform, no place of duty, no soldiers under you.
* You are still a soldier, so you still have the most basic responsibilities: Morning PT, medpros, certs, PCS to new units even, but as soon as you get home to do VR, you generally stay home; no COF.
* There is no end of failures to train. You're not expected to be a miracle worker, as you find out that some PT failures are truly hopeless. You also have to do PT tests for these soldiers about twice a week.
* You get lunch from 1130 to 1300.
* You still deploy, but you basically just wiggle for other people in other countries.
* You can rank up just like you normally would.

,Army,"I'm not saying that NCOs need to do full examination of their soldier's credit... but I think they should be talking to them about it! Arguably, one of the best benefits military/vets get is the VA home loan. They don't need perfect credit to capitalize on it, but they still need some credit. 

I had an NCO press me on it when I was a junior enlisted. My thoughts were that he was an old fart that was over stepping. He realized I had very limited knowledge on it and even helped me apply to a credit card that was soley meant for building credit. As a PFC, I was mainly doing it to shut him up. I followed the gameplan and watched my credit score continue to rise. Eventually.. I was able to buy a house with 0 down payment. I'll always be thankful for that NCO.

When I finally became an NCO, I was eager to help my soldiers' credit grow. However, I was always cautious not to overstep. I talked to my soldiers about it over lunch and they were receptive. I didn't discuss it again besides to answer questions. One soldier, about 6 months later, was eager to show me his score increase and referenced our discussion. As I'm reflecting on my time in the army (just ended), this moment became a proud one that I keep coming back to.

Yes. We all get a finance class that skims over the subject. Let's not pretend we've paid attention through every army brief. I don't think NCOs are responsible for every financial decision that their subordinates make. However, the NCOs I surrounded myself with always wanted to make lasting impacts on their soldiers' and battle buddies' lives. This is a very simple way that can turn out to be extremely beneficial. You don't have to do it like I did it. You don't have to do it like my NCO did it. I mean shit..  you don't really have to do it at all. I would just encourage you to do so.

,Army,"I have not been dealing well with Army life as a whole lately and im unsure of what to do. Seeing as im so new to the Army and I havent even made it out of AIT yet I feel like a pussy for even feeling like this. I just dont enjoy anything anymore. Nothing I used to do before makes me happy. I dont feel like im my own person anymore, like Im just kinda watching my own life pass me by helplessly; sometimes I dont even feel like im real. It is extremely difficult for me to unwind at the end of the day because I simply dont have time to waste without sacrificing precious sleep that I already have so little of. And even then, All the time would be spent anxiously worrying about every little thing there is to worry about. Im on edge 24/7 and it fucks with my head so much that I cant concentrate. Im kinda stuck in a weird limbo of fight or flight and its absolute torture; and the worst part is I dont even know why im so on edge. Hell, sometimes its so bad I wake up in the middle of the night in a full blown panic attack for no reason. Sometimes I wake up and my throat is closing up and I cant breathe or my heart is in so much pain I think im dying. Lately, I've begun to have uncontrollable thoughts about suicide and all the ways I could do it. It worries me because I wasnt the kind of person to even think about suicide but now Im afraid one day I just wont be able to take it anymore and I might do it impulsively. But im also afraid that if I reach out for help that it would be a career ender (I probably wouldnt be able to keep my clearance). I've thought about it but I dont wanna go to BH and be ""that guy"". I dont want my leadership to frown upon me for not being able to cope. I dont want to have to fuck over my battle buddies by having to be add a suicide watch on top of the CQ and fireguard shifts that already take countless hours of sleep from them. Whats worse is that my physical conditions are beginning to catch up with me aswell. I have asthma and had a heart surgery for supraventricular tachycardia before joining (I got waivers for both) and its really starting to show during morning PT. I can barely do CD1 without having my heart feeling like its gonna explode and being completely out of breath and wheezing by the end. And thats not even mentioning my knees or my back, I feel like my knee is going to shatter everytime I stand up and my back is so stiff I cant stay in the same position for too long or I wont be able to move. I've thought about all of the ways that I could reach out for help and each one is going to hold me back or get me sent home. I dont have shit except my wife back at home, and she is living at her parents (we dont have our own place). I dont even have a car at home, but at this point I would be more than happy to go back. The reason I left home in the first place was to be able to give us a place to live and money to live on, but is it worth my life?

My question is:

What do I do? do I ask my leadership to just send me tf home so I can atleast get out alive? do I get help and risk losing everything or dragging myself through the mud? do I just tough it out and hope I dont off myself?

Seeing as im so new to the Army and I havent even made it out of AIT yet I feel like a pussy for even feeling like this. I just dont enjoy anything anymore. Nothing I used to do before makes me happy. I dont feel like im my own person anymore, like Im just kinda watching my own life pass me by helplessly; sometimes I dont even feel like im real. It is extremely difficult for me to unwind at the end of the day because I simply dont have time to waste without sacrificing precious sleep that I already have so little of. And even then, All the time would be spent anxiously worrying about every little thing there is to worry about. Im on edge 24/7 and it fucks with my head so much that I cant concentrate. Im kinda stuck in a weird limbo of fight or flight and its absolute torture; and the worst part is I dont even know why im so on edge. Hell, sometimes its so bad I wake up in the middle of the night in a full blown panic attack for no reason. Sometimes I wake up and my throat is closing up and I cant breathe or my heart is in so much pain I think im dying. Lately, I&amp;#39;ve begun to have uncontrollable thoughts about suicide and all the ways I could do it. It worries me because I wasnt the kind of person to even think about suicide but now Im afraid one day I just wont be able to take it anymore and I might do it impulsively. But im also afraid that if I reach out for help that it would be a career ender (I probably wouldnt be able to keep my clearance). I&amp;#39;ve thought about it but I dont wanna go to BH and be &amp;quot;that guy&amp;quot;. I dont want my leadership to frown upon me for not being able to cope. I dont want to have to fuck over my battle buddies by having to be add a suicide watch on top of the CQ and fireguard shifts that already take countless hours of sleep from them. Whats worse is that my physical conditions are beginning to catch up with me aswell. I have asthma and had a heart surgery for supraventricular tachycardia before joining (I got waivers for both) and its really starting to show during morning PT. I can barely do CD1 without having my heart feeling like its gonna explode and being completely out of breath and wheezing by the end.

Its just that the same post keeps getting posted, with the same responses. I don't see how its any different than any other low effort spam post type. (Who knows, maybe I'm guilty of the same thing here)

,Army,"What’s going in BCT and AIT? Do they just not teach discipline and standards anymore? I’m seeing a lot of posts on here about seeing new soldiers or some trainees in the Airport looking like jackasses in uniform. Ive had my experience from this when going home on HBL with people wearing and doing the absolute dumbest shit. It looks incredibly bad on you the individual, the Army, and your drill sergeants when you walk around the airport with headphones and sunglasses while looking down on your phone. Yes, there are the ones and two’s who doe this type of behavior but one solider represents the whole Army so one person doing it is enough to create any sort of problem. 




I mainly blame the drill sergeants for not correcting this type of behavior. As they are their NCOs they should be ensuring this stuff does not happen. I feel like this is an unpopular opinion to blame the drills on trainees behavior but they’re the ones who are tasked to turn civilians into soldiers. They’re your first respreatation of what right should look like and who you’re supposed to look up to. It’s their duty to make sure the uniform is worn with respect and like your proud to be a solider. 




I see a lot of posts also on the marines in uniform in Airport looking sharp and squared away and I have to agree with them. Marines have us beat when it comes to discipline out of basic. 




I’ll take the DFAC Special, please.





__Edit:__ This post has been extremely popular in the last few hours. I received a lot of criticism, some of it was warranted. I honestly got worried at one point that it’d get taken down and I’d get permanently banned from the sub with the amount of shit and downvotes I was getting but I’m glad the mods did not do that. 





Current drill sergeants and senior ranking members all showed me the other side of the spectrum and much shit I don’t know. I will admit I was combative and argumentative in the comments. There’s a lot about being an NCO I don’t know and it was good to have the conversation with everyone about it.

,Army,"I  (19F) will be shipping out to basic training at the end of the month to Fort Jackson, I will be going in as a 12W. I still have a bunch of questions about basic training, if anyone could respond I would be very grateful.

1. What is basic training like for a young female, specifically in Fort Jackson?
2. Do they give you a pack of underwear/ socks or do you have to buy that yourself?
3. What happens if you run out of shampoo/ other hygiene products? Can you request to go to the PX or do you just have to bear with it?
4. I hate styling my hair because it is thick so I'm thinking of cutting it to where I can barley put it in a small ponytail, would that be alright or are there certain hairstyles I have to get?
5. A recruiter told me that the money put in the Eagle Cash card can't be transferred to your credit card after graduating so can I decide how much of my paycheck goes into the card?
6. I want to save as much money from basic training as possible, any tips on how to do that would be great.
7. Do I get to use my phone when calling my family or is there a specific phone in the barracks that I have to use?

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is basic training like for a young female, specifically in Fort Jackson?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do they give you a pack of underwear/ socks or do you have to buy that yourself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if you run out of shampoo/ other hygiene products? Can you request to go to the PX or do you just have to bear with it?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A recruiter told me that the money put in the Eagle Cash card can&amp;#39;t be transferred to your credit card after graduating so can I decide how much of my paycheck goes into the card?&lt;/li&gt;

,Army,"Hello Army community,

&amp;#x200B;

This is one of my first posts to the Army community, reddit in general. 

I'm a young, age 24, single, newly promoted E-5 with plans on re-enlisting for a 4-year contract. (I have about a year left of my current contract.)

My current MOS is a 12R (Interior Electrician). 

&amp;#x200B;

This is going to be super transparent.

I spent my first couple years out of high school in college, made more mistakes than I thought were possible, and dropped out with 73 credit hours towards a business degree at a hefty price of $22,000 of Debt.

My original plan coming into the Army was to change my status from a liability to and asset (get out of debt and learn a skill), use my experience from my MOS to get into an IBEW Journeyman electrician apprenticeship program, and to leave with an honorable discharge. More general context, I wanted to build and have the opportunity to continuously build value in character I'm becoming, and I was in an environment that was killing that growth. (My first priority = The character I'm becoming)

Currently, 2 out of 3 of the goals are going according to plan. I've brought my debt from $22,000 to \~$12,000 with estimated date of completion no later than October of this year and have been keeping my nose clean. My goal of transferring my experience from my MOS to the civilian world is astray. First, the only time I've done my job was for our 6-week AIT (Little / no experience). Second, I've got a really bad taste in my mouth of what it means to be an ""Electrician"". More so, I look at myself in the mirror and feel like I haven't completed what I came in for, for lack of better words. 

I'm currently attached to unit specialized in dealing with high voltage electricity, MOS is 12P, and hate the working environment. Everyone is in there 30's or up, everyone is married, PT is a last priority, low reward for competition, extremely slow working tempo, and there is limited opportunity of growth other than what is in the scope of pursuing an MOS to 12P. I'm urgently planning on getting out of the unit ASAP.  

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly needed to get that out and put it out into the world. 

Build again and construct a new plan. 

Maybe some of you can relate.

&amp;#x200B;

I was recently given some advice / encouragement from my leadership that I should consider getting my education as a plan #2 in case the Army doesn't work out. I'm reluctant to start talking classes. Quite honestly, I'm scared. 

I've done some research and have taken some interest in a BA of Economics with future looks of double majoring in Stats.

,Army,"15D aircraft power train repairer. SPC, been in 5 years and 7ish months. I’ve only got 5 months left in the army and my unit pushed for a BLC slot.

I know my job in and out, have awards for outstanding maintenance and performance. But being an NCO is too much.

Are there any ways to get out of the course without getting barred or flagged? Any ways to avoid a bar or flag if I do fail the course? Any way to do a CSP even if I’m barred or flagged?

&gt;***Niall Ferguson on the importance of contemplating defeat in Cold War II:***   
&gt;  
&gt;I think that there’s a decent chance we’ll lose Cold War II. And that’s what people find really hard to visualize. The reason people don’t worry is that they kind of think, “We’re always going to win. It’s going to be fine. Don’t worry.” And I’m like, no, you have to contemplate the possibility of losing. The United States did not inevitably win Cold War I. It looked like it was losing for most of the 1970s. By 1979, it really looked like it was in trouble. And I think we just don’t get across to people what losing might be like and why it might be bad.   
&gt;  
&gt;Ukrainians understand what losing is like because they saw Bucha. They saw the bodies in the streets of Bucha. Israelis know what losing is like because they know that October 7 was a dress rehearsal for the Holocaust II. But we don’t really know what losing would mean. And young Americans absolutely have no concept. In fact, young Americans are so complacent about freedom that they’re basically against it now, which is a bizarre turn of events.   
&gt;  
&gt;We need a bit more of what we would actually be like if we lost. Let’s just imagine that there is a Taiwan crisis and they send two aircraft carrier groups, and the Chinese just sink both the carriers, and the U.S. finds it has to sue for peace, and Taiwan is taken over, and Xi Jinping does the ticker-tape parade through Taipei. What then? What does that mean? I think a lot of people haven’t really got anywhere close to thinking that through.   
&gt;  
&gt;They don’t realize that ceasing to be number one, losing the Pax Americana, has massive costs. These are the things people don’t spend enough time thinking about because they just complacently assume that somehow all of this stuff is going on over there in Ukraine and Israel and Taiwan, and somehow we’ll be fine. But the reality is we will definitely not be fine any more than we would have been fine if the Soviets had won the first Cold War.

I would of course like to first state that I'm only a civilian, who's closest experience to anything Marine Corps is MCJROTC (go ahead and make all the jokes you want). Additionally I do a impressions of a late 1980 to early 1990s USMC Infantrymen, so I atleast have a ( basic) understanding when it comes to dealing with shining Jungle Boots, dealing with Alice Gear (and the inability to sit comfortably in a vehicle with a Buttpack in), wearing a PASGT helmet and vest...etc 


With that out the way, I would like to hear about your folks experience when it comes to equipment loadouts when it comes to field exercises..etc. 

For starters, I've seen images with Infantry with M40 Gas Mask carriers in the field (outside of desert storm). I presume that was likely a required piece of equipment, but did any of you ever sham your way out of bringing it along? 

What about GeDunk and Pogey bait? Was it common to bring some some along, and if so what did you bring? 

How did you set up and utilize your Alice webbing and pack? Did you have dump pouches for empty rifle magazines? What did you bring along in your Buttpack if you used one? 

What about personnel hygiene dealing with personal hygiene in the field? As it wasn't till the 1980s that baby wipes really became widespread. Did you or anyone bring baby wipes along into the field with you?

The reasons for this is because:

,USMC,"Hi all, this is my first time posting here

I’ve had back pain since MCT, for a short summary, before I joined the military I was diagnosed with scoliosis. Doctors said it developed as I got older, at the time they said it was a mild curve. I enlisted in the military after spending a year in the DEP, MEPS noted the spine but went “eh” and still passed me through. Went to bootcamp a year later in January of 2023 when I was of age, suffered during the hikes because of my back but pushed through it since the whole “if you go the medical we will drop you”, went to MCT in May, during the final hike I felt something just immediately hurt on my ride side and lasted over 2 months during the schoolhouse. Over time it went from hella hurting to mangeable. I hit the fleet in September, because my regiment was moving around units and that I had a gym injury that lasted 3-ish weeks I never rucked anywhere so it allowed my back to not get that bad like during the summer. Fast forward to Christmas leave, I’m messing around with my friends and injure my back to the point where it felt like back in May - absolutely painful. I took pain killers (spare Motrin from a gym injury in September) to no avail. I get back this Tuesday at 2AM, yesterday I get off at like 12 since half the units on leave still. Writhing in pain still so I go to my personal trainer after work - they’re closed. I go to medical - we have an appointment for you on the 11th. Then today, I get a call from my lieutenant he asks if I’m light duty, and I tell him no but- “hey we’re short a RO so you’re going to itx in a week, you’ll be there for 5 weeks to 10 weeks”. I told him I’ve been trying to see the naval doctor here to see my back and the personal trainer since it’s been hurting horribly. He asks if I have paperwork, and I say I’m going to medical to get it. Medical refers me to PT, the PT says my spine looks absolutely curved. Like, severe was her words under her breath before she corrected herself so I wouldn’t panic or whatever. She does the whole evaluation, everything hurts and she notes it and says I need to set an appointment with an MO. I go back to medical, they say I can go to sick call tomorrow morning at 8:30 and they’ll move the appointment to… the 10th.  So I don’t know what’ll happen if I get light duty, but my Cpl later today tells me that “command decides, even if you get light duty medical has no say around here, command does”.

Idk wtf is going on but I’m gonna be so salty if I don’t pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubt anyone else is having this exact issue but if you are any advice would be great. Tbh I feel like if mol says I’m selected, I’m gonna get promoted. But who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maradmin 631/23 for reference&lt;/p&gt;

,USMC,"&gt;The Justice Department announced \[26dec23\] that is has secured a settlement against Billy Joe Goines, owner and operator of Goines Towing &amp; Recovery, based near Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, to resolve allegations that he violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) by towing and then selling vehicles without disclosing to the court that they were owned by servicemembers. \*\*\*  
&gt;  
&gt;In a complaint filed on March 3, the United States alleged that Goines auctioned off, sold or otherwise disposed of motor vehicles owned by eight servicemembers in violation of the SCRA, which provides a wide variety of financial and housing protections to members of the military. The SCRA requires a towing company to file an accurate affidavit stating whether the vehicle’s owner is in military service (i.e. a military affidavit) before it can get a court judgment authorizing it to sell a stored vehicle. If it appears that a vehicle’s owner is in military service, the court may not authorize the sale of the vehicle until it appoints an attorney to represent the interests of the servicemember. If that attorney then requests a postponement of the matter, the court must grant that request and postpone the case for at least 90 days.  The complaint here alleges that Goines either failed to file or filed inaccurate military affidavits with the court. Goines also allegedly filed military affidavits stating that he was unable to tell whether a vehicle owner was in the military even in instances where the vehicle at issue was towed from a military installation or had military decals, and instances when the vehicle owner or owner’s spouse had informed Goines of the owner’s active military service.\*\*\* [https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-north-carolina-based-towing-company-resolve-violations](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-north-carolina-based-towing-company-resolve-violations)

,USMC,"I was FAP'd out to the MPs at Cherry Point in 1998. One night one of my shift mates took me out to the grave site close to the PFT route across the road from the end of a flight line (if my memory is correct). A few of the 8 or 10 graves had the last name Buys which is an alternate spelling of my name Buijs. I always assumed they were distant relatives of my mom's family from her small town in the Netherlands.   
I just googled the graves and found out the eldest of the deceased was indeed born in the Netherlands.  Her married name  Brandt is the same as an uncle who married an aunt of mine - so possibly related on that side too.

One night one of my shift mates took me out to the grave site close to the PFT route across the road from the end of a flight line (if my memory is correct). A few of the 8 or 10 graves had the last name Buys which is an alternate spelling of my name Buijs. I always assumed they were distant relatives of my mom&amp;#39;s family from her small town in the Netherlands.&lt;br/&gt;
I just googled the graves and found out the eldest of the deceased was indeed born in the Netherlands.  Her married name  Brandt is the same as an uncle who married an aunt of mine - so possibly related on that side too.&lt;br/&gt;

,bipolar,"Okay, just to reassure everybody, I truly don't mean to start any battles here haha. We're all in this together, and our symptoms are more similar than different! This is in no way some silly argument about ""which is worse"" or an attempt to pit us against each other. But one thing I see referred to a lot is the idea that bipolar 2 ""has worse depressions"" than bipolar 1, which a lot of folks seem to interpret as *more severe* depressions, and I want to just gently posit that this idea needs to be teased out a bit more than I usually see it spoken about. 

I spend a lot of time on pubmed for research purposes, and most of the stuff I've seen has said that depression in bp2 tends to (emphasis on *tends* to!) last longer and be more frequent--and I'm absolutely on board in terms of why that could be considered ""worse"" or more disabling on the depressive end of things, for sure. But as far as I can tell, based on the research, the actual *severity* of the depression is not different between the two diagnoses. Similarly, we both have the same rate of suicide. And for every study I've seen that does find that depression in bp2 *is* more severe, there's another that finds the opposite ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-01146-0](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-01146-0) like this one, for example), which kind of tells you we're at least neck and neck (again, in terms of severity, not necessarily length or quantity), or that it's not as cut-and-dry as all that haha.

But I think probably more important to keep in mind than anything the research says about trends (emphasis on trends), is that this illness is a spectrum, and an individual's symptoms can't be captured solely by 1 vs 2 (vs cyclothymia, vs nos, etc). There will be those among us with bp1 who have had only one episode of mania, never any hypomania, and who have *incredibly* severe and frequent long-lasting depressions, and conversely those with bp2 who trend more toward serious and painful hypomanias, and only have had one 2-week episode of severe depression. 

I myself (I'm diagnosed with bp1) certainly have had my share of hypomania and psychotic mania, but I've also had depressions lasting years, psychotic depressions, catatonic depressions, suicide attempts. My depression is utterly disabling. On the other hand I also *tend* to--on medication, anyway--only have one depressive episode a year or so, and usually it's more along the lines of 1-4 months, plus my baseline is pretty upbeat and bubbly-happy, which certainly mimics the typical bp1 course of illness more, afaik! Like I said, it's all a spectrum.

I guess maybe I've just been feeling a bit uncomfortable with (what seems to be, based on my research) the misleading way we talk about this topic, as well as feeling a bit dismissed by some of the language used to differentiate our experiences, which *can* be different, but aren't always, and not always in the same way. In the same way that it's important for us all not to diminish the pain that hypomania can cause, I think it's equally important to not dismiss the experiences of depression in bp1 sufferers. I hope that all makes sense and doesn't raise anybody's hackles! This is just about acknowledging our similarities and making an effort to make room for all of the different experiences that bipolar can give us, regardless of diagnosis, not about diminishing anybody's experience!

,bipolar,"Hey everyone!

We wanted to announce our changes for 2024 and some general housekeeping stuff.

# Rules

We have decided to refine our rules to remove any ambiguities in the past as we move forward in 2024.

In order, we have the following:

**Rule 1:** **Friends/Family/Medical Professionals**

* This is still a Peer-Support community.
   * Non-peer users will now receive 1 warning for posting in r/bipolar
      * If a warned user continues to post/comment, they will be permanently banned

   Note: Users may appeal this ban, but the ban will stand if they are not a peer.  

**Rule 2:** **Asking for Diagnosis/Diagnosing**

* Med Reviews. We are working on another write-up for this to make the guidelines clear to everyone. Until we can do so, please refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/151mcog/regarding_questions_about_medications/)

**Rule 3: Discouraging Professional Treatment**

* No changes here.

**Rule 4: Civility**

* Highlighting that this also applies to modmail.

**Rule 5-12**

* No Changes to these rules. 

**Rule 13: Use Search/Mega Thread/ Theme Day**

* Update on what the Theme Days are. Please continue to use the search function and the links on the sidebar for popular community topics; this makes it easier for someone to find the most relevant information to their question in the future.
   * Use Search/Mega Thread/Theme Days:
      * Use the search/sidebar links for frequent topics
      * Active Community Discussions (On Going)
         * To be posted the first week of the month.
      * Manic Monday
      * Weekly Music Thread
      * Wellness Wednesday
      * Feel Good Friday
         * Includes standalone memes, non-original art, and infographic posts.

**Rule 14: General Guidelines**

* The catch-all...sadly...
   * Limiting post/comment length to 3500 characters
      * Posts/Comments over 2000 characters will be reviewed by the moderation team
      * Enforcing line breaks on longer posts.
         * When using Reddit on a desktop, users will receive a notification and be prevented from submitting until line breaks are added
         * For mobile, users will receive a message from AutoMod requesting that line breaks be added to the post. 

**Rule 15: Counter-Moderation**

* Any attempts to deliberately counteract the actions of the moderation team may result in a ban. Includes (but is not limited to) reposting removed content, attempting to circumvent AutoModerator or other moderation mechanisms, and using non-standard characters to try to get around Automod.
* Please don't DM the Mods individually about the community.
   * Send Modmail or use the Suggestion Jar for moderation matters.

# Our Discord server

* We are looking for users to help us moderate so that we can open our server. If you are interested [let us know](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdafn2hn8wPuEqNxsjyzoMtr0g9Rw69shSTr_E1S7iY46iRLw/viewform)

,bipolar,"Hello! I hope this isn't too against the rules... I am diagnosed Bipolar I and medicated. It runs in my family, but not everyone is diagnosed.

My sister has been diagnosed with depression in the past and she's on antidepressants. She just had a baby a couple months ago and a few days ago she entered a really intense state of what seems to be psychosis... She's having the ""I believe in God now and I'm gonna save the world"" delusions and all that... I have my ideas for what's going on don't want to speculate too much, especially not here, because I think it's against the rules...

What I do need advice on is how we can get her admitted. Her husband took her to urgent care and she actually ended up having to be sedated. She had COVID weeks ago and her symptoms have come and gone, but she's still testing positive. No one will take her because a lot of the evaluation is in a group setting, but she REALLY needs this psych evaluation. She's in the hospital now which is good because she is safer there, but she has a baby at home who misses *both* of his parents and I'm just starting to feel so hopeless. This COVID roadblock is making me feel like she might not actually get the help she needs any time soon and because of her behavior, I just can't believe that there doesn't seem to be any alternative... They're just allowing her to remain in this clearly concerning mental state.

When I was admitted (involuntarily) maybe 10 years ago, a psychiatrist came to my room before I was admitted. I got a more thorough evaluation after actually being admitted. I know it's entitled for me to suggest anything outside their protocol, but I just wish they could get a psychiatrist to come into her hospital room and do a more thorough evaluation...

It&amp;#39;s like I don&amp;#39;t feel close to other people. I know that for 1 2 years we couldn&amp;#39;t be together anyway but I can&amp;#39;t stop fantasizing about us being together one day. And I know that is probably better to date someone stable strong and patient, so probably &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; but I&amp;#39;ve tried that and it just feels forced and fake. I was ok with being alone before him but now it&amp;#39;s like something is missing. Also now that I&amp;#39;ve realised all that I feel lost, I&amp;#39;m not sure if I feel like that because I&amp;#39;m 25 or this is the hard reality. It&amp;#39;s hard to find the motivation to do anything. I got diagnosed only recently and I still have a lot to learn together with my psychotherapist.&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"    Hello everyone, 

    I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar 1 for over ten years. Wasn’t all too bad at the beginning, but I never really did anything about it and it all came to a head a few years ago when I finally got clean and sober, after over ten years of active addiction. I was no longer able to run away from my problems, numb the feelings I didn’t want to feel and had to actually face the reality of my disorder and mental health in general. 
    
    It’s been a long journey. I’ve lose a lot of friends, burnt all my employment bridges, destroyed family ties and dwelled in so much self pity. But I’m here today to say that I’m alive and I’m more optimistic about my future at my age of 31 than I was at 21. I hope this feeling lasts as long as it can, because moments like these are usually followed up by a feeling of dread. It can be scary and confusing at times, but I promised myself to fight through it. 
    
    Getting back on medication was the hardest part for me, because I’m still an addict and I need instant ratification and results, patience isn’t my strong suit. But I made the call and I actually can’t wait to start this new journey of mine. I don’t really want to give out too much information about myself, over sharing is something I’m struggling with. But I will say that I have someone in my life that is very special to me and I want to be able to give her the best version of myself. I want to give myself a fighting chance for once.
    
    For those whom think it’s too late for them or always giving up on themselves. Please hang in there, cherish the good times and hold onto that feeling for as long as you can. Store that happy memory for when you need it and remember to keep pushing. You’re right where you need to be. Humble yourself instead of punishing yourself.

,bipolar,"Just a quick venting moment (prior to what I’m saying, I have BP1, among other things): this shouldn’t annoy me, but it’s one of the only things that annoys me anymore. The amount of posts about bipolar 1 &amp; 2 (and things said outside of here and everywhere else) and then people saying others don’t understand or try to understand it and then post inaccurate information about it on here/elsewhere. Some of the simple facts about bipolar I see are phrased incorrectly on here all the time. For example (and this is the correct fact, but people say these incorrectly all the time): 

- bipolar 2 requires at least 1 depressive state and one hypomanic state. 
- bipolar 1 does not require a depressive state, but it can occur, and requires at least one manic state. 
- hypomania and mania can occur in bipolar 1, but mania cannot occur in bipolar 2, only hypomania. 
- although both affect people differently, mania is considered the more severe form and hypomania is not considered as severe as a manic episode.
- depression does not have mania or hypomania. 
- bipolar depression is its own thing and it cannot be diagnosed with major depressive disorder, each is its own, separate, diagnosis.  
- hypomania and mania can only be recognized as such if 3 of the symptoms occur at the same time. 

I want people to be educated on it too, and understand some actions that may occur for everyone’s sake that has either of them, but you can’t expect people to always understand when they may be reading inaccurate info.

,bipolar,"Hi all,

I am posting because I think I may be hypomanic but this is the first time i'm recognizing the symptoms and being self aware if that makes sense. 

A little background, i was diagnosed bipolar 2 in college 2 years ago. Bipolar runs in my family so I think that makes me more predisposed? 

I didn't really think i had bipolar cause I only had one hypomanic episode 2 years ago when i switched my SSTI and didn't think id have one again and thought it was induced by the medicine. I was depressed from aug 2022-march 2023 as i moved super far and started my first job out of college. I have been stable since April 2023 with only smaller bouts of depression that I have learned how to pull myself out of very quickly. I just thought bipolar 2 was a misdiagnosis of true depression. 

I stopped taking my lamictal in fevruary when i felt i didnt need it. I started Luvox 50mg 2 months ago for anxiety and skin picking. 

Anyways, i went home for christmas and just flew back. The night I flew back and got to my apartment, i had this great career epiphany of what i want to do longterm, get my masters in a completely different field and open a business. I paced around my kitchen island talking to myself about this idea for over an hour. I suddenly stopped pacing and realized that maybe pacing around talking to yourself isn't normal, especially since I was also feeling super energized, jittery, and my mind couldnt focus on a single thought it was racing. I cant explain it but my body felt like it has a motor or hum if that makes sense. I picked my boyfriend up from the airport after that and had to wait for him to grt his liggage for 20 minutes. I got soo mad at him and almost started crying, which id a vast overreaction than i usually have. 

This happened 1-1-24 and i still have symptoms today 1-5-2024. The continued symptoms are:

It is a very busy werk at work, i have been working 12 hour days since monday, cooking meals every night, walking my dog 5 miles a day, as well as training her to hold a dumbell, and only getting 4 hours of sleep. I have not taken my aderral all week and i usually need at least a couple days a week to stay focused but i have so much energy to get things done with such little sleep. 

Im kind of having an epiphany/self reflection moment that maybe i really do have bipolar after all. I am still really amped up but am realizing that ai think i have felt this before and not recognized that i really could be hypomanic. 

I am very good at managing my moods so am not super concerned but im having an ethical dilemma where i dont really want this feeling to go away as i feel really good and productive and confident. Another weird thing is that i feel like if i really wanted to i could come down and almost control the hypomania. 

However, now that ive become self aware im nervous that this could get worse in The future or what will happen when i come down. I really dont want to get back on medication.

I don&amp;#39;t perform how I know I could socially. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if a lot of the thoughts and difficulties are because of the illness or because of something else. Maybe I&amp;#39;m trying too hard to fix something that I can&amp;#39;t fix myself, and it shouldn&amp;#39;t be this hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m considering maybe being medicated just for a bit, maybe a year to see what happens? 
I&amp;#39;m 
1. Afraid that something in my brain will flip forever, something I won&amp;#39;t be able to get back. 
2. I greatly dislike the idea of being dependent on society to this extent due to never really being accepted by it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are these worries unfounded? What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"I am a 25F. I have struggled with depression, my entire life. I finally reached out for help about two years ago now. I was originally diagnosed with depression, anxiety, insomnia and OCD. My psychiatrist had prescribed me Prozac, Vitamin D, Wellbutrin and Trazondone. In September 2023 I felt like I was doing really good mentally. I seriously felt happiness unlike anything I’ve felt before. I slowly stopped taking all my medication except for trazodone (My family all makes fun of me and shames me for being on it and looking back I should have never listened but I did and decided to get off it all) I was feeling really good mentally after stopping though.

 Fast forward to January 2024 I finally decided to focus on my mental health journey more and make sure I take care of myself so I dont take steps back. I wanted to tackle my anxiety so I took my Wellbutrin and Prozac that I had on my dresser and 2 days later I felt horrible. I had severe suicidal thoughts and felt like a failure. I called a close friend because I was so scared. I hadn’t felt those feelings in months and suddenly I felt like I was back to square one.

Opportunities to talk to my friends have become few and far between, and Xbox is really the only place I get to talk to them. I noticed that two of them were online and in a party, and I got really excited as I haven't talked to them in a while, and it's even more rare that they're both online.

Well, once I saw that there were other people in the party, I just froze. They actually made friends in college. They have lives. They're real people. I sat there for TEN FUCKING MINUTES trying to build up the courage to join the party before just turning my Xbox off.

I've been in such a good mood for the past month or so despite the looming prospect of starting college again on Monday. I even told my therapist today that I felt that, while I certainly wouldn't be initiating any conversations, that I was confident that I could talk to people if spoken to.

Clearly that is not the case. If I can't even join a party with strangers that I can't even see, then I'm clearly not going to be able to speak to anyone, and will remain unable to make friends or even aquaintances.

I just feel so pathetic. This will be my fifth attempt at going back to school. I don't have much left on my degree, and I'm not really worried about finishing. It just sucks to know that I'll do so completely alone. Again.

Like I said, I've been in such a good mood lately, and now I am absolutely horribly depressed. The fact that I couldn't even muster up the courage to join the party completely crushed me. I've rarely felt more like a fucking loser.

,bipolar,"Over the summer I was using cannabis heavily and it turns out, was manic, was probably manic for a really long time from a combo of using cannabis and only being on anti-depressants. A full on psychotic break in the fall made it obvious that there was something greater going on with my mental health and I got diagnosed with Bipolar.

&amp;#x200B;

They put me on Geodon 40mg and my mother says its like I'm suddenly normal. I actually decided to quit Cannabis of my own accord because I could feel its interaction with the anti psychotic making it less effective.

&amp;#x200B;

As I become stable and treated I'm having a hard time coping though. Like I maybe want to deny that I'm like this, or maybe want to go back to the way things used to be. I miss that manic feeling of everything being meaningful and life being so vivid.

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely cycled to a depressive phase and its been really hard. They upped my geodon to 60 mg to help this and that feels like its given a ""floor"" to my depression but I'm still having trouble feeling motivated or ""ok"" most days. Not to mention the fatigue, which I'm reading may get better as I adjust but lord its hard to get out of bed right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Does it get better? I go back and forth a lot on whether I really ""need"" the meds or not, but the fact I am no longer thinking psychotic flavored thoughts like everything being some personal omen to me, or that people are liable to gang stalk me, speaks to the fact I needed this. I also remember having a psychotic break at 16, unrelated to weed use, which would indicate that it wasn't just weed flavored psychosis.

&amp;#x200B;

tw: drugs mention, suicide mention

my moods have been so unhinged lately despite appearing normal from the outside, i have started 3 bullet journals, a tarot tracker, learning 2 languages, and go to the gym for 1+ hr everyday (more than usual). yet despite all these “manic” behaviors, i feel like garbage and have no motivation to actually complete any regular tasks in my day to day life. i feel so utterly alone with how i feel, people only understand depression.

my psychiatrist prescribed me wellbutrin and i started it today to help with my motivation problems. i am an anxious mess wondering if the side effects will send me over the edge because of how weird and dysphoric i have felt. i have a history of akathisia from abilify.

,bipolar,"I’ve been seeing a therapist for 4+ years now. I shouldn’t allow myself to be influenced but - a lot of people in my circle - albeit unsupportive people who also doubt my diagnosis - are encouraging me to stop therapy or cut back and be more “independent” and resilient. One person went so far as to say “grow up and stop all treatment; you’re not sick.” 

Just typing this out feels like I know my answer as to whether or not stopping is right for me BUT… 

Has anyone reached stability where they would and have safely quit weekly therapy sessions?? 

Due to my codependent nature, I get why some people are concerned about my enmeshment with my therapist and how long the relationship can endure and be mutually beneficial.

But also, therapy has helped me grow and stop a lot of toxic relationships and workplaces over time, and of course it’s now time to address the abusive family system. Pulling away from my only consistent person feels really terrifying.

EDIT: Thanks so much for being supportive and affirming. I think these family members trying to influence me have good intentions but are clueless about my condition or how I feel because they’ve never bothered to actually ask me. 

I finalized a divorce last year and everyone wants me to be happy and moving on and dating and advancing my career. They don’t understand what it’s like to lose cognitive ability, to be faking it at work because you truly can’t remember a number sequence when doing data entry. 

It’s super hard to distance myself from my family; I lost most of my deep friendships in the toxic marriage and it’s hard to start over in every aspect of your life, as we all know.  

Again, thank you. 🙏

,bipolar,"As a 44 year old white guy married with 2 kids who has had bipolar all his life, this past few months I have been neck deep in some of the worst depression I've had in my life, in so much that its not necessarily a product of manic depression (but it is, but I've been far worse conditions due to delusions and mania coupled with the depression.  But this is just pure depression it seems.  I feel like such an asshole because I can't feel happiness with my kid.  My family has no idea what I'm going through and I certainly don't want them to know.  I smile at my kids and maintain status quo but inside I feel nothing and am even more depressed that I can't get joy from simply being a good father.  I feel like I have pretty much spent my life up already.  There's not going to be good years ahead in so much as they were already in the past.  I feel older, my body's older, its not in the same shape as it used to be and I'm deteriorating.  Some people have it much worse than me, and I don't know how they get through the day.  I feel I am spoiled, which is why I'm depressed about crap that genuinely physically unhealthy people deal with every day but seem to just brush it off.    


Anyways, time goes by so slowly throughout the day.  It was a few months ago that I loved my job, was kicking all sorts of ass with it.  It was all due to my mania I had over the summer.  Now its over and the opposite is kicked in and I can't stand my job anymore.  Its changed, its my perception, and its my disorder.  I can't stand doing much anything anymore.  Its all so trite and meaningless it seems.  The whole everything, work every day to pay bills that will allow me to get to work every day and take care of my family.  Yes I know I need to keep going for them, but then again I feel I am a fraud.  Do I feel anything anymore?  I don't think I've been a good dad recently, a good anything recently.  I'm filled with suffering, suffering through each second with death or disappearing from everything would be so much better than enduring this constant distaste for life.    


I try to play guitar and thats fine but its also work, hard work.  I'm lacking motiviation.  I still do my job.  I just want to lay in bed and look at nothing until a fall asleep and temporarily seem to stop existing.  I don't enjoy anything the way I used to and its taking its toll on me.  I've had so many interests in my life, so many promises, so much potential, so much enthusiasm, and now its gone.  Just like you guys I struggle every day right now.  I want to go up to my coworkers and ask them what they fuck gets them through the day to get through this bullshit society day in and day out, but it won't matter.  They play their video games, they have their family, they have their forms of self improvement.  I have mine, but it doesn't even matter, what for?   Perhaps I'm in a midlife existential crisis.  I don't want to get older.  Don't have much of a choice.  I Feel trapped. Wondering how long this episode will last?  Can't shake this mood I'm in and the mood I'm in is backed up by real logical existential philosophy too that goes through my head regularly now.  Sure, I'm put on a good show, but nobody really gets what's going on inside my head.  If they did, they wouldn't like it either.

I've never had a lot of free time to just explore or even develop my interests. Previously, they were things I could do in a weekend after working -- watching TV, an occasional movie outing. Very basic. I love cooking but since I'm single with no kids, how much cooking can a girl do?

**Now that I'm on disability, I have the time to focus on me** and I'm having a hard time figuring out what I like. I'd like to expand my social circle now that my medication is working and I'm feeling better than I used to. 

**My local library has monthly events that I enjoy.** Sometimes it's a discussion about a movie (usually movies I've never seen or considered watching, which is a good thing), other times it's an art exhibit. **I'd love to play backgammon with people in person instead of only online.** This I really love; play at least once a day on my iPad.

,bipolar,"Hi all,

I was diagnosed with bipolar II in June 2023. Took about 15 years to get an accurate diagnosis. I'm still learning how to handle the highs and lows. I had a good 3 months of stable mood but recently had a hypomanic episode and now I'm in a low. It's not a severe low, but I can't seem to get myself to do anything at work. The last 3 months I've been working great and feeling good, so it's a huge bummer to be back to doing nothing. 

My question is, how do you all deal with your symptoms at work? Do you push through the days until you feel better, or do you take sick time? I'm at a point where I'm not accomplishing anything at work, but I feel guilty taking time off. At the same time, I feel guilty sitting here not doing much.

,bipolar,"Still waiting for my new insurance to kick in so that I get in with a psychiatrist and get meds. I was diagnosed bipolar almost two years ago but lost insurance shortly afterwards. So I’m not sure which type I am. But from the research I’ve done it seems like I tend to have a lot of mixed episodes and/or rapid cycling. I think I stay in a state of mixed episodes a majority of the time though. I’ll have all the energy, anxiety, irritability, etc. that comes with hypomania, mixed with the depressive symptoms. But at least once or twice a month I have like a total mental breakdown where I go into like this fit of rage and uncontrollable crying and screaming and feeling suicidal and having racing thoughts all at once. Sometimes these outbursts last a few hours and it’s pure misery. It’s like I can’t get my brain to slow down or shut up and it makes me want to pull my hair out. And for hours I won’t be able to calm down… I have some questions. First, Can anyone else describe their experience with mixed  episodes?

I was diagnosed bipolar almost two years ago but lost insurance shortly afterwards. So I’m not sure which type I am. But from the research I’ve done it seems like I tend to have a lot of mixed episodes and/or rapid cycling. I think I stay in a state of mixed episodes a majority of the time though. I’ll have all the energy, anxiety, irritability, etc. that comes with hypomania, mixed with the depressive symptoms. But at least once or twice a month I have like a total mental breakdown where I go into like this fit of rage and uncontrollable crying and screaming and feeling suicidal and having racing thoughts all at once. Sometimes these outbursts last a few hours and it’s pure misery. It’s like I can’t get my brain to slow down or shut up and it makes me want to pull my hair out. And for hours I won’t be able to calm down… I have some questions. First, Can anyone else describe their experience with mixed  episodes?

***this post might be all over the place because of how my brain runs lol***
I’ve recently started to spiral into a manic episode due to my stressful job. Few important notes, I’m not medicated for my bipolar, only for my adhd and my stressful job is serving at a very very high volume sports venue/restaurant.
Alright so, I was diagnosed bipolar while I was a teenager- I was probably 16 yrs old. I’m now 28. It does run in the family. I have in the past been prescribed meds but at the time didn’t like how they made me feel or they just didn’t seem to work. I’ve been on vyvanse for my adhd for about 5 years now and honestly I think it helps a lot with my impulse control when it comes to decision making and keeping me goal oriented, which does wonders for me bc I need structure, as do most of us who struggle with bipolar. Does anyone have any helpful tips or tricks on how to manage their emotions naturally during a manic episode? I’ve kind of just been raw dogging this illness (by choice) but am losing my grip/footing on how to keep the drastic emotions in check at times. I as a person can pick up on things that trigger my anxiety &amp; mania and know when an episode is coming on and I know rationally that my thinking and emotions are distorted, but I just wanna hear other ways people combat their ups and downs on their own.

And yes I know therapy and medication will do me wonders, I’m getting there..I get anxiety when it comes to sitting down and selecting the right therapist and then having to find time in my chaotic and constantly changing work schedule. And maybe I’m dragging my feet and making excuses bc it’s easier than leaving my comfort zone and taking the leap or getting help.

,bipolar,"may contain trigger warnings like religious traumas,,, ig

I'm Southeast Asian, and a lot of SEA parents have ample to no knowledge about dealing with mental health at all. My mom is one of those people who would believe in voodoo and also be a roman catholic at the same time. She's also old enough to be fooled by those ""cure all"" medicines and ointments, and I'm the very opposite of her (considering that she's in her 60s and I'm in my early 20s), whereas I would hyper-fixate on researching about important stuff (to me, at least). 

Long story short, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder I, after missing my long term quiz, and ultimately found a doctor to give me a medical certificate, and prescriptions. She's not very familiar with the term and she had been viewing me as someone who was rude and moody, not until my diagnosis. 

It was very endearing that she was worrying about me at first. I got to tell her that it had been really long since I was feeling this way (u know,,, depresso and mania) and it wasn't just a one time thing. I was suffering silently ever since highschool and I'm aware of that (I'm in college now). And I was scared to let her know about this because I KNOW she won't take it very well and I KNOW that she's going to try various unresearched thing that claims to ""cure"" people of their said illness. The first few days, she had been following exactly what my doctor told us. NOT UNTIL she contacted her **Dentist** (in bold to emphasize the ridiculousness of the situation) who she claims to know more than what their doctorate degree indicates. She basically booked an appointment with that dentist for me. 

The Dentist made this ""Healing"" Therapy with me (which costs just as much as a real therapy) . Upon seeing their office and clinic, it was clear that they're also very religious given the amount of Jesus-es I've seen. Don't get me wrong, I'd rather let my mom take me to a church and ask the priest to exorcise the hell out of my depression than this weird dentist thing, disinforming my mom about mental health and medications - which, given my luck, didn't happen. 

My mom now believes that everything that my Psych doctor told me is a scheme, intentionally making their patients worse so they could come back to them. I think it's ridiculous that she finds that healing therapy stuff more helpful than a doctor with years of expertise with this stuff, ALL because this weirdass dentist discredited psychiatrists. (TW: &gt;!They basically claimed that my anti-psychotics would make me depend on it and make me feel a lot worse. She then referred to hollywood artists committing s-word because of ""good ol western medicine""!&lt;)

My mom, in turn, made me stop taking my meds (anti-psychotics) and this had made me go back to not sleeping on time with racing thoughts as usual. She's planning to book another appointment with this mojo dentist. This has been making my mental health spiral down again seeing that we're also struggling with money, yet she's choosing to make me go to this clown. She's eager to make me go because she apparently was promised that my mood disorder would go away in a few sessions. 

I'd rather let her take me to go seek Jesus in my life with devotees praying for me, than seek a silent therapy where the dentist would just put her hands on me and make me close my eyes. It's the same thing but free (without any taxes as well).

I apologize for the long post. I love my mom, but this is just ridiculous. 

TLDR: i hate my mom for making me go to a wrong kind of therapy, believing her dentist that my psych was a sham, made me stop taking my meds, and now has booked me another session",t2_mu97lo10h,False,,0,False,i hate my mom for making me go to a wrong kind of therapist,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Rant '}, {'a': ':angry-cry:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/kns090pd89za1_t5_2qnv4/angry-cry'}]",r/bipolar,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18yctm5,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Rant :angry-cry:,False,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1704373817.0,richtext,,,,text,self.bipolar,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;may contain trigger warnings like religious traumas,,, ig&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m Southeast Asian, and a lot of SEA parents have ample to no knowledge about dealing with mental health at all. My mom is one of those people who would believe in voodoo and also be a roman catholic at the same time. She&amp;#39;s also old enough to be fooled by those &amp;quot;cure all&amp;quot; medicines and ointments, and I&amp;#39;m the very opposite of her (considering that she&amp;#39;s in her 60s and I&amp;#39;m in my early 20s), whereas I would hyper-fixate on researching about important stuff (to me, at least). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder I, after missing my long term quiz, and ultimately found a doctor to give me a medical certificate, and prescriptions. She&amp;#39;s not very familiar with the term and she had been viewing me as someone who was rude and moody, not until my diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very endearing that she was worrying about me at first. I got to tell her that it had been really long since I was feeling this way (u know,,, depresso and mania) and it wasn&amp;#39;t just a one time thing. I was suffering silently ever since highschool and I&amp;#39;m aware of that (I&amp;#39;m in college now). And I was scared to let her know about this because I KNOW she won&amp;#39;t take it very well and I KNOW that she&amp;#39;s going to try various unresearched thing that claims to &amp;quot;cure&amp;quot; people of their said illness. The first few days, she had been following exactly what my doctor told us. NOT UNTIL she contacted her &lt;strong&gt;Dentist&lt;/strong&gt; (in bold to emphasize the ridiculousness of the situation) who she claims to know more than what their doctorate degree indicates. She basically booked an appointment with that dentist for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dentist made this &amp;quot;Healing&amp;quot; Therapy with me (which costs just as much as a real therapy) . Upon seeing their office and clinic, it was clear that they&amp;#39;re also very religious given the amount of Jesus-es I&amp;#39;ve seen. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I&amp;#39;d rather let my mom take me to a church and ask the priest to exorcise the hell out of my depression than this weird dentist thing, disinforming my mom about mental health and medications - which, given my luck, didn&amp;#39;t happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom now believes that everything that my Psych doctor told me is a scheme, intentionally making their patients worse so they could come back to them. I think it&amp;#39;s ridiculous that she finds that healing therapy stuff more helpful than a doctor with years of expertise with this stuff, ALL because this weirdass dentist discredited psychiatrists. (TW: &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;They basically claimed that my anti-psychotics would make me depend on it and make me feel a lot worse. She then referred to hollywood artists committing s-word because of &amp;quot;good ol western medicine&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom, in turn, made me stop taking my meds (anti-psychotics) and this had made me go back to not sleeping on time with racing thoughts as usual. She&amp;#39;s planning to book another appointment with this mojo dentist. This has been making my mental health spiral down again seeing that we&amp;#39;re also struggling with money, yet she&amp;#39;s choosing to make me go to this clown. She&amp;#39;s eager to make me go because she apparently was promised that my mood disorder would go away in a few sessions. &lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hello friends.

I am writing to say thank you.

I carry alot of guilt and shame.

Not only over my condition, but over the things I've done both to - and infront- of people.

I am at work stewing in the thought of ""what do they think of me.""

I had a psychiatric symptom breakdown a few weeks ago infront of my coworkers.

At times, it's tough sitting in the presence of others.

When I am struggling, I think of the broken/ mutilated toys of toy story.

The toys live in the dark, hidden in Sids room.

The toys accept all toys that are broken and mutilated.

There is a scene in which the toys actively accept another toy that was mutilated by Sid...

Its a tear jerker because the newly mutilated toy shows extreme emotion over being accepted, being shown love, and having a community to call home

The toy group that represents a group for those that aren't 100%

,schizophrenia,"I'm seeing a therapist because I like getting different angles of thought from various people.  A therapist has seen a lot of patients which would give them more angles than a normal person would.  Finding a way of thinking that I would have never thought of before has opened avenues of beneficial therapy and recovery.  Recovery being something helpful in my life that was not currently there.

Now when I started talking to my therapist about why I couldn't get things done, she gave me the normal routine of ""Well you got to try harder.""  We know in schizophrenics with negative symptoms that this is not possible.  There are moments of remission and often those negative symptoms come right back with time, this is why things don't get done.  I was somewhat baffled by her response when I realized she must have not had experience with schizophrenics.

So, I did the simplest thing, looked up what therapies are used for schizophrenics.  After a quick web search, I found that only two therapies are used for schizophrenia, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and Acceptance Therapy.  CBT is very common but I looked up Acceptance Therapy Therapists in my area, there were none.

I found Acceptance on a day of suicidal thinking.  Never could I figure out why I was unable to compare to my peers, it haunted me for 16 years.  Until it came to me while I was crying, I said to myself, ""I am not a capable person because my brain has a dysfunction, I accept this and move on.""  My depression of 16 years was lifted and has not returned after 3.5 years.

How can it be that Acceptance of who we are not be the most common therapy.  Knowing who we are is the most important thing we could recognize.

I am somewhat stuck now.  I believe that therapy has benefits but what happens when the therapist doesn't understand what schizophrenia is even about.  My past psychiatrist of 19 years did psychotherapy along with medicating, which is recommended for schizophrenics.  He died this past year of cancer, he was a great doctor and a great man.  Since he is gone, I am stuck with professionals that don't understand.

Well anyways. I’m an avid writer and have written in my journal almost every day since my senior year of HS. That was 12 years ago! Anyways I started reading these and it has made me feel things I don’t like. 

It was fun at first living through HS drama and such again, but as I kept reading the more disappointed I have become with where I am now. 

I wasn’t diagnosed with schizophrenia till I was 20 and about 1/2 through college. I just seems like the only things I’ve accomplished since then was graduating with a MA in political science and marrying my wife (my college sweetheart). 

It’s just like the trajectory of my life was irrevocably altered by my schizophrenia. I only work part time at an outdoors store cause I can’t really handle more than that. I try to help around the house, but that is hard some days. 

I’m just on the struggle bus right now and I don’t know how to get off. How do I overcome this feeling that I haven’t accomplished almost anything I wanted to when I was younger.

,schizophrenia,"Hey, new to this subreddit but not to schizophrenia (diagnosed 7 years ago, 4 major psychotic episodes)

I am recently discovering that my antipsychotic medications contribute to addictive behaviours (I had/have a severe addiction to cocaine and other stimulants, then there’s also binge eating, online shopping, smoking.. a lot of addictive behaviours that have been out of control since starting antipsychotics)

I stopped taking abilify recently and my cravings for these “extras” stopped. I didn’t crave cocaine at all. I stopped smoking altogether.

Are there any non-prescription alternatives to treating schizophrenia like therapy or something? I’m stuck. I don’t want to have these addictions, cocaine has ruined my life, but I definitely can’t live in psychosis. 😔

Other medications I’ve tried are: latuda and olanzipine. These were even worse. When I switched to a very low dose of abilify, I had a little balance.. but I need it to be better than this.

,schizophrenia,"So, honestly I don’t know where to start. Idk if I’m schizophrenic or just psychotic I want to believe that it’s neither of those because everything I’ve experienced feels so real especially lately. I have had periods of seeming psychosis throughout my life, since age 14 and above. First I thought I was being haunted by a demon. I saw it occasionally and heard it once and was paranoid constantly. It then morphed into feeling like everything was fake and a simulation, and I became convinced I needed to kill my self. I didn’t, idk why. I’ve never really thought my family was sinister and so even though I’m not sure they’re truly real I don’t want to hurt them. Anyway, I was pretty okay for a year and didn’t really suffer from anything other than just depression and I just tried my best to suppress my intrusive thoughts and I stopped seeing things.

But in summer 2021 I became paranoid again. I was sick with anxiety and so suicidal. I thought the government was after me. Cameras in my house. I was convinced and exhausted constantly. Began to sh/starve myself. Paranoia wasn’t as bad because self destructive tendencies fried my brain and took the edge off. I went through lapses of paranoia and occasionally seeing things. I don’t want to call them hallucinations. I’m not sure they were. I don’t know what’s real anymore. 

Now though I’m lost in my head again. I don’t trust the world around me. I’m not sure I’m truly human. I feel like I’m an alien, something different somehow. I’m not sure everyone has a soul. I think some ppl are soulless, cognizant, but more like robots, and those who are aware of being without a soul try and steal it from those who do. I think it makes sense as to why the worlds so fucked up, why people do the things they do. I get that I sound crazy but I’m so exhausted. I just feel tired, never trusting my reality.

I told my boyfriend the first part about not feeling human and he said that that must be very scary but comforted me and told me I was safe. He told me that I can’t hurt myself and that he can’t live without me. And that I should see my therapist again. I don’t want to.

Idk if I’m schizophrenic or just psychotic I want to believe that it’s neither of those because everything I’ve experienced feels so real especially lately. I have had periods of seeming psychosis throughout my life, since age 14 and above. First I thought I was being haunted by a demon. I saw it occasionally and heard it once and was paranoid constantly. It then morphed into feeling like everything was fake and a simulation, and I became convinced I needed to kill my self. I didn’t, idk why. I’ve never really thought my family was sinister and so even though I’m not sure they’re truly real I don’t want to hurt them. Anyway, I was pretty okay for a year and didn’t really suffer from anything other than just depression and I just tried my best to suppress my intrusive thoughts and I stopped seeing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in summer 2021 I became paranoid again. I was sick with anxiety and so suicidal. I thought the government was after me. Cameras in my house. I was convinced and exhausted constantly. Began to sh/starve myself. Paranoia wasn’t as bad because self destructive tendencies fried my brain and took the edge off. I went through lapses of paranoia and occasionally seeing things. I don’t want to call them hallucinations. I’m not sure they were. I don’t know what’s real anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now though I’m lost in my head again. I don’t trust the world around me. I’m not sure I’m truly human. I feel like I’m an alien, something different somehow. I’m not sure everyone has a soul. I think some ppl are soulless, cognizant, but more like robots, and those who are aware of being without a soul try and steal it from those who do. I think it makes sense as to why the worlds so fucked up, why people do the things they do. I get that I sound crazy but I’m so exhausted. I just feel tired, never trusting my reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told my boyfriend the first part about not feeling human and he said that that must be very scary but comforted me and told me I was safe. He told me that I can’t hurt myself and that he can’t live without me. And that I should see my therapist again. I don’t want to. I don’t want to tell others my thoughts and be locked up or forced on drugs and not when I feel I’m right. I’m self aware that everyone thinks it’s schizophrenia but the symptoms don’t line up, I don’t even see things that often. I’m so tired. Idek what I want, maybe just encouragement because I have no one to talk to about this&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hi everyone-I'm a current PhD student at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). Over the past few years I've run studies looking at how people learn about and understand emotions, and how experiences of psychosis might influence these processes.

I'm running the third version on an online study for individuals 18 and older that regularly have unusual experiences such as hearing or seeing things others don't, feeling watched or followed, or having thoughts that don't quite make sense. At this time, the study is only available to US residents.

This study is completed entirely online. You will answer questions about your background, complete three tasks about emotions, and fill out questionnaires about your current thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This study will last approximately 45-60 minutes.

,schizophrenia,"Hey guys, hope you are doing well and are having a nice friday. I have a question I was hoping somebody here might be able to help me with. 

My brother has had schizophrenia for a couple of years now and has been on and off medication with psychotic episodes of varying degrees. Recently, he has had himself repeatedly hosptialized for conditions (mainly shortage of breath, sometimes heart palpatations) that he attributes to swelling within his neck. He claims this swelling is caused by an underlying thyroid condition called Hashimoto syndrome that he has been diagnosed with and is actively taking medication against. However, none of the multiple doctors that he has been to see have been able to confirm this or diagnose any other ongoing condition. Is it possible he is just imagining his conditions? He does (probably rightly so) blame past stays in psychiatric hospitals for other health problems he's had in the past and while I fully understand his distrust of the medical system that has done him wrong in the past, the fact that multiple doctors have failed in diagnosing anything does confuse me.

Do things like this happen? Is it feasible that he is having something like a panic attack and being delusional about the actual symptoms? I really want to help him but we live in different countries and it is hard for me to tell sometimes what exactly is going on, as he communicates very unclearly.

Hi all,

Are you interested in taking part in some research? I am completing this research as part of my training as a Trainee Clinical Psychologist at Salomons Institute of Applied Psychology (Canterbury Christ Church University). 

We hope to learn more about the effect of the timing of childhood adversities on people’s later experiences of psychotic-like experiences, through their narratives. The purpose of this study is also to get a better understanding of factors that may be protective during adverse experiences and factors that contribute to managing these experiences.  

Participants will be asked to talk about the past and difficult experiences, which can bring about distressing or intense emotions. Therefore, we ask you to consider if this would negatively impact on your wellbeing.

**Who can participate?**  
\- Aged 18+  
\- English as a first language  
\- People who have faced adversity in childhood (before 18 years)  
\- Experienced voices, visions, unusual or unshared beliefs (sometimes referred to as ‘psychosis’ or psychotic-like experiences) in adulthood

*Childhood adversity could be, but not restricted to: experiencing/witnessing physical, sexual, emotional abuse, violence at home, war, natural disasters, poverty, family breakdown, crime, parental/carer/ sibling illness or death, bullying, moving country.*

*Psychotic-like experiences could be, but not restricted to: Auditory hallucinations (often referred to as voice hearing), Visual hallucinations (Or seeing visions) Unusual beliefs, Confusing or rapidly changing thoughts, Disrupted or constant speech.*

**What will I need to do? (2 stages)**  

1. Brief phone call:  
\- To establish eligibility for the study  
\- To get some more information
2. Virtual Interview:  
\- 60-90 minute virtual interview where you will be ask to tell your life story  
\- You will be asked to share difficult experiences in childhood and psychotic-like experiences  
\- This will be audio recorded.

This study has been approved by the Salomons Ethics Panel (Salomons Institute for Applied Psychology, Canterbury Christ Church University) on 13th July 2023.

,schizophrenia,"Hi, I’m Basil and I’m 16NB . I’m currently in highschool (11th grade) and I just wanted some advice on how to manage school with psychosis. 

I don’t have schizophrenia as a diagnosis but my therapist thinks I should . So we’re working on that which is why I’m posting here. 

Recently, I’ve been having really bad auditory and visual hallucinations. I can’t concentrate in school, I can’t stay organized, and even talking and gathering my thoughts has been harder than usual. 

I stayed home from school today because I was stressed but I was yelled at and threatened by parents. 

How do you guys manage to go to school with schizophrenia or psychosis?

I also go to a behavioral school for kids with behavioral issues or mental issues (not sure if that’s the right word to use.) so do what you will with that info. I’m also already on anti psychotic I believe, have been for three years. However, it doesn’t work anymore and nobody will up the dose for me :(

,schizophrenia,So my story is long. I fell into weed during college and briefly heard a demonic voice (like it was a growl then it was gone never to be heard again). I was possibly on adhd or depression meds so idk if that’s influences it. I also took a lot and drank often with it. It caused fear and I went to doctor and started Abilify. I continued to smoke quite heavily and eventually quit after it made me thinking I was dying constantly. During Covid stopped my medicine. I developed a weird obsessional crush on a coworker and made up a strange scenario and believed it after being rejected. I have issues with rejection and abandonment and I grew up isolated. I have adhd and autism. Got seveare anxiety and depression but it comes and goes and sometimes I take my meds. Anyways I have had some strange breakdowns. One where I thought my friends were talking about me years ago. It is unclear if they were or not.  And one where I was paranoid about one talking behind my back and I often listen by his door. Anyways fast forward I have hypochondriac like issue where I convince myself I’m sometimes dying with google. Most of the times I have symptoms but not I’m afraid they are real. I started dating my bf. Got back on antipsychotics. I was misdiagnosed with bipolar  when I smoked. I developed acute dystonia and had to suddenly stop. I got very paranoid about my relationship. We have issues of course anyways I was triggered by finding my friends underwear and I completely lost it. I have bits of clarity but on bad nights she stay over I would check the locks and think she’s in bathroom with him. I thought I saw her shadow in a video he once sent and saw a text from her  during all of this. All of which after I was able to clearly realize wasn’t true. Most at night or when I drank. I was going through the worst stress of my life. My doctors say it’s anxiety and autism but I can’t get over it. I look up symptoms and convinced I am developing it. My dad is bipolar and my family has lots of mental health issues anxiety being extreme. I had therapist tell me I was developing schizophrenia to the point I when I spiral I google and freak out and don’t leave my house. Once lasted a month. I’ve had fears like this with cancer and Lyme disease but knowing everything I know… I’m fucked… I wish I never touched weed. Im about to turn 25 when it shows up. I know I can’t prevent it if I were to develop it. But I feel so hopeless. Is there a chance my doctors are right and it’s just extreme anxiety and stress? If I have delusions or hallucinations they are non bizarre and often misterpretations. Anyone else experience something similar? Btw it’s been like 5 years length of this all happening.

,schizophrenia," 

Does the human tailbone still wag? For the past 5 years I have been watching for it.

You can stimulate your tailbone to wag by wobbling your knee slightly for a second, stop it abruptly, and then watch for your tail to start wagging.

A wagging tail used to lead me down schizophrenic rabbit holes because it would make me dizzy while sitting still and I would associate it with voices.

Other wobbling, dizzy type visual hallucinations can come from: the center of the forehead, inner ear on either side, the vision of either eye, your musculoskeletal system, breathing.

Nervous gestures like crinkling a piece of paper in your pocket or twitching, movements that aren't accomplishing anything, those made while waiting, one makes these gestures in response to the tailbone and stifling its wobbling effects.

A natural tailbone wag occurs when you release adrenaline. Your size and any animals size controls how and when you get excited. Adrenaline can be a happy excitement or a fight or flight response. Adrenaline flight response is anxiety.

One useful trick to observe control over dizzy visual hallucinations is: stare at something for a good couple seconds, then turn your attention in your vision to something in your peripherals, after a second it may begin to wobble. You can move the wobbling around between objects by changing your minds attention to different objects in your vision. Focusing on nothing will make your whole vision wobble.

,schizophrenia,"This is a lot of rambling just to warn.

Last night was one of my worst sleeps, and yesterday thus had some of my worst cognitive and negative symptoms. I was just absolutely fucked. I was hoping for tonight to be different, but roommates messed with the thermostat again, woke to a 90 degree room out of a dead sleep after an hour and a half of struggling to sleep. I don't know how long I would've slept if I hadn't been woken up, but it was a damn good sleep. I'm old enough to know my body at this point; it would've been at least 3 hours. I got 3 hours last night. 

I don't know how I'm so capable of thinking right now. Likely because I'm so fucking wired from being triggered because my partner and I have explained again and again to these fuckwads, you turn the heat above 70 and our bedroom gets fucking unlivable, and we both are heat sensitive as hell. Literally over 90 degrees before the heat fucking shuts off, I'd sweat through my pajamas and my blanket was fucking soaked. At this point, I'm not even sure if me thinking our roommates wanna kill me is a fucking delusion or if they are. Disclaimer, it's uh probably a delusion. Idk, I'm also trans and they're kinda really against that, so it's hard to tell lmao I wonder why my paranoia keeps getting worse!!! I wonder!!! I fucking wonder!!! I don't want to talk about ""why I don't leave"" btw, I'm ignoring everyone that asks that even if you have other stuff in your comment. Don't ask that. Thinking about it will literally trigger me when I've finally started calming down, don't ask why I haven't left. 

I just want to sleep. I have literal trauma surrounding sleep aids but I'm desperate enough to try them again after 15 years. I'm already paranoid as hell (my worst positive symptom), I don't wanna think about my hallucinations really starting up again. The visual ones are manageable. The tactile ones, I'm literally terrified of getting those back bad again. It's always bugs. The visual ones are usually bugs now that I think about it actually. And I actually have yet to identify IF I get delusions. Which means I'm probably just unaware honestly, I was unaware of my hallucinations being hallucinations for 20 goddamn years. I wanna sleep. I'm so fucking tired. And I'm so fucking angry right now. I've calmed down from the initial adrenaline rush but I can tell I'm still absolutely fucking wired. I'm really good at waiting it out but can it stop faster? Or maybe it's the only reason I can think right now. 

I should play a game. Or listen to music. But they're Wrong right now. I swear to god dealing with my brain's own hypocrisy is going to give me a fucking ulcer or something if I don't already have one. And I don't mean I'm lacking energy or enjoyment, I don't think I am right now. I'm just so fucking pissed off. I can't imagine music or a game right now, I'm just so fucking pissed off. And it feels kinda good. I've tried keeping myself quiet and ""calm"" and a fucking doormat for so goddamn fukcing long, it feels good. I'm also very fucking triggered, this is a symptom, and it's not a good one! But once this wears off, I probably won't be able to think or concentrate. I can already kinda feel it. It's terrifying, it's like I'm not even alive. It's coming on fast though, as I type this. I gusss I'm calming down whether I want to or not.

Calm is the reason I started writing this though. I'd still rather be calm and barely alive/thinking than pissed off like that. I sent my partner a lot of angry things, not angry at HIM, but angry at our roommates, and he's a sensitive guy. He has notifications on so he'll be able to read like 60% of them and it'd be cruel to leave him with 60% of a rant and no conclusion so I can't delete it, it'd fuck with him worse than reading my rant so uh oopsie... again... I hate getting so angry when I feel unsafe. Makes me feel like a ""violent schizophrenic"" stereotype. And my worst symptom by far is fucking paranoia.

,schizophrenia,"On my medical charts it says I have schizophrenia but it feels weird having that label when I’m not even sure I actually have it.

Below are the details of the psychosis but it’s long so feel free to skip that part/section, but I put it in case it could be useful. I’m not looking for medical advice so hopefully this doesn’t get removed but just want to hear perspectives and opinions from people who actually have schizophrenia. 

Back in 2021 I was under an insane amount of stress and psychosis came on out of nowhere one day during work. I had no idea what day of the week it was (someone told me it was a Friday, and I would never forget if it was Friday ever) and I just felt vaguely confused all day. Got in my car and read an article about Huntingtons disease (a progressive disease sort of like parkinsons or dementia) and was convinced that I had it and that my entire family knew but never told me. I was convinced my best friend was hired by my family because they knew I was going to die and needed a good friend. I called a bunch of family members accusing them of this and then they took me to a crisis center where my delusion rapidly changed to thinking I was being punished for something I did in a past life or that this was all a police set up my family helped with and that I was going to jail. I eventually started to think I was dead and in hell (like that my entire life has actually been disguised as real but was really hell and that I did something terrible when I was alive on earth but no memory of that life). I started to think they were going to deprive me of water as torture so I grabbed hand sanitizer and drank it then I walked out of the building on to the side of the street and the police quickly came and had me involuntarily committed. They had me wait in an ER room before being transferred to get things in order with the door open and a “sitter” outside. People were walking by the door mocking me or repeating things I’ve said to people before in the past. And when the TV was turned on all the commercials looked like they were from the 90s (even a chipotle commercial which wasn’t around then) and the people on the news were speaking gibberish. I now realize that those were hallucinations. I thought those were the only time but days later my doctor wrote in my notes (which I saw when I got out on my online portal) that I denied having hallucinations but she noted that I was “clearly preoccupied with something external” and my eyes would rapidly dart around the room. She also said I would start saying a sentence but get lost and not finish them. There was an event where I asked if I could touch a nurse’s eyelashes and tried to grab her rounds binder out of her hands. I literally have no memory of this but it’s in my notes. Things started to feel more “normal” each day and I was released after 2 weeks once my family was on board. When I left I questioned if things were just back to “fake normal” again and if I was still in hell or a simulation because everything that happened felt so real and fucked up. 

Back to today. I’ve been mostly okay since then- no hallucinations, no hearing things, no actual full on psychosis. My problem is I think I still have paranoia but not sure if that is the accurate term. Like for example, I often wonder if my professor just pretends very well to like me but actually hates me and is constantly analyzing my every move and testing to see how I would respond to certain questions. Or I will wonder if my aunts texts have some underlying meaning or that she is being passive aggressive. Things like that. But could that just be overthinking/anxiety related considering it’s just me contemplating if it’s true rather than downright believing it is?

I belong to a schizoaffective support group on Facebook and people always post about having hallucinations daily for years and that it’s just an every day thing for them. I can’t relate to any of them since mine only occurred during psychosis which was only once years ago.
