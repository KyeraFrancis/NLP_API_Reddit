My friend is currently 15 years old and has been set on joining the military for a while now. She wants to join the army but recently heard (I don't know where) that she couldn't. This is because recently, she was checked into a mental hospital for depression, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. She was only there for 4 days and has been doing normal life stuff since. She was and still is distraught at hearing this because she feels like her future is ruined. She is on medication for her anxiety and depression and sees a therapist. Is it true that she straight up can't enlist, or are there potential waivers or rules that can help her since she is a few years away from that?

&lt;p&gt;My friend is currently 15 years old and has been set on joining the military for a while now. She wants to join the army but recently heard (I don&amp;#39;t know where) that she couldn&amp;#39;t. This is because recently, she was checked into a mental hospital for depression, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. She was only there for 4 days and has been doing normal life stuff since. She was and still is distraught at hearing this because she feels like her future is ruined. She is on medication for her anxiety and depression and sees a therapist. Is it true that she straight up can&amp;#39;t enlist, or are there potential waivers or rules that can help her since she is a few years away from that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve gone through most postings through online/reddit about this mos. I know once AIT is done it’s all unit dependent on what I’ll actually be doing. But with only having an A+ is the AIT difficult? I’ve taken a few other classes ranging from NET+ and Sec+, also windows 10 server from this shitty trade school in AZ. No certifications for those though.

,Army,"**BLUF: the Army places too much emphasis on ACFT scores and needs to start caring more about actual professional development when it comes to promotions, OMLs, etc.**

When the ACFT was first announced, it made sense as a concept. The APFT had a lot of issues: it caused injuries (situps are bad), it wasn't representative of holistic fitness, and it was super easy to game. Creating a new fitness assessment that was based more closely on what soldiers would have to do during combat made a lot of sense. We all know that didn't go as well as it could have. Let's quickly go through some highlights from the ACFT's struggles:

* It started off as a sex and age neutral test, only having different categories based on MOS. This made a ton of sense.

* An overwhelming majority of women failed the leg tuck, so it was replaced with an option to do a plank. Then, the plank replaced the leg tuck altogether.

* The test was revised to have age and gender categories.

* Congress told the Army not to do that, we didn't listen, and the fate of the test was in limbo once again.

* The new NDAA lets us keep sex-based assessment, but requires stricter standards for combat MOSs.

Personally, I think the ACFT's original method of grading made more sense than anything else we've ever done. Grading by sex and/or age seems silly to me when the battlefield doesn't care about those things. Indirect fire doesn't bracket you more slowly if you're old; your 250 pound (in kit) battle buddy who got shot doesn't weigh less if you're a woman. Soldiers should all be judged by their ability (or lack thereof) to meet **the standard**, whatever we determine that is.

I was having a conversation with a female soldier recently about all of this, and she mentioned that she was in favor of the sex-based grading for the ACFT because doing otherwise was unfair to females when it came to things like promotion points, OMLs for schools, and anything else where your score matters are more than just a method of assessing fitness. She's not wrong, but she's complaining about a symptom when she thinks she's talking about a root issue.

The root issue is that **the Army places FAR too much weight on fitness assessments** for things like promotions, who gets to go to what school, or selections for support personnel to SOF units. The best example of this is how promotion points are calculated. a maxed PT test is nearly worth more than the most you can achieve by maxing out PME and correspondence courses *combined*. how does that make sense? Is it just laziness, because a PT test is easier to grade than doing the work and combing through the various military professional development and MOS-specific courses and deciding what they should be worth? Or is the old joke about how soldiers are meatheads at heart little more true than we want it to be?

,Army,"Need some S1 help here, I've ran into an issue.
Gonna try to keep this as vague as possible

TLDR
Failed acft during 1st contract in the Reserves, deployed, got out, came back in and am now running into issues with a temp promotion as well as a possible work around.

Here's a little back story of everything first.
First contract was in the Reserves. Due to my original unit disbanding, I was sent to an entirely different unit and had to go back to AIT to receive an additional MOS as ASI. 
Manage to locate a unit in the Midwest and transferred over there to do my original MOS.
Before one drill date I had broken up with a long time ex, and decided to just drive down to drill with my dog since I wasn't taking care of myself. At the end of drill, was told to do a walk on BLC course, was not prepared physically or mentally.
Took and failed the ACFT, but probably would have been kicked out anyways due to not having any of the required packing list other than a couple uniforms, let alone I was sleeping with my dog in my truck.

Fast forward a bit, volunteered for a deployment. Enjoyed the beginning of it, but due to things happening at the end of it I went to the SRU. During my time at the SRU, somehow I was scheduled for a BLC slot. Even had I known, I wouldn't have been able to go to that BLC slot due to receiving care. Decided to get out of the Army for awhile directly afterwards because of reasons, left with an HD. 

Fast forward a bit more, missed the Army and decided to go active this time. Wanted more certifications that the Army would provide and I just missed it. 

Coming into the Army was a mess, recruiter messed up my paperwork and I was hit with a Fraudulent Enlistment, had my SC revoked for a little bit and got it back. Was a pain but got through all of that and was happy to get to my next duty station to do my job. 
Found out my TIS and BASD wasnt correct and met with retention to fix that, she submitted the documents to IPERMs and I in return gave them to my S1. When I finally looked at my ippsa profile, everything was wrong. TIS, TIG, BASD, previous units(appereantly Ive got 20 or so different listing in the same UIC), deployments

This marked the beginning of my issues with S1. Had so many issues with me submitting my college, awards, deployments and everything else. I would submit them, make appointments and nothing would get done and only managed to get my awards uploaded because I stayed there until I watched them do it because I wanted to pick up.

Once that was done, my points were looking good minus my college. I killed the P Board, had a BLC date set and a week before broke my toe because of a soldier smacking a 88m tow bar we were carrying causing us to all to drop it.
For some reason though, I was not populating on the OML even though I had secured the BLC slot.

By the time my toe healed, I was deployed. Tried to get promoted because I had made points twice since getting my P status at that point however my name never populated on the list.

Since then, I've submitted 3 Pars, each one with more and more information detailing reasons and supporting documents.
This last one stated that it was because I have a history of failed BLC slots, in particular the one I had in the Reserves in my first contract before my break in service. 
I've checked ATTRS, and the 2 slots I had after that first one were med releases. However, after thoroughly checking my Iperms I could not locate the 1059 for the Reserves BLC slot. After calling the schoolhouse and speaking to them, they informed me it was up to the unit at the time to upload it which they never did and that they didn't have the record of it in their paper system.

Ive heard so much about what could be wrong, and what I should do and how, that I finally said enough and was hoping someone who knows their S1 stuff can help me out.

Things I've heard and been told so far:

•I'm barred from Enlistment due to the failed BLC slot 
-If that were the case i wouldn't have been able     to come back in, I even had retention check it out and they verified that I have no flag and I'm not barred
•TIS isn't accurate in IPPSA so that's the reason I'm not populating on the OML and not getting promoted
•Need the CGs permission to go to BLC and have a copy of the 1059 in question (which was never uploaded)
•Reserves stuff doesn't fully transfer over so I should be good
•No record of the 1059 for the failed BLC so just call HRC and ask them to remove it
-This just feels sketchy
•I just have to wait till I'm able to get another walk on slot
-I hope that's not the case, because I'm losing motivation fast because everything is all messed up and I feel that I'm only now being semi helped because of reasons.


There's so much more also going on. I was supposed to transfer to another unit that has a much better S1 and has walk on capabilities for BLC, but now I can't because the receiving CSM doesn't want to do a swap for swap, so now I'm awaiting a open door meeting with my current CSM to see if they're willing to give me away so I can finally get my career progression moving forward.

,Army,"Hey everyone,

I'm a sergeant and I've got a bit of a situation with one of my soldiers that I could use some advice on. This troop has been under a flag for two years now, but there's been no punishment handed down or even a formal reading. It's a bit of an odd situation, and I'm not sure how to proceed.

From my perspective, it doesn't seem fair to the soldier to be left hanging like this. It's impacting their morale and potentially their career progression. I believe in maintaining discipline, but this just doesn't sit right with me.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that this soldier has proactively sought help from behavioral health for other personal issues. They're actively engaged in counseling and are making a genuine effort to rehabilitate and improve themselves. This commitment to self-improvement and mental health is commendable and, in my opinion, should be factored into how we handle their flag status. It shows a level of responsibility and self-awareness that I believe is a positive sign. 

I'm considering pushing this up the chain of command to get it resolved, either by removing the flag (if they've been squared away since it was placed) or by moving forward with whatever actions are deemed necessary if there are still unresolved issues.

Has anyone dealt with something like this before? How did you handle it? Any advice on how to approach this with the higher-ups?

,Army,"Please bear with me so I can explain my situation- 
Advice and criticism is welcomed… 

First question. what is my MSO? Is it my original MSO (05/2024), my “reduced” MSO (05/2023, already passed) or did I fuck myself and give myself a new MSO out in 2026?

Second question, is it hard to go TPU to IRR these days? Nothing on the USARC share point mentions it not being a possible option, there’s an in depth walk through about how to do the process in iPPSA. Is anything about my situation going to cause problems with going IRR until I hit my MSO, whether it’s in 2024 or 2026?

Third question, does anyone have good things to say about IMA? I have a hard time believing there is a real job opening that I’m qualified for where I can just “show up when I feel like it”. That sounds like the “no colonel left behind fantasyland” for senior officers waiting to retire.

Situation:

Commissioned in 2016- 8 year MSO w/ 5 active years. No ragrets.

Ended up doing almost 7yr active duty, then I UQR’d. ETS date from AD of 3/31/2023

During my transition I had serious financial, employment, and health insurance (infant at home, sick wife) concerns.

Decided to give TPU life / USAR a try, as I have some friends that went that route and enjoy it. I was told at the time, and still am under the impression was a no-obligation-added move.

My ROCC sets me up with a transfer memo to where I don’t have any additional time added to MSO- I declined to take a bonus, but I did take the 36 month MOB deferment, and I take the 1 year MSO reduction, and I take the TAMP180 benefit. 

At the time of my ETS, my actual MSO end date was 05/2024. 
The 1 year MSO reduction would put me at 05/2023 (yes, a date in the past…)
So I go about my business the last 10 months or so, do what I need to do and show up to BA and be a team player. 

Now, however, my circumstances have changed and I need to get out. I have a 1 year old, I landed my dream civilian job, I have a heavy workload of traveling &amp; OT pay coming up over the next year. Not to mention I ended up with a higher-than-expected VA rating from active duty injuries. 

Because of civilian career obligations, I will be unable to do AT, and unable to drill most of this year due to work and calendar conflicts. No, I’m not willing to miss out on my civilian pay and benefits for USAR unless I have literally no option. 

From a cost-benefit standpoint, USAR is barely worth it: Factoring my VA debt from drill days, I make considerably less money in USAR on a per hourly basis. thus, if I’m going to miss 1/4 to 1/2 of my weekends to travel for my higher paying civilian job, it’s not worth it to give up another weekend of family time for the benefit we get from drill pay + tricare (I can get the best high deductible family plan from my employer for $200/mo more). 

Not to mention the considerable unpaid time sink of being a staff officer - and the PAIN IN THE ASS of dealing with owing a VA debt, and constantly having to stay on top of two careers. I am also feeling discouraged from the nonstop pay and personnel issues I’ve experienced, and seen other soldiers experience in my reserve unit. My heart isn’t in it anymore since I realized that the grass is actually a lot greener on the other side.

I see 3 options: IMA, IRR, or ETS. 

When I bring up this situation to my unit, they tell me OH HO HO you actually owe us 3 years, glhf. But nobody can produce a document that I signed that says I have another 3 year MSO… They also say that I won’t get accepted to IRR due to undermanning issues. 

So I guess according to them I can either go IMA, remote drill from my other job, or just take it on the chin? 

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.",t2_rcr7f18i9,False,,0,False,"Transition out? Or…? (O3, AD -&gt; USAR -&gt; ETS/IRR/…?)",[],r/army,False,7.0,,0,,,False,t3_18y7n8n,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1704354502.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please bear with me so I can explain my situation- 
Advice and criticism is welcomed… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First question. what is my MSO? Is it my original MSO (05/2024), my “reduced” MSO (05/2023, already passed) or did I fuck myself and give myself a new MSO out in 2026?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second question, is it hard to go TPU to IRR these days? Nothing on the USARC share point mentions it not being a possible option, there’s an in depth walk through about how to do the process in iPPSA. Is anything about my situation going to cause problems with going IRR until I hit my MSO, whether it’s in 2024 or 2026?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third question, does anyone have good things to say about IMA? I have a hard time believing there is a real job opening that I’m qualified for where I can just “show up when I feel like it”. That sounds like the “no colonel left behind fantasyland” for senior officers waiting to retire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commissioned in 2016- 8 year MSO w/ 5 active years. No ragrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ended up doing almost 7yr active duty, then I UQR’d. ETS date from AD of 3/31/2023&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my transition I had serious financial, employment, and health insurance (infant at home, sick wife) concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decided to give TPU life / USAR a try, as I have some friends that went that route and enjoy it. I was told at the time, and still am under the impression was a no-obligation-added move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ROCC sets me up with a transfer memo to where I don’t have any additional time added to MSO- I declined to take a bonus, but I did take the 36 month MOB deferment, and I take the 1 year MSO reduction, and I take the TAMP180 benefit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of my ETS, my actual MSO end date was 05/2024. 
The 1 year MSO reduction would put me at 05/2023 (yes, a date in the past…)
So I go about my business the last 10 months or so, do what I need to do and show up to BA and be a team player. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, however, my circumstances have changed and I need to get out. I have a 1 year old, I landed my dream civilian job, I have a heavy workload of traveling &amp;amp; OT pay coming up over the next year. Not to mention I ended up with a higher-than-expected VA rating from active duty injuries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of civilian career obligations, I will be unable to do AT, and unable to drill most of this year due to work and calendar conflicts. No, I’m not willing to miss out on my civilian pay and benefits for USAR unless I have literally no option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a cost-benefit standpoint, USAR is barely worth it: Factoring my VA debt from drill days, I make considerably less money in USAR on a per hourly basis. thus, if I’m going to miss 1/4 to 1/2 of my weekends to travel for my higher paying civilian job, it’s not worth it to give up another weekend of family time for the benefit we get from drill pay + tricare (I can get the best high deductible family plan from my employer for $200/mo more). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the considerable unpaid time sink of being a staff officer - and the PAIN IN THE ASS of dealing with owing a VA debt, and constantly having to stay on top of two careers. I am also feeling discouraged from the nonstop pay and personnel issues I’ve experienced, and seen other soldiers experience in my reserve unit. My heart isn’t in it anymore since I realized that the grass is actually a lot greener on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see 3 options: IMA, IRR, or ETS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I bring up this situation to my unit, they tell me OH HO HO you actually owe us 3 years, glhf. But nobody can produce a document that I signed that says I have another 3 year MSO… They also say that I won’t get accepted to IRR due to undermanning issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess according to them I can either go IMA, remote drill from my other job, or just take it on the chin? &lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"
I’ll try to make this post as clear as possible. 
I went to an inpatient facility for drugs (opioid dependency disorder).. 

I am 20 and went once when I was 19 and once more I went back at 20. I had a problem with opioids and other substances. I detoxed and haven’t used since. 

While there the doctor prescribed me medication and said I was manic depressive and they put me on meds. I took them for about 2 weeks and hated the way they made me feel. I haven’t used drugs for over 9 months now and believe that part of my life is over. 

I know they use a new system called GENESIS. So lying doesn’t work anymore (from what I’ve read on other Reddit posts) I am wondering if I’m wasting both the recruiters and my time. 

I already signed all the paperwork and said I have NO medical history because that’s what I was told to do by older service members. The paperwork is already being processed and I should hear back in 2-3 days. Not going to bother asking for a waiver because the marines already submitted my paperwork to MEPS.

,Army,"I hate it here. And by here I mean my MOS, 56M, Religious Affairs Specialist (Chap Ass for you older folks.) “ Oh but it’s such a cake job” or “it’s so easy.” You’re right! It’s easy. 

The most incompetent NCOs I’ve ever met are in the Chaplain Corp. Why am I working at BN lvl writing SOPs for the UMTs in the BDE? Division doesn’t even contact my BDE NCO. They just call me. This isn’t my first unit and this has happened several times because “SSG Incompetent isn’t very reliable and we see that the Lower Enlisted Mikes don’t respect them.” Then move them out of that slot and put me there tf. These same SSGs sit at E-6 and just fester. They don’t try to promote or make themselves competitive because it’s so easy to have a cake job and sit on their asses until they retire. I, for the life of me, cannot understand how somebody could just sit and be so comfortable not progressing. This shit is so mind boggling. Every meeting we have to go to it’s always “if you find a soldier that wants to be a 56M make sure they are a high achiever, competitive, and have good character!” Mean while we’re over here retaining Chap Asses that pop hot, never show up on time (if they show up,) and have absolutely 0 discipline. Not only that but they’re just fucking weird. Was talking to one of my MGs today and he was telling me how weird every chap ass he’s ever met is (he’s at my house hanging out pretty often so obviously I’m not too weird.) I was at ALC and we had to talk to the personnel management NCO for our branch and it’s always the same “recruit good soldiers” speech. I asked him why if we’re just going to retain all the shitty ones. I didn’t get an answer but I did get a counseling for saying “shitty” and lost my graduation honors (still had 3rd highest gpa.) 

I’ve never had a BDE 56M that was worth a damn. It’s me and 1 other SGT working at the bn level and they’ve never been in FORSCOM. They didn’t know how to set up their kit or even what a kit was referring to when I went over to introduce myself. Deadass looked down at their chevrons and told me they (the chevrons)  didn’t mean anything because they (the NCO) had no idea what they were doing. We have 3 PFCs and 2 SPCs in the rest of the BNs and so I try to do training that is actually practical and useful that also doesn’t involve just sitting and watching a power point because I know our SSG at BDE is 0% useful and doesn’t train or try to develop these younger 56Ms. I’ve given up on making SSG. My window opens at the end of the month and my retention is already pulling a list of MOSs to reclass to. 

Sorry for my long rant. I just left my BDE 56Ms office since they can’t answer a phone or respond to email.

Got to my new duty station, went to the ER, x-ray shows nothing. A month later, I get an MRI and it shows that my knee has loose bodies, a small fracture, and some ligament tearing. Swelling has gone down, but still visible after walking for periods of time. Have a referral for a CT and orthopedics.
I will be pushing 3 months on temp profile before I get the appointments.
My knee did pop before in April ‘22 during the field, but it self-resolved in a matter of just walking it off.

Got to my new duty station, went to the ER, x-ray shows nothing. A month later, I get an MRI and it shows that my knee has loose bodies, a small fracture, and some ligament tearing. Swelling has gone down, but still visible after walking for periods of time. Have a referral for a CT and orthopedics.
I will be pushing 3 months on temp profile before I get the appointments.
My knee did pop before in April ‘22 during the field, but it self-resolved in a matter of just walking it off. 
Just want to know if this sounds like surgery or anything. 😅
TIA

,USMC,"&gt;The Justice Department announced \[26dec23\] that is has secured a settlement against Billy Joe Goines, owner and operator of Goines Towing &amp; Recovery, based near Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, to resolve allegations that he violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) by towing and then selling vehicles without disclosing to the court that they were owned by servicemembers. \*\*\*  
&gt;  
&gt;In a complaint filed on March 3, the United States alleged that Goines auctioned off, sold or otherwise disposed of motor vehicles owned by eight servicemembers in violation of the SCRA, which provides a wide variety of financial and housing protections to members of the military. The SCRA requires a towing company to file an accurate affidavit stating whether the vehicle’s owner is in military service (i.e. a military affidavit) before it can get a court judgment authorizing it to sell a stored vehicle. If it appears that a vehicle’s owner is in military service, the court may not authorize the sale of the vehicle until it appoints an attorney to represent the interests of the servicemember. If that attorney then requests a postponement of the matter, the court must grant that request and postpone the case for at least 90 days.  The complaint here alleges that Goines either failed to file or filed inaccurate military affidavits with the court. Goines also allegedly filed military affidavits stating that he was unable to tell whether a vehicle owner was in the military even in instances where the vehicle at issue was towed from a military installation or had military decals, and instances when the vehicle owner or owner’s spouse had informed Goines of the owner’s active military service.\*\*\* [https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-north-carolina-based-towing-company-resolve-violations](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-north-carolina-based-towing-company-resolve-violations)

,USMC,"I was FAP'd out to the MPs at Cherry Point in 1998. One night one of my shift mates took me out to the grave site close to the PFT route across the road from the end of a flight line (if my memory is correct). A few of the 8 or 10 graves had the last name Buys which is an alternate spelling of my name Buijs. I always assumed they were distant relatives of my mom's family from her small town in the Netherlands.   
I just googled the graves and found out the eldest of the deceased was indeed born in the Netherlands.  Her married name  Brandt is the same as an uncle who married an aunt of mine - so possibly related on that side too.

One night one of my shift mates took me out to the grave site close to the PFT route across the road from the end of a flight line (if my memory is correct). A few of the 8 or 10 graves had the last name Buys which is an alternate spelling of my name Buijs. I always assumed they were distant relatives of my mom&amp;#39;s family from her small town in the Netherlands.&lt;br/&gt;
I just googled the graves and found out the eldest of the deceased was indeed born in the Netherlands.  Her married name  Brandt is the same as an uncle who married an aunt of mine - so possibly related on that side too.&lt;br/&gt;

,USMC,"(I will spare you all pics of my ripped, tight, 57 year old body and just give the advice)

**Getting Fit: An Overview**

**Four levers to pull:**

**Training**: this is where you force adaptations in your body to get stronger, gain endurance, etc.

**Nutrition**: this is where you fuel that magnificent beast of a body and lose fat

**Activity**: this is where you stop dying early and help burn calories

**Sleep**: this helps your body recover and benefit from the other levers

**Training**: Try and get in at least one session a week of those four kinds of training:

* *Strength*: this could be barbells or machines at a gym, or pushups, pullups, and air squats at home. It could be Pilates or power yoga—anything where you are doing sets of movement that push your muscles. Don’t stress over particular programs, set/reps, etc. If you do 3-5 “hard sets” (like maybe you had another 1-2 movements in you), for basic movements like squatting down/picking things up, pushing away, pulling towards, lunging forward/sideways, and twisting, you will get stronger.
* *Cardio/Zone 2:* jogging, rucking, powewalking, biking, etc. Half an hour at a moderate pace, like 60-70% of your max heart rate (220-age). Don’t go too hard or you miss the benefit! This is your base of your endurance.
* *Metabolic/HIIT*: bursts of activity that are close to maximal: skipping rope, elliptical, sprinting, etc. The goal is to get your heartrate up very high for working sets, with active recovery in between. I like 30 seconds work/1:30 active recovery. You could do 1 minute on/1 minute recovery, etc. But something like an 8-9 on a scale of 1-10 for work, and then drop to a 5-6 for the recovery period.
* *Mobility*: just go to youtube and find a 20-30 minute routine you like (Julia Reppel and Tom Morrison are good).

**Nutrition**: This can be overwhelming, and in a culture where we are surrounded by tons of crappy food. Some manageable suggestions:

Focus on getting in good food. When you eat high quality food, you will be less likely to eat crap. Also, good fuel will help you train, recover, and improve your body.

*Eat whole foods instead of processed foods; cook as much as you can instead of take-out*. Think of Panera and McDonalds as poison dispensaries; fruit juice, granola bars, breakfast cereals, store-bought muffins, breads, and cakes are all pretty much posion. Poison, poison, poison. Replacing poison with nuts, drinking milk, searing proteins like fish and chicken, eggs, cheese, broccoli/Brussel sprouts/cabbage, etc. is a huge move in the right direction.

*Don’t kid yourself*: it doesn’t matter what some calorie counter/TDEE website says. Over the course of a week, scales aren’t informative, but over the course of months they are. If you are not gaining muscle and want to, add a small portion of food daily. If you are not losing fat and to, cut out a small portion of food daily. Reassess every two weeks and cut/add as needed.

*Cut out some obvious crap*: empty-calorie drinks like soda or caramel-frappalacho iced vente w/ extra pump+cream, potatoe chips/fries, ice-cream, etc. Set a boundary you can follow, e.g. you will have 2-scoops of ice cream once on the weekend, a peppermint latte w/ extra sprinkles. The important thing is to identify something clear you can cut out to reduce calories in (assuming you want to loose fat)—“eat less” will never work, but cutting out the mid-AM hostess snack cake daily will.

*If you drink alcohol, consider setting clear bounds to reduce consumption*, e.g. if you have a couple beers most nights, set a clear rule that you will only have 3 beers total Fri-Sat.

**Activity**: very simply, a sedentary lifestyle is deadly. Every hour you spend on the couch watching Netflix chips away at your life and health, while every hour walking/gardening/doing chores/playing with your kids is life-extending/improving. Find a way to move more often: go for a 30 min walk after dinner.

**Sleep:** Find a way to get in sleep: a cool room, no lights, calm before you go to bed, no using the bed for anything other than sleeping (and makin’ whoopee), regular bedtime—whatever it takes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Fit: An Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four levers to pull:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;: this is where you force adaptations in your body to get stronger, gain endurance, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;: this is where you fuel that magnificent beast of a body and lose fat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activity&lt;/strong&gt;: this is where you stop dying early and help burn calories&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;: this helps your body recover and benefit from the other levers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;: Try and get in at least one session a week of those four kinds of training:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strength&lt;/em&gt;: this could be barbells or machines at a gym, or pushups, pullups, and air squats at home. It could be Pilates or power yoga—anything where you are doing sets of movement that push your muscles. Don’t stress over particular programs, set/reps, etc. If you do 3-5 “hard sets” (like maybe you had another 1-2 movements in you), for basic movements like squatting down/picking things up, pushing away, pulling towards, lunging forward/sideways, and twisting, you will get stronger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cardio/Zone 2:&lt;/em&gt; jogging, rucking, powewalking, biking, etc. Half an hour at a moderate pace, like 60-70% of your max heart rate (220-age). Don’t go too hard or you miss the benefit! This is your base of your endurance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metabolic/HIIT&lt;/em&gt;: bursts of activity that are close to maximal: skipping rope, elliptical, sprinting, etc. The goal is to get your heartrate up very high for working sets, with active recovery in between. I like 30 seconds work/1:30 active recovery. You could do 1 minute on/1 minute recovery, etc. But something like an 8-9 on a scale of 1-10 for work, and then drop to a 5-6 for the recovery period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mobility&lt;/em&gt;: just go to youtube and find a 20-30 minute routine you like (Julia Reppel and Tom Morrison are good).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;: This can be overwhelming, and in a culture where we are surrounded by tons of crappy food. Some manageable suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on getting in good food. When you eat high quality food, you will be less likely to eat crap. Also, good fuel will help you train, recover, and improve your body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eat whole foods instead of processed foods; cook as much as you can instead of take-out&lt;/em&gt;. Think of Panera and McDonalds as poison dispensaries; fruit juice, granola bars, breakfast cereals, store-bought muffins, breads, and cakes are all pretty much posion. Poison, poison, poison. Replacing poison with nuts, drinking milk, searing proteins like fish and chicken, eggs, cheese, broccoli/Brussel sprouts/cabbage, etc. is a huge move in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t kid yourself&lt;/em&gt;: it doesn’t matter what some calorie counter/TDEE website says. Over the course of a week, scales aren’t informative, but over the course of months they are. If you are not gaining muscle and want to, add a small portion of food daily. If you are not losing fat and to, cut out a small portion of food daily. Reassess every two weeks and cut/add as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cut out some obvious crap&lt;/em&gt;: empty-calorie drinks like soda or caramel-frappalacho iced vente w/ extra pump+cream, potatoe chips/fries, ice-cream, etc. Set a boundary you can follow, e.g. you will have 2-scoops of ice cream once on the weekend, a peppermint latte w/ extra sprinkles.

tw: drugs mention, suicide mention

i have been under a lot of stress lately with the holidays passing and feeling as though nobody loves me due to having no more biological family left due to my fathers suicide and my mothers abandonment of me. now my job is causing me distress because who knows, i just feel the need to quit a job after 3 months despite everything going semi fine besides simple work drama. i am dependent on drugs and never show up sober to my job anyhow because i have no care for if i get fired or not. i called out sick the past 2 days for my mental health and don’t feel sad, just like if i talk to someone i will eat their face off.

my moods have been so unhinged lately despite appearing normal from the outside, i have started 3 bullet journals, a tarot tracker, learning 2 languages, and go to the gym for 1+ hr everyday (more than usual). yet despite all these “manic” behaviors, i feel like garbage and have no motivation to actually complete any regular tasks in my day to day life. i feel so utterly alone with how i feel, people only understand depression.

my psychiatrist prescribed me wellbutrin and i started it today to help with my motivation problems. i am an anxious mess wondering if the side effects will send me over the edge because of how weird and dysphoric i have felt. i have a history of akathisia from abilify.

,bipolar,"As a 44 year old white guy married with 2 kids who has had bipolar all his life, this past few months I have been neck deep in some of the worst depression I've had in my life, in so much that its not necessarily a product of manic depression (but it is, but I've been far worse conditions due to delusions and mania coupled with the depression.  But this is just pure depression it seems.  I feel like such an asshole because I can't feel happiness with my kid.  My family has no idea what I'm going through and I certainly don't want them to know.  I smile at my kids and maintain status quo but inside I feel nothing and am even more depressed that I can't get joy from simply being a good father.  I feel like I have pretty much spent my life up already.  There's not going to be good years ahead in so much as they were already in the past.  I feel older, my body's older, its not in the same shape as it used to be and I'm deteriorating.  Some people have it much worse than me, and I don't know how they get through the day.  I feel I am spoiled, which is why I'm depressed about crap that genuinely physically unhealthy people deal with every day but seem to just brush it off.    


Anyways, time goes by so slowly throughout the day.  It was a few months ago that I loved my job, was kicking all sorts of ass with it.  It was all due to my mania I had over the summer.  Now its over and the opposite is kicked in and I can't stand my job anymore.  Its changed, its my perception, and its my disorder.  I can't stand doing much anything anymore.  Its all so trite and meaningless it seems.  The whole everything, work every day to pay bills that will allow me to get to work every day and take care of my family.  Yes I know I need to keep going for them, but then again I feel I am a fraud.  Do I feel anything anymore?  I don't think I've been a good dad recently, a good anything recently.  I'm filled with suffering, suffering through each second with death or disappearing from everything would be so much better than enduring this constant distaste for life.    


I try to play guitar and thats fine but its also work, hard work.  I'm lacking motiviation.  I still do my job.  I just want to lay in bed and look at nothing until a fall asleep and temporarily seem to stop existing.  I don't enjoy anything the way I used to and its taking its toll on me.  I've had so many interests in my life, so many promises, so much potential, so much enthusiasm, and now its gone.  Just like you guys I struggle every day right now.  I want to go up to my coworkers and ask them what they fuck gets them through the day to get through this bullshit society day in and day out, but it won't matter.  They play their video games, they have their family, they have their forms of self improvement.  I have mine, but it doesn't even matter, what for?   Perhaps I'm in a midlife existential crisis.  I don't want to get older.  Don't have much of a choice.  I Feel trapped. Wondering how long this episode will last?  Can't shake this mood I'm in and the mood I'm in is backed up by real logical existential philosophy too that goes through my head regularly now.

,bipolar,"Hi all,

I was diagnosed with bipolar II in June 2023. Took about 15 years to get an accurate diagnosis. I'm still learning how to handle the highs and lows. I had a good 3 months of stable mood but recently had a hypomanic episode and now I'm in a low. It's not a severe low, but I can't seem to get myself to do anything at work. The last 3 months I've been working great and feeling good, so it's a huge bummer to be back to doing nothing. 

My question is, how do you all deal with your symptoms at work? Do you push through the days until you feel better, or do you take sick time? I'm at a point where I'm not accomplishing anything at work, but I feel guilty taking time off. At the same time, I feel guilty sitting here not doing much.

,bipolar,"So, the thing is, I have been getting mental health support with psychologists and psychiatrists for more than 3 years. But it seems no one really gets what's going on. I would really appreciatte if you could read and tell me if you either feel like this or if you have an idea of what it might be.

I spent the past 3 years under investigation because everyone thought I might be bipolar. However, I never had a manic or hypomanic crises that resulted in any 'loss"", such as I never cheated on anyone, never spent an enourmous amount of money, etc. So they could never say for sure that this was my problem. 

However, what really happens to me is that I cannot stand my life as it is, without any changes, for longer than 6 months. I start to feel depressed when I see nothing is new and everyday starts to feel like shit (sounds like a regular depressive episode so far). It makes me feel so awful and suffocated that I even consider dropping everything and starting a new life again at some other place, some other job, some new people. However, it's not financially viable for me. And the longer I stay in this situation the worst the depression gets.

But the thing is that this always happens and If I cannot trigger a major change in my life within this period, I will most probably spoil everything like, get fired, end a relationship,etc. Just because I think this is not interesting anymore, and convince myself that the life I really want is somewhere else. 

I want to point that the most important thing is that the feeling I have is not just a normal ""boredom"" feeling, I feel actually suffocated, like as if I am drowning emotionally, and that's why I start to become kinda impulsive and want to run away to start a new life or something like that - which I did some times and that made me really happy for maximum 6 months (sounds like a maniac episode), and then the cycle starts again.

Like someone moved everything a few inches to the left, even the air. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to understand my mania better because I’ve never been great at recognizing when it’s happening or looking back and realizing that’s what was happening at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

***this post might be all over the place because of how my brain runs lol***
I’ve recently started to spiral into a manic episode due to my stressful job. Few important notes, I’m not medicated for my bipolar, only for my adhd and my stressful job is serving at a very very high volume sports venue/restaurant.
Alright so, I was diagnosed bipolar while I was a teenager- I was probably 16 yrs old. I’m now 28. It does run in the family. I have in the past been prescribed meds but at the time didn’t like how they made me feel or they just didn’t seem to work. I’ve been on vyvanse for my adhd for about 5 years now and honestly I think it helps a lot with my impulse control when it comes to decision making and keeping me goal oriented, which does wonders for me bc I need structure, as do most of us who struggle with bipolar. Does anyone have any helpful tips or tricks on how to manage their emotions naturally during a manic episode? I’ve kind of just been raw dogging this illness (by choice) but am losing my grip/footing on how to keep the drastic emotions in check at times. I as a person can pick up on things that trigger my anxiety &amp; mania and know when an episode is coming on and I know rationally that my thinking and emotions are distorted, but I just wanna hear other ways people combat their ups and downs on their own.

And yes I know therapy and medication will do me wonders, I’m getting there..I get anxiety when it comes to sitting down and selecting the right therapist and then having to find time in my chaotic and constantly changing work schedule. And maybe I’m dragging my feet and making excuses bc it’s easier than leaving my comfort zone and taking the leap or getting help.

,bipolar,"may contain trigger warnings like religious traumas,,, ig

I'm Southeast Asian, and a lot of SEA parents have ample to no knowledge about dealing with mental health at all. My mom is one of those people who would believe in voodoo and also be a roman catholic at the same time. She's also old enough to be fooled by those ""cure all"" medicines and ointments, and I'm the very opposite of her (considering that she's in her 60s and I'm in my early 20s), whereas I would hyper-fixate on researching about important stuff (to me, at least). 

Long story short, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder I, after missing my long term quiz, and ultimately found a doctor to give me a medical certificate, and prescriptions. She's not very familiar with the term and she had been viewing me as someone who was rude and moody, not until my diagnosis. 

It was very endearing that she was worrying about me at first. I got to tell her that it had been really long since I was feeling this way (u know,,, depresso and mania) and it wasn't just a one time thing. I was suffering silently ever since highschool and I'm aware of that (I'm in college now). And I was scared to let her know about this because I KNOW she won't take it very well and I KNOW that she's going to try various unresearched thing that claims to ""cure"" people of their said illness. The first few days, she had been following exactly what my doctor told us. NOT UNTIL she contacted her **Dentist** (in bold to emphasize the ridiculousness of the situation) who she claims to know more than what their doctorate degree indicates. She basically booked an appointment with that dentist for me. 

The Dentist made this ""Healing"" Therapy with me (which costs just as much as a real therapy) . Upon seeing their office and clinic, it was clear that they're also very religious given the amount of Jesus-es I've seen. Don't get me wrong, I'd rather let my mom take me to a church and ask the priest to exorcise the hell out of my depression than this weird dentist thing, disinforming my mom about mental health and medications - which, given my luck, didn't happen. 

My mom now believes that everything that my Psych doctor told me is a scheme, intentionally making their patients worse so they could come back to them. I think it's ridiculous that she finds that healing therapy stuff more helpful than a doctor with years of expertise with this stuff, ALL because this weirdass dentist discredited psychiatrists. (TW: &gt;!They basically claimed that my anti-psychotics would make me depend on it and make me feel a lot worse. She then referred to hollywood artists committing s-word because of ""good ol western medicine""!&lt;)

My mom, in turn, made me stop taking my meds (anti-psychotics) and this had made me go back to not sleeping on time with racing thoughts as usual. She's planning to book another appointment with this mojo dentist. This has been making my mental health spiral down again seeing that we're also struggling with money, yet she's choosing to make me go to this clown. She's eager to make me go because she apparently was promised that my mood disorder would go away in a few sessions. 

I'd rather let her take me to go seek Jesus in my life with devotees praying for me, than seek a silent therapy where the dentist would just put her hands on me and make me close my eyes. It's the same thing but free (without any taxes as well).

I apologize for the long post. I love my mom, but this is just ridiculous.

,bipolar,"Hi, 

Sorry for the strange title I couldn't really describe what I'm talking about in such a short title.

I am autistic and have bipolar 2. I am currently an inpatient because I reached my limit and broke. 

Today in group therapy we were talking about critical internal monologues, you know your own voice that just hounds you and smashes you with negative self talk, ""you're dumb/fat/worthless/useless"", ""you should just do it, noone will miss you"" etc. 

In this group I felt comfortable and confident to speak up about my experience. And I asked if everyone also heard the other voices as well - those of loved ones, partners, exes, friends, bullies, etc, where you here some of the critical and shit things they've said ""you're not good enough"", ""noone could love you"", ""you're fucking crazy"", ""you're worthless and won't amount to anything"", ""you deserve to be alone"". And if everyone visualises these interactions at the same time.

I found out, that's a resounding ""no"", that this was not normal. Which was qualified further that it is especially not normal to ""see"" the interactions, or feel the sensations of touch or bodily senses of a tug at heart, dropping subject etc, even smell and taste.

I clarified that I don't hear or see these things as hallucinations but in my ""minds eye"" so to speak.

,bipolar,"I've currently been on Caplyta 42 mg for 3 months and Ativan 0.5 mg PRN for 2 weeks. I've been doing really well with my motivation coming back, but only with my preferred tasks, like my hobby writing, reading, watching my favorite shows, etc. I've also been able to continue to go to work throughout my depressive cycles, so no changes there, except that maybe it feels easier and I don't feel quite as burnt out about it. 

Yesterday, I had another appointment with my psychiatrist to see how the Ativan was helping with my sleep, and it was going well, so I told her that, but then she asked me if I felt that it was working too well. I get that she has to ask, but I felt that the answer was already implied because I had already told her that I only used it 4-5 nights, only on nights that I absolutely had to sleep because I had work, and not even every night I had work because some nights I already felt tired and ready to crash so I didn't feel as though I needed it. 

Then we started talking about my ADLs. I'd been working on them for months with my therapist with no real progress, so I wanted to bring it up with my psychiatrist for her opinion, especially since she brought up adding an antidepressant last time but then decided against it. My psychiatrist is a resident, so she left to go talk to the attending, and when they came back, they talked to me about adding either Strattera or Effexor and launched into this explanation about how being able to do preferred tasks but struggling with nonpreferred tasks could be indicative of ADHD. My psychiatrist wouldn't tell me her thoughts until I told her mine first, and I told her I was leaning more toward Strattera, but then I feel like I might have over-explained and gave too many reasons why??

I also have a background as a pharmacy technician that they know about, so I don't know if that makes a difference. 

I also specifically used the words ""non-preferred tasks"" when I talked about my issues with my ADLs before they themselves did in regards to ADHD, but I was a TSS before who worked with kids with autism with that being common wording in treatment plans, so it's just part of my vocabulary now.

But because of all of this combined, and the fact that my psychiatrist smiled to herself when I said I was thinking Strattera, I'm worried that they think I'm drug-seeking or something now. My psychiatrist even said something about a low-dose of Adderall before going to talk to the attending and asked me about changing around the frequency of how often I'd need the Ativan. I feel like I'm being tested and I don't like it. I'm feeling pretty anxious, like I'm walking a tightrope with my own psych team.

Has anyone else ever run into this? Were you being tested to see if you were drug-seeking or does it just always feel this way when it comes to these types of drugs?

,bipolar,"MY QUESTIONS: **Does Mania Present The Same For Everyone?** and **Can Other Conditions Morph The Way Ones Bipolar Presents?**

I recently got assessed for Bipolar Disorder, and received a diagnosis for Bipolar 2. 

During my assessment the psychiatrist mentioned something that struck me, she described mania as ‘running around naked in the street’ (as an example). 

For context, I’ve also got severe complex trauma (CPTSD) &amp; OCD, and have been in a constant state of some sort of depersonalisation since I was little (and it got a lot worse in 2023). I’m anxiety ridden and barely leave my house, and I don’t know how to talk to people. The psychiatrist said I matched the criteria for agoraphobia, but attributed it to my CPTSD.

Reflecting on how my mania/hypomania manifests, I feel like my symptoms aren’t always so stereotypical (in the way my psychiatrist described it). For example, I know I’m manic when I start spending all my savings on hair products and skin care in one sitting, when the voices and images in my head become more chaotic and almost hallucinatory, AND OTHER MORE SEVERE ACTIVITIES THAT I DON’T FEEL LIKE SHARING PUBLICLY LOL. 

I’m very organised, and non-impulsive to my core (I spend weeks doing research on an item, regardless of worth, before I buy it etc), but this goes out the window (to a point obviously) when I’m manic/hypomanic.

I’m a very self-aware and extremely sensitive person due to my complex trauma (I’ve also been told by a psychotherapist to get assessed for autism), so I tend to completely isolate from everyone when I’m having any episode (in relation to my bipolar).",t2_16ep52r3,False,,0,False,DOES MANIA PRESENT THE SAME FOR EVERYONE?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18y9gz5,False,light,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Support/Advice :shy:,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1704361923.0,richtext,,,,text,self.bipolar,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;MY QUESTIONS: &lt;strong&gt;Does Mania Present The Same For Everyone?&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Can Other Conditions Morph The Way Ones Bipolar Presents?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"Hi all!

So in the past several months, almost all of my very serious symptoms have disappeared- symptoms that have been present since I was a child. But they've also come with me sleeping 12+ hrs a day, falling asleep at work or while doing things, and having extreme disassociave panic episodes. Nightly delusions I've been having since I could remember? Gone, mostly. I think I've had maybe one unnerved episode, and one proper psychotic symptoms episode that went away within the hour. Mania? Vanished. Major depressive episodes? I've had a single one that wasn't directly triggered by anything.

I have an appointment coming up to request a brain scan, just to make sure nothing is seriously wrong, since my symptoms have been pretty standard since 14, and worsening since 19 (I'm 24 now). I know I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth, but I figured it's better to be sure.

&lt;p&gt;So in the past several months, almost all of my very serious symptoms have disappeared- symptoms that have been present since I was a child. But they&amp;#39;ve also come with me sleeping 12+ hrs a day, falling asleep at work or while doing things, and having extreme disassociave panic episodes. Nightly delusions I&amp;#39;ve been having since I could remember? Gone, mostly. I think I&amp;#39;ve had maybe one unnerved episode, and one proper psychotic symptoms episode that went away within the hour. Mania? Vanished. Major depressive episodes? I&amp;#39;ve had a single one that wasn&amp;#39;t directly triggered by anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an appointment coming up to request a brain scan, just to make sure nothing is seriously wrong, since my symptoms have been pretty standard since 14, and worsening since 19 (I&amp;#39;m 24 now). I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t look a gift horse in the mouth, but I figured it&amp;#39;s better to be sure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I&amp;#39;m also losing my state insurance next month. I don&amp;#39;t know that I&amp;#39;ll be able to get the scan done at all. So wish me luck, if you can.

,bipolar,"When do you know you need to go to the hospital?

Hi there. I’ve been diagnosed since 2017. I had to make some med adjustments last summer and fall due to the med I was on causing tardive dyskinesia. I tried a med that came out in 2019 and it did not work at all. I regressed to having active (bad thing) ideation, mood dysregulation and severe depression. I have been having periods of one night every couple of weeks that I haven’t been able to sleep since that med change. It culminated Christmas weekend with me being up for three days. Currently I have been awake since I woke up Monday morning. Christmas week we discontinued my mood stabilizer (after doubling the dose) and raised the med I’ve been on since 2017 from 1200mg to 1500mg. The first three days after raising the dose I vomited within twenty minutes of taking my medications so I effectively didn’t take my medications for three days. The plan was to continue on the increased dose until my appointment on the 18th and then assess for the need of a replacement mood stabilizer. Obviously, I am calling my clinician first thing in the morning. I just wondered if some of you might share your own lived experiences with when you have made (or would make) the decision to go to the hospital for inpatient med stabilization. 

This is obviously effecting my daily life at home and at work. I just started my job in December and I don’t feel good about med trials to find the right medication.

,bipolar,"So I’ve been diagnosed bipolar for 14 years, although I’m pretty sure there was about 10 before that. Just over the years I’ve started having stronger delusions. My first strong one was that I was immortal. Right now it’s that I’m part of a simulation and my forgetfulness is when something is reset. They’ve always manifested while I was manic, but this time I’m in a down spiral. The life is a simulation one happens the most commonly. One of my tricks with that is to chat with a friend of mine who is completely unpredictable. Her unpredictability shows me that at least she is not a simulation, which helps me to dig my way out. Simulations are predictable but real life isn’t. Right now she’s having a lot of issues of her own and just doesn’t have the spoons to help me, which I am completely understanding of.

She was my best friend, and my only friend. Everyone else tends to leave me because of how unbearable I am to be around. I wish I knew about the symptoms of bipolar earlier so that I could have been more aware. (Again, not an excuse. But it could have helped me a little.)

This journey has been interrupted multiple times by hospitalizations/ECT/treatment.

,bipolar,"Hi everyone, 

I was reading Heart Stopper tonight, and somehow I started crying. I started crying because I never had a friend group like that when I was in my teens. I did not get the normal teenage experience because I was severely mentally ill and I had undiagnosed autism. I had no friends, I did not get invited to parties, and I had an unstable home life.

It was literally my dream to have a friend group like that, or to have a girl best friend. I never got it, and I spent countless weekends alone while I got to watch everyone go to parties, dates, and get togethers. 

I feel really behind in some areas because I didn't get the socialization I needed for certain areas like friendships and serious relationships. 

 I'm 23 years old now, and I'm attempting to go back to school after dropping out last spring due to mental illness. I was not on the right medication, and I was discriminated at an internship interview. The sad part about that is I was suppose to graduate last spring, and all my hard work and pushing through went in the trash. 

I only made two friends in college, but the sad thing is that I see their Instagram stories of them going to concerts, bars, and the movies with other friends. I never get invited to anything. I get so lonely sometimes, and I don't know if I should cry or scream. 

I had to accept a lot of thing last year. I had to accept that I lost the life I wanted. I had to rethink on what my life was going to look like. I had to come to terms that I will have to work twice as hard as my peers just to get half way. I will have to find a way to build a freelance career and I have no idea how to start. I will also be in therapy for the rest of my life just to manage all three of my conditions. I will have to take meds that taste like a dogs butt for the rest of my life.

,bipolar,"Hello everyone,

Yes, I wrote this and then used AI to restructure it to sound less like a rant. I hope you’re all doing well. I’m a 23-year-old male, soon to be 24, with bipolar 2, who, 7-8 months ago, moved 800 miles across the country from New Jersey to southeast Georgia with my girlfriend. To provide some context, I worked in a cozy IT desk job for two years that accommodated my bipolar disorder very well. However, six months ago, I took a leap and left that job to move out of my grandparent’s home, and things have been quite challenging since then.

I don’t have a degree and carry about $30,000 in credit card/loan debt. Despite diligently applying to hundreds of jobs daily and seeking guidance from over 10+ IT and recruiting professionals to refine my resume, securing stable employment has been a struggle. My job history post-relocation includes a few low-level retail positions and one promising enterprise IT job, which I quit due to increased cycling in my bipolar disorder.

Unfortunately, I’ve found it hard to maintain jobs. Whether it’s unsuitable work environments or my reluctance to work excessive hours (55-65 hours a week), I’ve either quit or been let go. Presently, I’m in a relatively low-stress retail job, but the owner’s micromanagement exacerbates my rapid cycling, making it difficult to manage my health (yes, I have spoken to him about it, but he has a business to run and as accommodating as he has have been, he has made that very clear.)

Speaking of health, while I’ve historically managed my bipolar disorder well, since leaving the job where I felt content, finding work stability has been a challenge. I’m currently on Vraylar, and my therapist is suggesting that I consider applying for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) due to the worsening of my condition. However, I have reservations as I’ve only made a modest income (30-40K) in the past 5-6 years I have been working and worry about the viability of disability support.

Financially, my girlfriend and I collectively face monthly expenses of $1300 each for rent and food, in addition to my credit card debt. My therapist believes there are potential benefits to applying for Supplemental Security Income (SSI), even though my contributions to it have been limited due to my income.

At this juncture, I’m torn between seeking disability benefits for additional support and continuing the job search in hopes of finding a role that accommodates my health needs while ensuring financial stability. My grandfather suggests holding off on disability claims and persisting in finding a job that aligns better with my health.

I’m reaching out here seeking advice and insights. Should I explore disability benefits despite my financial concerns or focus on finding a job that better suits my health condition and financial needs?

,bipolar,"I (25FtM) was diagnosed Bipolar 1 about a year ago and I haven't enrolled in classes in almost two years.  I was enrolled in classes last spring but ended up taking a medical leave of absence when I got my diagnosis. I'm applying for disability accommodation, but I'm not sure what to ask for. I'm stuck just on the question on the form: ""How does your disability impact your academic progress?"" I've always been really bad at asking for help when I need it. I was always raised to tough it out and not make ""excuses"", which clearly wasn't working. I know I can't do it alone anymore.

I haven't been in school since before my bipolar diagnosis and I still am having a hard time identifying what my moods mean and what I need, let alone knowing how to ask for help or knowing how it will affect me in school. I'm still adjusting medications too.

I've always struggled with finishing classes. I'd enroll in a major and then lose momentum a couple of months in, fail the classes, then change my major again. I also have unmedicated ADHD, so it was probably a bit of that and the undiagnosed bipolar affecting me. I've probably taken about 180 credits worth of classes between 5 majors. I have 71 credits and an A.A. to show for it.

I just want to know what kind of accommodations you guys have asked for and/or which ones really helped you the most. Or have any of you struggled with asking for help, too? Are there things at home that really helped you with school?

I'm enrolled at an online school, so I don't have any in-person lectures, which is nice. The classes are 8-week sessions instead of 16 weeks, so I can enroll in 2 classes at a time rather than 5. I like that structure a lot more than trying to study for 5 midterm/finals at the same time.

I don't have much of a support system in terms of family, they don't understand the concept of mental health very much, but I have close friends who try their best to understand and be supportive. They have mental health struggles of their own that weigh on them enough. We all try to be supportive of each other, but sometimes we just need to not talk about that stuff at all.

If you're having a tough time right now, even just observing the patterns in your mood and behaviour is helpful in the long run. after each episode (or during if you're capable of that) try to think were there any things that triggered it, and was there any behaviour that prolonged it.

People around would confirm I'm calm and ready to act if anything and I condone violence in any way shape or form.

I am F25 and have been diagnosed with MDD and GAD during the very young adulthood (should have been since childhood but whatever). Oh well 2 months ago I have been diagnosed bipolar actually and cptsd/adhd maybe, still in evaluation Idk. 

I always have been a crier. I cry when there is a overwhelming feeling. And oh boy during depression I cry my soul my heart my body out until possibly I enter deplition. Indeed I have experienced until now irritability to be increased especially when the depression was extremly severe but I always pointed it to depression symptom. Here irritability meant FcK I can't concentrate I am so angry, fck I can't read, fck there is to much noise here arghhhh, fck I cannot anymore cope with my emotions so easily I get internally angry. That's the thing. Internally. I did process it into sadness (angry is s secondary emotion and it's always about smth else, most of the time sadness to agony) and I cried as I was saying. Also I'm female and it is more socially acceptable Ig, plus in my environment I could never afford to manifest angryness cause it was too risky for everyone. And still is. 

I attempted suicide one time, right before I got any diagnosis, and I got so effin scared afterwards. Why? Because I couldn't rationally believe I would do such a thing! I felt so invalidated to the point I actually made myself believe I did not attempt it, just because I had never heard at that point of smth similar, only people planning their suicides or at least wanting to die badly. I mean yes, I did had plans at some point, and still want to die (currently in a severe mixed ep) but still I have enough control to understand that it's only my mind playing tricks on me or so I like to call it. Obvsly I was always psych educated. Now I know it's the manic features of a mixed episode that make me 'desperate to die' so to say, impulsive enough to not think through. As you can see it also was hard for me to see because all my life I thought of me as the most non-impulsive person ever lol. Plus, I am a effin psychologist and it was I swear to god impossible for me to see more than depression and maybe some postraumatic stress for myself always. No matter how much you know it is so terribly hard to see hypomania or mania for what it is. Especially when it always comes so masked and interwind for me. I am lucky enough I came out truthfully to my NEW psychistrist to things I have done (because just a tiny bit I was starting to suspect smth more is up but wouldn't accept it/couldn't point my finger on it). If I didn't I probably be hospitalized rn or dead, or anything but still not diagnosed bipolar. 

Anyways, I always knew I had some unexpressed anger and I should rejoin sports. But I also am coming out of severe burn out and never got the time or energy for that. I did many times feel like I just wanna effin scream in the woods or legit anywhere if possible. What I'm saying is that I did feel the rage but I always managed to push it through. 

But man 2 months ago I broke a window at my house with my palm because of rage. I swear I couldn't think straight. I ONLY saw black before my eyes. That's when I knew shit hit the fan. Also I was 5 days sleepless at that point because every second of night my mind was racing how I should end it. That's when I was lucky and rational enough to call an emergency app with a new doc as I was saying, he gave me smth so I don't need to go to the ER but it is sooooooooooooooooooooooo hard. 

I cannot believe the rage I can feel. I am annoyed by literally anything ever. My boyfriend chewing gets me hyperventilating in a separate room so I do not scream at him. I walk the streets and I literally think omg I wanna punch somebody I wanna just punch all these parked cars. Now I realize my teen self-harm was out of impulsive rage too, because I still feel so badly I wanna do it. I try everything, the ribber bands, the cold/hot showers, breathing, meditation (hahhahahaah) etc. I swear I can't put into words this rage. I knew about it from books and cases especially I know it's associated with time in jail especially for males with bipolar but I never thought this was possible!!!!! I still cry my ass out but I also am SO ANGRY!!!! :)

,bipolar,"First of all, it is great to find a community like this🤗
I don’t normally care about people judging me, but I do feel a lot of shame. I tried applying the methods I am learning in therapy but in this case it just doesn’t work and I cringe so hard plus intrusive thoughts. Been seeing for 1.5 years someone who has avoidant attachment style, narcissistic and gaslighter.

2. when i’m full-blown manic, every day for months i wake up in the morning feeling extremely high and go to bed feeling the same way. it feels kinda like being on stimulants, but way more than that. that’s the closest i can describe the feeling. i grind my teeth, move my jaw, and stuff like that. i also feel an orgasm feeling in my forehead that lasts for hours at a time and it feels good at first but it kinda turns into a headache after awhile when it doesn’t stop. i can’t sleep, jittery, on edge, nauseous from lack of wanting to eat, headaches, my muscles are tense from being so wired, etc etc

,bipolar,"After a friend cut me out of her life this past week, I have been doing exceptionally not well. Our last talk/fight basically ended with me falling apart as she broke down how much of a burden I was and just stressed her out, then me pressuring her to block me online so I couldn't reach out again and ranting about how much she never liked, cared about or wanted me. I felt some ideations again and cried when she told me she didn't want to be my friend anymore because it's too stressful. She blocked me.

This person calls me only a friend, but our relationship was always shifting and ambiguous. Our interaction was never fully platonic, often turned sexual, she was basically living here for months, texting all day every day, almost all social activities were together, she'd call me her partner for awhile, then we'd have a fight and she'd claim we were never together, or that I was never a contender for her partner, on and on. She has since pushed this idea that I was only ever some sort of fix-it project and nothing else, leading me to question the reality of things between us. She is herself autistic.

I thought I was making a lot of progress and seeing improvement on 100mg of Lamotrigine. Most of her behavior stopped triggering me at all. After some work stuff went sour and they revoked my ability to work from home, my boss said I didn't conceptually understand the job, then she and I had a fight a couple days later, where she came at me about how I confuse her so much that spending time with me makes her want to go cry in the car. I fell apart.

Since then, I met with my therapist on Weds to talk that over, then my PMHNP yesterday. We're increasing my dosage to 200mg and adding 150mg of Wellbutrin. It's been suggested I take a leave of absence from work and I finally submitted a request yesterday afternoon.

Has anyone done this and were there any issues ensuring you had enough money to survive during that time? I've asked for 3 weeks but am worried it's not enough or that I could lose my ability to live independently, and the stress and sadness and loss I'm trying to grapple with right now is feeling really overwhelming.

I wanted to know some other people’s experience with exercise and sleep. 

Exercise for me is one of the absolute key tools in maintaining my mental health, along with general healthy routine and trying to keep on top of healthy habits. I am super fortunate I can afford to exercise in a private gym, in small group sessions with a trainer who is adaptable and understanding. 

One thing I have always struggled with though is the impact that exercising, particularly HIIT or 1RM days, has on my sleep. I exercise in the afternoon so it’s never too close to bed time, and I try to do a lot of mindfulness and breath work in the evening to bring myself back down to earth a bit. Sometimes I can get to sleep ok but I find myself waking up a lot in the night and struggling to stay asleep. It seems to regularly make sleep a lot harder all round. 

I suppose I’m just wondering if anyone else has a similar issue and whether they’ve found anything else that really helps?

,schizophrenia,So my story is long. I fell into weed during college and briefly heard a demonic voice (like it was a growl then it was gone never to be heard again). I was possibly on adhd or depression meds so idk if that’s influences it. I also took a lot and drank often with it. It caused fear and I went to doctor and started Abilify. I continued to smoke quite heavily and eventually quit after it made me thinking I was dying constantly. During Covid stopped my medicine. I developed a weird obsessional crush on a coworker and made up a strange scenario and believed it after being rejected. I have issues with rejection and abandonment and I grew up isolated. I have adhd and autism. Got seveare anxiety and depression but it comes and goes and sometimes I take my meds. Anyways I have had some strange breakdowns. One where I thought my friends were talking about me years ago. It is unclear if they were or not.  And one where I was paranoid about one talking behind my back and I often listen by his door. Anyways fast forward I have hypochondriac like issue where I convince myself I’m sometimes dying with google. Most of the times I have symptoms but not I’m afraid they are real. I started dating my bf. Got back on antipsychotics. I was misdiagnosed with bipolar  when I smoked. I developed acute dystonia and had to suddenly stop. I got very paranoid about my relationship. We have issues of course anyways I was triggered by finding my friends underwear and I completely lost it. I have bits of clarity but on bad nights she stay over I would check the locks and think she’s in bathroom with him. I thought I saw her shadow in a video he once sent and saw a text from her  during all of this. All of which after I was able to clearly realize wasn’t true. Most at night or when I drank. I was going through the worst stress of my life. My doctors say it’s anxiety and autism but I can’t get over it. I look up symptoms and convinced I am developing it. My dad is bipolar and my family has lots of mental health issues anxiety being extreme. I had therapist tell me I was developing schizophrenia to the point I when I spiral I google and freak out and don’t leave my house. Once lasted a month. I’ve had fears like this with cancer and Lyme disease but knowing everything I know… I’m fucked… I wish I never touched weed. Im about to turn 25 when it shows up. I know I can’t prevent it if I were to develop it. But I feel so hopeless. Is there a chance my doctors are right and it’s just extreme anxiety and stress?

Does the human tailbone still wag? For the past 5 years I have been watching for it.

You can stimulate your tailbone to wag by wobbling your knee slightly for a second, stop it abruptly, and then watch for your tail to start wagging.

A wagging tail used to lead me down schizophrenic rabbit holes because it would make me dizzy while sitting still and I would associate it with voices.

Other wobbling, dizzy type visual hallucinations can come from: the center of the forehead, inner ear on either side, the vision of either eye, your musculoskeletal system, breathing.

Nervous gestures like crinkling a piece of paper in your pocket or twitching, movements that aren't accomplishing anything, those made while waiting, one makes these gestures in response to the tailbone and stifling its wobbling effects.

A natural tailbone wag occurs when you release adrenaline. Your size and any animals size controls how and when you get excited. Adrenaline can be a happy excitement or a fight or flight response. Adrenaline flight response is anxiety.

One useful trick to observe control over dizzy visual hallucinations is: stare at something for a good couple seconds, then turn your attention in your vision to something in your peripherals, after a second it may begin to wobble. You can move the wobbling around between objects by changing your minds attention to different objects in your vision. Focusing on nothing will make your whole vision wobble.

I really don't know what to do. It's been 3 years. Whenever I do a ""sinful behavior"" I feel agony in my chest (like I'm being crucified.) It's so real I feel like I'm being stabbed in the chest.

For instance, when I tried to have a romantic relationship I literally felt like I was dying I was in so much physical agony.

,schizophrenia,"This is a lot of rambling just to warn.

Last night was one of my worst sleeps, and yesterday thus had some of my worst cognitive and negative symptoms. I was just absolutely fucked. I was hoping for tonight to be different, but roommates messed with the thermostat again, woke to a 90 degree room out of a dead sleep after an hour and a half of struggling to sleep. I don't know how long I would've slept if I hadn't been woken up, but it was a damn good sleep. I'm old enough to know my body at this point; it would've been at least 3 hours. I got 3 hours last night. 

I don't know how I'm so capable of thinking right now. Likely because I'm so fucking wired from being triggered because my partner and I have explained again and again to these fuckwads, you turn the heat above 70 and our bedroom gets fucking unlivable, and we both are heat sensitive as hell. Literally over 90 degrees before the heat fucking shuts off, I'd sweat through my pajamas and my blanket was fucking soaked. At this point, I'm not even sure if me thinking our roommates wanna kill me is a fucking delusion or if they are. Disclaimer, it's uh probably a delusion. Idk, I'm also trans and they're kinda really against that, so it's hard to tell lmao I wonder why my paranoia keeps getting worse!!! I wonder!!! I fucking wonder!!! I don't want to talk about ""why I don't leave"" btw, I'm ignoring everyone that asks that even if you have other stuff in your comment. Don't ask that. Thinking about it will literally trigger me when I've finally started calming down, don't ask why I haven't left. 

I just want to sleep. I have literal trauma surrounding sleep aids but I'm desperate enough to try them again after 15 years. I'm already paranoid as hell (my worst positive symptom), I don't wanna think about my hallucinations really starting up again. The visual ones are manageable. The tactile ones, I'm literally terrified of getting those back bad again. It's always bugs. The visual ones are usually bugs now that I think about it actually. And I actually have yet to identify IF I get delusions. Which means I'm probably just unaware honestly, I was unaware of my hallucinations being hallucinations for 20 goddamn years. I wanna sleep. I'm so fucking tired. And I'm so fucking angry right now. I've calmed down from the initial adrenaline rush but I can tell I'm still absolutely fucking wired. I'm really good at waiting it out but can it stop faster? Or maybe it's the only reason I can think right now. 

I should play a game. Or listen to music. But they're Wrong right now. I swear to god dealing with my brain's own hypocrisy is going to give me a fucking ulcer or something if I don't already have one. And I don't mean I'm lacking energy or enjoyment, I don't think I am right now. I'm just so fucking pissed off. I can't imagine music or a game right now, I'm just so fucking pissed off. And it feels kinda good. I've tried keeping myself quiet and ""calm"" and a fucking doormat for so goddamn fukcing long, it feels good. I'm also very fucking triggered, this is a symptom, and it's not a good one! But once this wears off, I probably won't be able to think or concentrate. I can already kinda feel it. It's terrifying, it's like I'm not even alive. It's coming on fast though, as I type this. I gusss I'm calming down whether I want to or not.

Calm is the reason I started writing this though. I'd still rather be calm and barely alive/thinking than pissed off like that. I sent my partner a lot of angry things, not angry at HIM, but angry at our roommates, and he's a sensitive guy. He has notifications on so he'll be able to read like 60% of them and it'd be cruel to leave him with 60% of a rant and no conclusion so I can't delete it, it'd fuck with him worse than reading my rant so uh oopsie... again... I hate getting so angry when I feel unsafe. Makes me feel like a ""violent schizophrenic"" stereotype. And my worst symptom by far is fucking paranoia.

At this point, I&amp;#39;m not even sure if me thinking our roommates wanna kill me is a fucking delusion or if they are. Disclaimer, it&amp;#39;s uh probably a delusion. Idk, I&amp;#39;m also trans and they&amp;#39;re kinda really against that, so it&amp;#39;s hard to tell lmao I wonder why my paranoia keeps getting worse!!! I wonder!!! I fucking wonder!!! I don&amp;#39;t want to talk about &amp;quot;why I don&amp;#39;t leave&amp;quot; btw, I&amp;#39;m ignoring everyone that asks that even if you have other stuff in your comment. Don&amp;#39;t ask that. Thinking about it will literally trigger me when I&amp;#39;ve finally started calming down, don&amp;#39;t ask why I haven&amp;#39;t left. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to sleep. I have literal trauma surrounding sleep aids but I&amp;#39;m desperate enough to try them again after 15 years. I&amp;#39;m already paranoid as hell (my worst positive symptom), I don&amp;#39;t wanna think about my hallucinations really starting up again. The visual ones are manageable. The tactile ones, I&amp;#39;m literally terrified of getting those back bad again. It&amp;#39;s always bugs. The visual ones are usually bugs now that I think about it actually. And I actually have yet to identify IF I get delusions. Which means I&amp;#39;m probably just unaware honestly, I was unaware of my hallucinations being hallucinations for 20 goddamn years. I wanna sleep. I&amp;#39;m so fucking tired. And I&amp;#39;m so fucking angry right now. I&amp;#39;ve calmed down from the initial adrenaline rush but I can tell I&amp;#39;m still absolutely fucking wired. I&amp;#39;m really good at waiting it out but can it stop faster? Or maybe it&amp;#39;s the only reason I can think right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should play a game. Or listen to music. But they&amp;#39;re Wrong right now. I swear to god dealing with my brain&amp;#39;s own hypocrisy is going to give me a fucking ulcer or something if I don&amp;#39;t already have one. And I don&amp;#39;t mean I&amp;#39;m lacking energy or enjoyment, I don&amp;#39;t think I am right now. I&amp;#39;m just so fucking pissed off. I can&amp;#39;t imagine music or a game right now, I&amp;#39;m just so fucking pissed off. And it feels kinda good. I&amp;#39;ve tried keeping myself quiet and &amp;quot;calm&amp;quot; and a fucking doormat for so goddamn fukcing long, it feels good. I&amp;#39;m also very fucking triggered, this is a symptom, and it&amp;#39;s not a good one! But once this wears off, I probably won&amp;#39;t be able to think or concentrate. I can already kinda feel it. It&amp;#39;s terrifying, it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m not even alive. It&amp;#39;s coming on fast though, as I type this. I gusss I&amp;#39;m calming down whether I want to or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calm is the reason I started writing this though. I&amp;#39;d still rather be calm and barely alive/thinking than pissed off like that. I sent my partner a lot of angry things, not angry at HIM, but angry at our roommates, and he&amp;#39;s a sensitive guy. He has notifications on so he&amp;#39;ll be able to read like 60% of them and it&amp;#39;d be cruel to leave him with 60% of a rant and no conclusion so I can&amp;#39;t delete it, it&amp;#39;d fuck with him worse than reading my rant so uh oopsie... again... I hate getting so angry when I feel unsafe. Makes me feel like a &amp;quot;violent schizophrenic&amp;quot; stereotype. And my worst symptom by far is fucking paranoia. When your entire life has been pain, is believing you were born to suffer a delusion? Fuck&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"On my medical charts it says I have schizophrenia but it feels weird having that label when I’m not even sure I actually have it.

Below are the details of the psychosis but it’s long so feel free to skip that part/section, but I put it in case it could be useful. I’m not looking for medical advice so hopefully this doesn’t get removed but just want to hear perspectives and opinions from people who actually have schizophrenia. 

Back in 2021 I was under an insane amount of stress and psychosis came on out of nowhere one day during work. I had no idea what day of the week it was (someone told me it was a Friday, and I would never forget if it was Friday ever) and I just felt vaguely confused all day. Got in my car and read an article about Huntingtons disease (a progressive disease sort of like parkinsons or dementia) and was convinced that I had it and that my entire family knew but never told me. I was convinced my best friend was hired by my family because they knew I was going to die and needed a good friend. I called a bunch of family members accusing them of this and then they took me to a crisis center where my delusion rapidly changed to thinking I was being punished for something I did in a past life or that this was all a police set up my family helped with and that I was going to jail. I eventually started to think I was dead and in hell (like that my entire life has actually been disguised as real but was really hell and that I did something terrible when I was alive on earth but no memory of that life). I started to think they were going to deprive me of water as torture so I grabbed hand sanitizer and drank it then I walked out of the building on to the side of the street and the police quickly came and had me involuntarily committed. They had me wait in an ER room before being transferred to get things in order with the door open and a “sitter” outside. People were walking by the door mocking me or repeating things I’ve said to people before in the past. And when the TV was turned on all the commercials looked like they were from the 90s (even a chipotle commercial which wasn’t around then) and the people on the news were speaking gibberish. I now realize that those were hallucinations. I thought those were the only time but days later my doctor wrote in my notes (which I saw when I got out on my online portal) that I denied having hallucinations but she noted that I was “clearly preoccupied with something external” and my eyes would rapidly dart around the room. She also said I would start saying a sentence but get lost and not finish them. There was an event where I asked if I could touch a nurse’s eyelashes and tried to grab her rounds binder out of her hands. I literally have no memory of this but it’s in my notes. Things started to feel more “normal” each day and I was released after 2 weeks once my family was on board. When I left I questioned if things were just back to “fake normal” again and if I was still in hell or a simulation because everything that happened felt so real and fucked up. 

Back to today. I’ve been mostly okay since then- no hallucinations, no hearing things, no actual full on psychosis. My problem is I think I still have paranoia but not sure if that is the accurate term. Like for example, I often wonder if my professor just pretends very well to like me but actually hates me and is constantly analyzing my every move and testing to see how I would respond to certain questions. Or I will wonder if my aunts texts have some underlying meaning or that she is being passive aggressive. Things like that. But could that just be overthinking/anxiety related considering it’s just me contemplating if it’s true rather than downright believing it is?

I belong to a schizoaffective support group on Facebook and people always post about having hallucinations daily for years and that it’s just an every day thing for them. I can’t relate to any of them since mine only occurred during psychosis which was only once years ago. It makes me wonder if I even have it.",t2_jduqxzcpt,False,,0,False,Diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia but I’ve only had one episode of psychosis almost 3 years ago,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18y73bs,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Opinion / Thought / Idea / Discussion ,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1704352321.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my medical charts it says I have schizophrenia but it feels weird having that label when I’m not even sure I actually have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the details of the psychosis but it’s long so feel free to skip that part/section, but I put it in case it could be useful. I’m not looking for medical advice so hopefully this doesn’t get removed but just want to hear perspectives and opinions from people who actually have schizophrenia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2021 I was under an insane amount of stress and psychosis came on out of nowhere one day during work. I had no idea what day of the week it was (someone told me it was a Friday, and I would never forget if it was Friday ever) and I just felt vaguely confused all day. Got in my car and read an article about Huntingtons disease (a progressive disease sort of like parkinsons or dementia) and was convinced that I had it and that my entire family knew but never told me. I was convinced my best friend was hired by my family because they knew I was going to die and needed a good friend. I called a bunch of family members accusing them of this and then they took me to a crisis center where my delusion rapidly changed to thinking I was being punished for something I did in a past life or that this was all a police set up my family helped with and that I was going to jail. I eventually started to think I was dead and in hell (like that my entire life has actually been disguised as real but was really hell and that I did something terrible when I was alive on earth but no memory of that life). I started to think they were going to deprive me of water as torture so I grabbed hand sanitizer and drank it then I walked out of the building on to the side of the street and the police quickly came and had me involuntarily committed. They had me wait in an ER room before being transferred to get things in order with the door open and a “sitter” outside. People were walking by the door mocking me or repeating things I’ve said to people before in the past. And when the TV was turned on all the commercials looked like they were from the 90s (even a chipotle commercial which wasn’t around then) and the people on the news were speaking gibberish.

,schizophrenia,"I haven't showered or brushed my teeth in at least three weeks. Possibly more than a month. I'm not sure.

I've had problems in the past with being unable to get in the shower or unable to leave the shower due to hallucinations / anxiety.

This is a stupid, embarrassing question, but do any of you have suggestions on how to get myself back on track with my personal hygiene? I don't understand what the problem is and I'm not sure how to solve it. I think part of it has to do with a pervasive sense of being unsafe in my apartment, and part of it may have to do with a shoulder injury I need to see my doctor about. 

I did change my clothes today, so that's a win.

My therapist and psychiatrist are both aware of the issue, but offered no solutions. They both basically said ""well call the crisis line if you need to, bye"". I don't think this is a crisis that requires strangers to come to my house and try to talk me through it, and I don't really think that would help at all.

I've already read through several related posts, some of which were helpful, but I'm looking for actionable solutions that don't require me to first go to the store. Although I might wind up doing that anyways if I can't convince myself to shower before like 2pm.

Right now I'm telling myself that if I shower and trim my nails, I'll get to paint them, which would be smth nice to do for myself. And after reading through related posts I'm considering cutting my hair again, although it's already fairly short, to minimize the amount of care it needs. I'm also considering taking some as-needed antianxiety meds and allowing myself to nap afterwards if necessary, but I hate the thought of a simple shower taking all day.

A family member has an important appointment on the 8th and I don't want to be stuck in a car with them if I haven't showered in the past \~two months or so.

,schizophrenia,"I'm not asking for a diagnosis or psychiatric advice, just a suggestions to help me understand better.

Since I was younger I've had what feels to me as consistent psychosis with short breaks in between (I can't remember the exact age but I remember having them more than not). The ones I remember were believing people could hear my thoughts, dreams potentially accessed in the future so I couldn't dream, sound and video recording of me in my room, believing everyone around me was fake (this was a repeated one where I believed I was either in some form of hell/simulation where I was the only conscious being \[this stayed with me a worrying amount of time\]), the most recent and terrifying one was believing the house across the road was recording me. In the final one I even spoke to my mom about seeing someone wear a mask in the window and staring at me for hours, I believed I saw a red little light from someone's window that turned off whenever I looked through my window. This resulted in me keeping my blinds shut for months and living in complete darkness, I even attempted to record them to have evidence, often it kept me up late at night looking through a gap in my blind. This final one was around 3-4 years ago (my memory is incredibly foggy) and I haven't had any others since.

When I looked into the schizophrenia and psychosis a year or two after the final one it felt surreal that I could have these ideas and questioned if I'd even know if they were fake if I really had experienced psychosis. When I began looking into it, this was at a time when I was going through the process of getting an autism diagnosis; I have now been diagnosed with both Autism and ADHD including flags for generalised anxiety and depression. So now, I question whether these experiences were real or conjured from an imagination.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I believe they started before the age of 12 (although as previously mentioned I have very foggy memory), as I have read it appears to be abnormal to begin having such events at that age. Secondly, Autism and Schizophrenia comorbidity is very rare to my knowledge and seems unlikely. Thirdly, from my memory, psychosis occurs due to an excess of dopamine, this is contradictory to ADHD as I would of had significantly lower dopamine. Overall, my age and lack of recent events makes me skeptical of my past experiences, I struggle to tell if they are even real when writing - I know I experienced those things and believed them to be real but was it just childlike behabiour; and, why now have I stopped having any events when on ADHD meds which should hypothetically mean I experience psychosis if I infact had something of the sort.

If I could have any advice, anything at all. It would be super helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hi so I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. I really don't feel very well at the moment. My thoughts became very dark a couple of months ago and I started minorly hallucinating visualy. Upped my meds to max dose and I think I am unwell again. I am hearing voices inside my head that are not my voice they tell me they are demons and they chant 666 ,kill yourself, your nothing, they are all watching you, hahahahahaha etc. They are telling me to hurt people violently and I am scared. I've been having horrible thoughts recently that I'm sure are not my own too. This stuff disturbs me big time. It makes me worry if I am a psychopath but when i am more well i am not violent at all quite the opposite i like to think im very kind.

I have been carrying a small knife for my protection and sleeping with a knife under my pillow. Im having visual flashes of me violently killing people and im dreaming about it too. This is really disturbing me. I feel really paranoid that people are coming to kill me and my partner and my dogs. I can't stop listening to devil music and drawing weird devilish things. I am really worried that something is going to happen and I will kill someone and be put in prison for the rest of my life or a secure unit. I do NOT want to hurt anyone or cause anyone any harm but I have a weird outside force telling me that I need to do it.

I forgot how to pull away on the clutch in my car earlier and this was the last straw. I have decided its time to give up driving for the meantime now.

I feel like I'm losing my mind more and more each day. I keep completely forgetting what I'm saying mid conversation aswell. This happens 5 times minimum a day. I will literally be explaining something to someone or telling a story and ill just completely forget what I was talking about. I do this with things I'm doing too I forget what I'm doing or get distracted. 

I have been baking 5 loaves of different bread a day and I've watched the same programme 150 times now ( i say watched but just listened too). Because I can't concentrate on anything. 

I am not washing properly, maybe once or twice a week and I'm not eating. Maybe once a day with my meds and half a sandwich or something when I do.

then he started at workplace B where he had a hotel room paid for by the company and he thought there were cameras in the room and that everyone thought he was on drugs because he is prescribed adderall. he thought people from workplace B were also connected to workplace A and that management from workplace A used to work at workplace B. he quit there because he hated it. 

now he thinks people from workplace A and B and at his new job C are talking about him and talked to his doctor (who is my mom’s boss) to change his medication and that people from there also called me and i talked to them. he got a new job at workplace C driving food deliveries and he seemed happy for a few weeks. he overshared at his interview which he has done everywhere he worked. but now he thinks people from workplace C are also out to get him and know what happened at workplace A/ were there on the phone call. 

there’s a lot more i can’t remember but the point is yesterday he called his sister explaining all this because he thought a specific woman he is having problems with knows his sister. his sister obviously thought something was wrong and didn’t believe him and was talking to him about mental acuity and told him to see his doctor as an emergency appointment. he talked on the phone to his doctor and got a referral to a neurologist. except he only talked to his doctor about possibly having autism because he has been saying he has autism and at one point thought he was diagnosed but i told him a family doctor cannot diagnose him with autism. ive been telling him to be completely honest and talk about everything from his first workplace to now. hopefully even if he wasnt going there for symptoms of psychosis, with this whole story; a neurologist wouldnt miss it. 

a month ago i wrote this whole letter trying to talk to him about his paranoia because he thought i was on the phone call 2 years ago and that my mom was also on the phone call. because supposedly when he came home that day we were sitting on the couch and he felt like we were staring. i told him i talk to my mom sometimes and it has nothing to do with him and that me and my mom sharing the couch isnt that weird. 

now when he was eating breakfast he said i was having secret phone calls months ago talking about him. he thinks people are trying to learn really private inappropriate things about him. i told him i didnt talk to anyone about him and that im really worried he might be going through psychosis and he got up and left and went on a walk. i just want to know if anyone has had similar experiences on either end and what i can do to be there for him while not reinforcing his delusions? he doesnt seem to understand why i get upset when he is making accusations about me or people i know.

,schizophrenia,"I am a feminine bodied person. I have mentioned all this to a therapist. This is an organized way for me to potentially present what I go through to the feminine body gaurdian I lived with.

I lived in a family where the feminine bodied guardian did all the work, and the masculine body guardian stayed at home (non-working, unsure of status now).

when I was younger, I would experience non-consensual visuals, where my masculine body guardian was having sex with me. Even in the visuals it was very clear that I was uncomfortable with what was going on and the masculine body parent would be aware that I was uncomfortable in the visuals and still continue.

some of the visuals I would experience when I was younger, was me being in a ring with young, feminine bodied, people, and men and dark burgundy, maroon brown coats would be having sex with the children, and I was one of those children. this was before I knew about sex, orgies, or sex rings. I started to have visuals of me in a room with different bed and the masculine bodied gaurdian I grew up with was raping me.

when I went to college, I started noticing that right when I was about to orgasm, the visual would come up of the masculine bodied gaurdian, and he would take all of the energy that was released from my orgasm. I did send a text to the masculine body guardian, telling him to stop taking my sexual energy.

Today I had a dream that the masculine body gaurdian transformed into another masculine bodied form, and had sex with me, and then avoided me at all costs. It was only after I woke up that I realize that the boy that I had been chasing in my dream and then ignored me, was my masculine bodied gaurdian.

even after I woke up, I did a bit of moving the energy by taking my hands and physically removing the places where I can feel the masculine body gaurdians energy. Yesterday I could smell the masculine body guardian when I was awake and I thought about how non-consensual it felt to be able to smell my masculine body guardian because I do not want to interact with my masculine bodied guardian on air through waves.

Anyone experience anything similar with gaurdians or sibilings?

I'm posting this in the hope of starting a dialogue with anyone who may have experienced something within the dynamics of their family. How did you handle it? Did you discover any strategies or support systems that aided you in navigating through these profoundly personal encounters?

Your narratives, perspectives and any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Lets establish a nurturing environment, for those who have faced obstacles.

I’m not sure if it can be connoted to psychotic disorders (then again I’m not neccessarily emotionally invested in the labels, i would like to hear experiences instead because i feel alone and I’m a frequent poster here, on other subs i wasn’t even allowed to post this)

It really sucks, bc it’s like i feel everything as if i was experiencing it 5 fold, but at the same time, i dont understand it and my empathy is limited to feeling, i cannot care, only feel like i re-live trauma but I’m not really interested, mostly bc of how much distress it makes me feel

its like you tell me someone died, i would probably feel anxious if you talk about it long enough but i will still not really care. i had some major empathy errors in my life, often when something bad happened to other people or someone got in front of my own needs, i always think about myself, i dont really know what is it like to care without having intense physical pain from it. I either would give my life for someone or not care at all and not much in between, even that turns on and off so suddenly i stop or start caring

the day before yesterday my best friend was in tears from physical pain and i didnt understand her cue that was politely telling me that she can’t talk right now, i couldnt understand why would she be so upset, i simoly didnt have the ability, same with everything else, but if it’s not my best friend then most of the personal distress is gone, i simply dont feel moved unless I’m manipulated into it by the WAY the story is told, last time my friend had an autistic meltdown bc of not getting ice cream (we are 19 and 21(me)) and it felt worse than when i hear news of someones passing, i felt absolutely in despair what to do and as i saw her getting more and more involved i kind of broke to pieces as well, it felt like someone was shouting at me

i wake up and my first thought “you dont deserve to live you emotionless worthless monstér / error”

if someone told me in a chill way “yeah i broke my legs and lost an arm”

i would think “alright, anyways that sucks but it’s not my problem, I refuse to talk about topics that bother me”

but i dont want to hurt anyone so i will just say “yeah im sorry, it must suck, you feeling better?”

otherwise they come at me furiously and i start feeling extreme shame (i self harmed bc of that)

i wish i didnt feel THIS amount of guilt

anyone else?

In 2019 I took Abilify that gave me really bad unintentional movements, my arm leg etc would randomly kick or punch. Would happen 100s of times a day. Got better over a year but still sometimes to this day my head jerks back and blink really hard, or my eyelids close and then flutter for a second. But I think what caused it is that the same kind of thing had been going on with me since I was a kid, when id close my eyes I sometimes start to blink rapidly, its like that now just way way worse.

I saw a neurologist who said medication doesn't work for the type I have, said I have eyelid myoclonia. He asked me about my driver's license 3 times during the appointment and said he didn't want me to get an EEG cause I'd instantly lose it if failed.

I haven't seen any psych or neuro for a long time since then. The hearing things is way better. I think I was paying attention to them too much, it always seems to happen if I listen for it. Most of the time it isn't even voices, usually it's music or sound effects.

I've had a lot of family deaths recently, lostmyjob etc. went and saw a psychiatrist last month. She thinks I probably have epilepsy though and doesn't want to give me anything that might make it worse. She said she's gonna try n talk to the neuro I saw but I really don't want to look too much into it because they have very strict laws about driving with epilepsy where I live.

,schizophrenia,"My partner told me yesterday when I was beating myself up that I need to accept the reality that I'm disabled. 

I was basically telling her that I was supposed to be something great, I was an A+ student before all of this hit and was in my second year of college (had to drop out), I wanted to be in the medical field... now I just feel stupid and useless and so DUMB, like my brain just feels so intolerably dumb. I still have the want to be in the medical field, but my partner says it's an unrealistic standard and that I need to change my goal to something more achievable. I did have one other dream, to write fiction novels, but I don't know if I could ever follow through on that or if I would be successful. 

I can't work because it's too stressful, I can barely go to the grocery store or a doctor's appointment without being overwhelmed the rest of the day. I can barely do hobbies like play video games or draw because I get frustrated. I also have depression and severe anxiety. (Technically I am Schizoaffective Bipolar Type but I haven't had any hypomania in a long time so I think I'm depressive type). I can't even keep my house clean, and if it gets too dirty I can't clean it because I get too overwhelmed by all the stuff. You can probably see how this wouldn't go too well in a work environment. I had 2 jobs in the past, but didn't work long enough to get SSDI so I'm waiting on SSI (specifically for someone in the department to get put on my case, I got past the initial stuff but I've been waiting 6 months so far).

Anyways, I'm getting off topic. How do I accept that I can likely never achieve the high standards I have set for myself? That I was supposed to do great things in life and be successful, and I'm not what I imagined I would be? How do I stop beating myself up for being a ""loser"" with no job and no life?

My positive symptoms are in check with meds, but the anxiety is severe and hasn't been helped by anything and the depression sucks, plus I still have some negative symptoms (which there is no meds for). So I'm ""stable,"" but not stable enough to ever do what I want to in life. I'm in therapy.

&lt;p&gt;I was basically telling her that I was supposed to be something great, I was an A+ student before all of this hit and was in my second year of college (had to drop out), I wanted to be in the medical field... now I just feel stupid and useless and so DUMB, like my brain just feels so intolerably dumb. I still have the want to be in the medical field, but my partner says it&amp;#39;s an unrealistic standard and that I need to change my goal to something more achievable. I did have one other dream, to write fiction novels, but I don&amp;#39;t know if I could ever follow through on that or if I would be successful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t work because it&amp;#39;s too stressful, I can barely go to the grocery store or a doctor&amp;#39;s appointment without being overwhelmed the rest of the day. I can barely do hobbies like play video games or draw because I get frustrated. I also have depression and severe anxiety.

,schizophrenia,"*Just after that dream I had, I felt like standing up fast and writing it down.*  
I woke up with ""two guys"" speaking to me: **""Hell or Solitude""**.  
It fits my current situation. It's full of solitude,   
but I haven't yet 'remembered' what hell is like.  
This nightmare showed me what hell is like.   
It was a torture dream that kept repeating, but with everchanging situations.  
They kind of killed me, then I 'woke up' in another similar dream, and they kept killing me again.  
Usually I am not dreaming such heavy stuff because I am always protected somehow.  
But this time ""they invaded"" my mind very heavily in my sleep and I could hear their voices again  
(only) while waking up.   


When I am awake, I am mostly free of bad thoughts because of my medication.  
But I had it now several times that in my light sleep the ""inner people"" come back.   
In my case these are some military guys with access to my brain.  
I could swear they are invading my mind now in my sleep, not when I am awake anymore,  
but when I can't remember what they are doing when I am asleep.   
I am having this theory since my first voices and despite my medication.   
After this dream, I could swear that these people are real in my head,   
and they have the technology to play tricks on me when I am asleep.  
**So, to adress my inner demons:**  


**I won't give in. You can f\*ck with my head as much as you want.**  
**I stay honest to myself and I will talk about your potential existence.**  
**Because if you're real, the world is f\*cked and just gets worser if the technology is available en masse. You picked the wrong one and you know it.**

&lt;strong&gt;I stay honest to myself and I will talk about your potential existence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Because if you&amp;#39;re real, the world is f*cked and just gets worser if the technology is available en masse. You picked the wrong one and you know it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Keep on hiding and playing with peoples heads until they find out.&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
