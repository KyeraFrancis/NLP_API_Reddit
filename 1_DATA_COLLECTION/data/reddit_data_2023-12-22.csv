,Army,"Informational Post for you transitioning folks

For anyone unaware there exists a field in the civilian world called Biomedical Equipment Technician or BMET (there's also a MOS for it that offers some of the best training in the industry so reclassing for it to go reserves or guard is an option as well). You work in a hospital setting repairing and PMCSing medical equipment, everything from hospital bed to MRI machines. You do NOT need a degree to work in this field but having one does make you more marketable. That being said if you are looking to get into a technical field with little to no experience this is a good option.

Firstly there is the college portion. If you choose, you can use your skillbridge to pursue a 2 year degree or certificate as a BMET though the College of Biomedical Equipment Technology. It is completely remote and is done online. Furthermore they will work with hospitals in your area, (or area you plan to relocate to upon ETS) to find you OJT as well, but is not required to complete the course. The President of the college is an Army veteran himself and the school is very much set up to accommodate military service members. That being said, even if you don't purse it as a skillbridge the scheduling works where you could potentially (given you role/MOS) attend the college during your transition window without it being on skillbridge.[https://cbet.edu/programs/](https://cbet.edu/programs/)

Secondly, the company I will be working for, Trimedx, is an independent service provider and has contracts with hospitals all over the US. They also offer a skillbridge internship.

If you have any questions about the field, the college, Trimedx, or even other companies, please feel free to reach out and DM me any questions you might have.

,Army,"I need help and advice about a serious situation my brother is in. I will try to provide the least information because I am afraid for his safety. He enlisted a few years ago and now lives overseas. He married another soldier not a year ago. None of his relatives know much about this person nor have met them in person.

He's being a victim of narcissistic abuse and it has become physical against him. His life has already been in danger. I convinced him to talk to his superiors which he did, but I have strong suspicion this may have backfired in the way that his abuser may have convinced him to get back together and take the fall for any reports he made. I believe even his career may be in danger. 

He's normally very communicative which drastically changed after the last violent event against him by his partner. I also have strong reasons to believe his phone is being monitored by his partner. I know for a fact that there has been times in which his social media posts and even text message replies have been done by his partner and not him. I am certain that since the last violent event against him occurred, his communication with his family is being monitored.

He's a sweet, kind person and unfortunately, this might make him the perfect person to be the victim of this. I not only fear for him facing consequences that do not belong to him, but also for his life and safety.   


What should I do? Should I call someone (his superiors or FAP)  to tell them what I know? Would that do any good? How can I make sure he's safe and that he has a support system that would understand narcissistic abuse and work with men who go through it? I will appreciate any advice and knowledge.

,Army,"We met at the beginning of June, and have been talking every day since. He's in the US, and I'm in the UK. He's also a sergeant in the military, so he's busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven't phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I'm too anxious to, but he's said that he'd find the time and we could whenever I'm ready. But we've sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven't made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.

But I don't know whether that's going to be possible now.

Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn't feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he's 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn't respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he'd been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn't be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn't have a right to know as we weren't officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.

Everything was fine for a while.

But then he didn't respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he'd had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He's had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I'm aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven't heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He's just completely disappeared on me, and I'm absolutely terrified.

I don't have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I'd never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn't big on social media), so there's no way I can ""stalk"" him to somehow find their details either. I've tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there's nothing.

He's a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn't lie about any of this. I really don't want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.

,Army,"So like the title says I'm only losing weight at extreme levels. I came into osut overweight at 238lbs but I worked Construction as an underground pipefitter so I was in good shape muscle wise just ate like garbage and smoked a pack and a pack of zyn a day so cardio was just shit. I turned green right before hbl and now weigh 185. My cardio has improved tremendously started with a 23ish min 2 mile pushing myself and did an acft before leave and got a 14:32 2 mile (dont mean to toot my horn but honestly couldve gone faster even) and went from D group to the front of B group in the company runs but fuck I used to be able to do 50 push ups and was totally spent after just 24 pushups and went from pushing myself and doing a 300 deadlift to barely doing only 220.. My drills definitely ripped me a new one for it. I feel weaker and weaker everyday. In the next phases will this change?  Do they start giving us more time to eat or possibly more protein? It's honestly frustrating as hell.

I came into osut overweight at 238lbs but I worked Construction as an underground pipefitter so I was in good shape muscle wise just ate like garbage and smoked a pack and a pack of zyn a day so cardio was just shit. I turned green right before hbl and now weigh 185. My cardio has improved tremendously started with a 23ish min 2 mile pushing myself and did an acft before leave and got a 14:32 2 mile (dont mean to toot my horn but honestly couldve gone faster even) and went from D group to the front of B group in the company runs but fuck I used to be able to do 50 push ups and was totally spent after just 24 pushups and went from pushing myself and doing a 300 deadlift to barely doing only 220.. My drills definitely ripped me a new one for it. I feel weaker and weaker everyday. In the next phases will this change?  Do they start giving us more time to eat or possibly more protein? It&amp;#39;s honestly frustrating as hell. I eat every bit of protein I can in the dfac but I can&amp;#39;t just shovel food in my face like others can and if I eat too fast I just throw up after when we inevitably hear half right face or get thrown in the pit.

I'm a POG in Afghanistan. I've been in my first unit for only 3 months and I'm deployed. There's a specialist in my section that misses PT 50% of the time.

I was active duty, ETS'd to the IRR for a short period, and joined a USAR unit in late 2021. My contract time on the DA3540 was for ""3 years.""

,Army," I think everyone knows a boot. The guy who wears combat boots, grunt style hoodie, and has a high and tight at the airport with his assault pack. You can spot them from a mile away. Well, at a mandatory fun event for our unit, there were some guys in uniform, even though the uniform was civvies. They weren't doing some detail, they just showed up in uniform. That got me thinking. Has anyone ever met or known a solider who was ALWAYS in uniform? Even off duty? Like im talking going out on a Saturday and theyre wearing OCPs, or on a date, they bust out the ASUs. At the gym? PTs, even on weekends and on their own time or even off post. Obviously being deployed doesnt count since thats really all you can wear, I'm talking everyday normal garrison life. I feel like nobody has ever done this, but I'd love to hear if anyone has ever encountered a ""super boot"".

The guy who wears combat boots, grunt style hoodie, and has a high and tight at the airport with his assault pack. You can spot them from a mile away. Well, at a mandatory fun event for our unit, there were some guys in uniform, even though the uniform was civvies. They weren&amp;#39;t doing some detail, they just showed up in uniform. That got me thinking. Has anyone ever met or known a solider who was ALWAYS in uniform? Even off duty? Like im talking going out on a Saturday and theyre wearing OCPs, or on a date, they bust out the ASUs. At the gym? PTs, even on weekends and on their own time or even off post. Obviously being deployed doesnt count since thats really all you can wear, I&amp;#39;m talking everyday normal garrison life. I feel like nobody has ever done this, but I&amp;#39;d love to hear if anyone has ever encountered a &amp;quot;super boot&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

Please don't come at me for this. Two people with differing opinions and neither of us are in the service. 

Someone served in the marine reserves for around 5 years, give or take. He never went to combat or anything like that, and has no psychological issues from his time in the service. He does from his childhood.

 He was married to a woman and was arrested for hitting her, and somehow honorably discharged. Now several years later he's in jail again for brutally beating his gf woman while under the influence. 

In your opinion, are these the kind of situations that veteran housing is intended for? When he gets out, he will be getting a funded new 1br home to live in.

Its Pogue, as in &amp;quot;pogey bait.&amp;quot;   Pogey is WWII slang for a homosexual.   Most of you have probably read the book &lt;em&gt;Battle Cry&lt;/em&gt;.   The unit described therein is the &amp;quot;Pogey bait 6th&amp;quot; of Belleau Wood fame.    Pogey bait is candy, the candy being the bait, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, I&amp;#39;m fighting a losing battle.  Even the Washington Post&amp;#39;s Military reporters use the term POG.  But still, I&amp;#39;m willing to absolutely die on this hill.   &lt;/p&gt;

It's your Hots&amp;Cots guy. If you're new here and don't know what H&amp;C is, it is a yelp like app for barracks, dfacs, &amp; other parts of the installation for all branches to make positive and negative experiences more public. It was born out of the GAO report back in September. If you're not familiar with it you can get some highlights [here](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1736808351089176803.html)

Yeah, but what about congress? I'm getting there or scroll down (I'm not your boss)

Some highlights since release:

* Over 2,000 downloads and 70 reports. 
* We've established a working relationship with JBLM to get issues addressed sooner rather than later. Most recently an issue with mold and SUDDC (kind of resolved).
* CSM over at Eustis chatted about an issue over there.

**H&amp;C &amp; Congress**

No I'm not running, but some time ago I reached out Jeff Jackson who is a freshman congressman for the state of North Carolina and today I had the pleasure of meeting with his military advisor to chat about Hots&amp;Cots.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s your Hots&amp;amp;Cots guy. If you&amp;#39;re new here and don&amp;#39;t know what H&amp;amp;C is, it is a yelp like app for barracks, dfacs, &amp;amp; other parts of the installation for all branches to make positive and negative experiences more public. It was born out of the GAO report back in September. If you&amp;#39;re not familiar with it you can get some highlights &lt;a href=""https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1736808351089176803.html""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, but what about congress? I&amp;#39;m getting there or scroll down (I&amp;#39;m not your boss)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some highlights since release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 2,000 downloads and 70 reports. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#39;ve established a working relationship with JBLM to get issues addressed sooner rather than later. Most recently an issue with mold and SUDDC (kind of resolved).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSM over at Eustis chatted about an issue over there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No I&amp;#39;m not running, but some time ago I reached out Jeff Jackson who is a freshman congressman for the state of North Carolina and today I had the pleasure of meeting with his military advisor to chat about Hots&amp;amp;Cots.

I find myself laying in bed at night unable to sleep wondering how the hell I got here. I think I struggle having an identity because going to combat was all I ever wanted to do growing up.

Now I‚Äôm 31 and feel like life is so meaningless. I have a wife and a dog, I have a great career, I‚Äôm in great shape and look young for my age. I really have no complaints other than everything in life feels so fake, like a giant charade.

One of the hardest pills for me to swallow is how nobody really cares. I put the USMC and being a combat grunt on such a pedestal growing up. When I was finally in, I felt so much pride.

In this first interview with Derl Horn, we go over his early childhood, what led him to the Marines, boot camp at Marine Corp Recruiting Depot San Diego, boot camp stories, being the 'grandpa' of his boot camp platoon, and a married Marine moving to ITR, going to Camp Lejeune and Cuba, and then receiving orders to depart for Vietnam. He would be assigned to the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines (1/9) one of the Marine Corps' most legendary battalions with a history from Bougainville, Guam, and Iwo Jima to numerous operations in South Vietnam along the DMZ. In his time with 1/9, he would partake in numerous combat operations, including Operation Buffalo, where Bravo Company would have 57 Marines killed in one day on 2 July 1967.
