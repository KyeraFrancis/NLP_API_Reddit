,Army,"Dear SMA,

How to fix the army in a few easy steps:

1) get your head out of your butt

2) hire me. I'm currently working on my Master's to be a therapist, so I know how to listen. 

3) pay me $50k and send me around the country (and OCONUS) for a year. I'll go base to base in birkenstocks and shorts and take soldiers out for lunch—the normal guys. The terminal E4, the PFC struggling but *trying* to pass their H/W, the SSG whose brother died and yet the SSG can't go home for the funeral because leadership said so. Give me a budget of $40 x working day to buy these dudes lunch and hear what's going on in their life

4) I'll take detailed notes, and at the end of the year we will synthesize all the information and create a weekend/weeklong course for senior leadership. 

5) we take a number of groups of senior leadership through this course about how to deal with soldier issues in ""the new army"", starting with not denying emergency leave just because we need the soldier ""just in case""

6) make it very clear that this is an order and failure to treat soldiers like humans will result in adverse action

,Army,"So I need some advice because no one in my unit really wants to help me with medical issues that I'm having. I've been diagnosed with chronic anxiety which just showed up out of nowhere before annual training last year and I knew there was nothing to be worried about but it still happened. I've turned in medical records for all of that. I also developed gastroesophical reflux disease (GERD) along with chronic IBS and chronic gastritis which causes me severe stomach pain especially when I'm stressed. My COC knows about all of this and it has been sent in writing along with documentation from doctors that is signed. I have a pending medical profile but I still have people (especially my PSG) saying that since I'm not technically on profile yet that nothing will happen to help me with this since they cannot cover their own a**es. The commander had previously agreed in November to let me RST because the chaos during a weekend at my unit stresses me TF out to the point that I'm in extreme physical pain and cannot sleep at night before and during. I know this seems quite extreme over a drill weekend and I don't understand myself why I'm having these issues but it is what it is I guess. Anyways, I get word 3 days ago that I had to be at drill this weekend from my PSG and it was per the 1SG so I had conflicting information (in my eyes) from the commander and 1SG. I reached out to the full-time staff because I had to go to my unit and get a new CAC as mine was about to expire so I didn't think anything of it and I went to S1 who is actually super helpful and asked about this. I was told to call back that afternoon after she had her meeting with the commander and I did when our S3 sergeant answered the phone and was an absolute smart a** and was like we will see you Saturday. Anyways, I then proceeded to get extremely stressed and got sick so I went to the doctor and got a medical excuse. I sent that in only to get crawled about ignoring COC and that I must fulfill my duties to the army reserves. I was told that I would be excused from drill but would not be able to make it up when I know of another person in my platoon that was allowed to RST this weekend. I'm kind of at a standstill right now because all of my medical conditions which are chronic are being ignored and I don't know how to get this situation handled. I can't go up the COC because my unit will not allow anyone to know how to get in contact with anyone above them in order to get things corrected. There was another soldier who had an injury during an FTX and filed two congressional complaints after the unit did not compensate him for his injury or get him medical care and still nothing was done to help him or compensate him in any way.

I&amp;#39;ve been diagnosed with chronic anxiety which just showed up out of nowhere before annual training last year and I knew there was nothing to be worried about but it still happened. I&amp;#39;ve turned in medical records for all of that. I also developed gastroesophical reflux disease (GERD) along with chronic IBS and chronic gastritis which causes me severe stomach pain especially when I&amp;#39;m stressed. My COC knows about all of this and it has been sent in writing along with documentation from doctors that is signed. I have a pending medical profile but I still have people (especially my PSG) saying that since I&amp;#39;m not technically on profile yet that nothing will happen to help me with this since they cannot cover their own a&lt;strong&gt;es. The commander had previously agreed in November to let me RST because the chaos during a weekend at my unit stresses me TF out to the point that I&amp;#39;m in extreme physical pain and cannot sleep at night before and during. I know this seems quite extreme over a drill weekend and I don&amp;#39;t understand myself why I&amp;#39;m having these issues but it is what it is I guess. Anyways, I get word 3 days ago that I had to be at drill this weekend from my PSG and it was per the 1SG so I had conflicting information (in my eyes) from the commander and 1SG. I reached out to the full-time staff because I had to go to my unit and get a new CAC as mine was about to expire so I didn&amp;#39;t think anything of it and I went to S1 who is actually super helpful and asked about this. I was told to call back that afternoon after she had her meeting with the commander and I did when our S3 sergeant answered the phone and was an absolute smart a&lt;/strong&gt; and was like we will see you Saturday. Anyways, I then proceeded to get extremely stressed and got sick so I went to the doctor and got a medical excuse. I sent that in only to get crawled about ignoring COC and that I must fulfill my duties to the army reserves. I was told that I would be excused from drill but would not be able to make it up when I know of another person in my platoon that was allowed to RST this weekend.

I process these types of actions and for the first offense SM is to be flagged a U and is counseled- 2nd offense it states SM loses security clearance and begins adverse separation.

,Army,"Young NCO looking for mentorship.

Basically, the title...

Insurance costs is the biggest factor in my decision with joining the reserves.

Currently active duty and I'm trying to figure out whether to ETS or go reserves based on health insurance costs for my family (3 Kids, 1 Spouse, 1 income HH). 

I have 2 options ETS with disability (unfortunately broken) or go reserve to keep the health benefits. Yes, I know it has a deductible, out of pocket max, co pay. etc. But compared to the civilian world, companies offering health insurance (example) with 5k deductible and 20k out of pocket max all while still having a high co pay is loads cheaper. Realistically, that would kill our savings in a couple years. My family is blessed to be all healthy (rarely visit doctor) but as we all know anything can happen.

Not worried about myself too much as I expect to use my VA health benefits if ETS. So, to Reserves or to ETS? WWYD? Also, in case you're wondering I shaved before typing this. (PM for pic)

I may be looking at this the wrong way with my young mind (24 yrs old) but I'm really trying to screw my head on straight and make the best decision for my family.

Anyway. A few weeks back, they did a health and welfare (read: raid) on one of the tents and found no shit 12 bottles of booze in one tent. Company wide h&amp;w went into effect. I thought it was dumb but had nothing to hide so whatever. 

Since then on the weekends we noticed the MWR has been locked. Thought it was just the contractors or soldiers in charge of the MWR being opened getting lazy. Well I talk to one of the soldiers in the S Shops about it today, saying how irritating it is. He tells me there’s a reason. 

They simultaneously conducted a raid on the MWR and found 13 bottles of liquor stashed about it. So as such they have closed it indefinitely. This is also in conjunction with “incidents” that have arisen in the MWR itself. 

Some people just can’t control themselves. This morning in fact I found an empty bottle of liquor in a portajohn on the ground. Not the first time, as I’ve previously seen them thrown in the actual toilet of the portajohn itself.

,Army,"What is something you believe to be an unspoken ugly truth of the army?

I have my own, but others experiences may contradict what I believe. If you disagree, feel free to explain why.

My truths:
1. If you are single and unmarried, none of your problems matter and they're all your own fault. In the eyes of leadership, it's always something you did wrong. You didn't budget, you didn't reach out for help, you didn't ask anyone, you didn't do the proper paperwork, you didn't go through your COC, etc. Leadership will always find a way to make a single unmarried soldier's problems their fault. It often starts with direct lower level leadership, i.e. direct NCO and up. ""You should have known what you were signing up for.""

2. Soldiers wanting to commit suicide are often overlooked because people expect it to be the highly exaggerated examples in training. In reality, most Soldiers that are suicidal are, in their minds, making it obvious, but most people don't realize that that's what they're doing. Most people perceive a suicidal soldier as ""going through a rough patch."" Or they think that because they're laughing and joking about their problems that they're coping fine. In my opinion, when someone jokes about their problems, that's their way of crying out for help. Even when you confront them, they're going to lie and say they're good. But they're not.

,USMC,"TL;DR - Looking for some honest feedback on whether it makes sense for me to join USMC reserves as an officer at 30, or whether it's the dumbest idea I've ever had.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey all, after talking with some friends and family members (haven't had a chance to meet with my local OSO yet), I wanted to pose this to the group: I'm a 30-year-old young professional looking for a new challenge in life that'll allow me to make an impact, build my character, and serve my country. Back in high school my dream was to join the Marines. My parents eventually talked me out of it, but the Corps always stayed on my radar.

Fast forward to today and I'm pretty happy with my life. I don't make tons of money, but it's certainly enough to live comfortably as a single person. I've got a solid community and am an active member of a great church. But I've always been taught (and always believed) that a man's highest calling is to protect and provide for others. And I guess I thought that by this time in my life, I'd have a wife and kids to do that for. Seeing as I'm still single as a pringle, though, I continue to feel that ""itch"" to dedicate myself to a cause greater than myself.

A few months ago, I had a chance encounter with a friend of a friend who was about to complete his time in the USMC reserves. He had some great things to say about his experience, and it got the wheels turning. On a whim, I filled out one of those contact forms on the Marines' recruiting website and got in touch (over text) with an OSO. After giving him some more info, we determined that I'd be eligible for an age waiver, seeing as I'm above the age limit.

That brings me to you guys. The way I see it, I've got one life, and if I'm sitting on my deathbed 50 years from now, I think it'd be great to look back and say that I took an opportunity when I had no other major life obligations to serve the country that had given me so much. But another side of me wonders if I'm being a little too high-minded about all of this. I realize how easy it is to romanticize something like this from the outside and then to become disillusioned by constant paperwork, bureaucracy and other headaches down the line. So my question for you all is: would you pursue this if you were me? Or would you run as fast as you can in the other direction?

A bit more detail about me: I work at a nonprofit that would most likely be amenable to long absences caused by OCS, TBS, etc. I've got a master's degree and wouldn't be joining for education benefits or other financial incentives (while taking nothing away from those who do). While I'm currently single, I see myself probably getting married and starting a family in the next 3-4 years. I'm in great aerobic shape and decent strength shape, and feel confident that I could hack it with the young guys. Happy to provide additional details if helpful.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey all, after talking with some friends and family members (haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to meet with my local OSO yet), I wanted to pose this to the group: I&amp;#39;m a 30-year-old young professional looking for a new challenge in life that&amp;#39;ll allow me to make an impact, build my character, and serve my country. Back in high school my dream was to join the Marines. My parents eventually talked me out of it, but the Corps always stayed on my radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today and I&amp;#39;m pretty happy with my life. I don&amp;#39;t make tons of money, but it&amp;#39;s certainly enough to live comfortably as a single person. I&amp;#39;ve got a solid community and am an active member of a great church. But I&amp;#39;ve always been taught (and always believed) that a man&amp;#39;s highest calling is to protect and provide for others. And I guess I thought that by this time in my life, I&amp;#39;d have a wife and kids to do that for. Seeing as I&amp;#39;m still single as a pringle, though, I continue to feel that &amp;quot;itch&amp;quot; to dedicate myself to a cause greater than myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I had a chance encounter with a friend of a friend who was about to complete his time in the USMC reserves. He had some great things to say about his experience, and it got the wheels turning. On a whim, I filled out one of those contact forms on the Marines&amp;#39; recruiting website and got in touch (over text) with an OSO. After giving him some more info, we determined that I&amp;#39;d be eligible for an age waiver, seeing as I&amp;#39;m above the age limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings me to you guys. The way I see it, I&amp;#39;ve got one life, and if I&amp;#39;m sitting on my deathbed 50 years from now, I think it&amp;#39;d be great to look back and say that I took an opportunity when I had no other major life obligations to serve the country that had given me so much. But another side of me wonders if I&amp;#39;m being a little too high-minded about all of this. I realize how easy it is to romanticize something like this from the outside and then to become disillusioned by constant paperwork, bureaucracy and other headaches down the line. So my question for you all is: would you pursue this if you were me? Or would you run as fast as you can in the other direction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit more detail about me: I work at a nonprofit that would most likely be amenable to long absences caused by OCS, TBS, etc. I&amp;#39;ve got a master&amp;#39;s degree and wouldn&amp;#39;t be joining for education benefits or other financial incentives (while taking nothing away from those who do).

IF YOU OR ANYONE YOU KNOW APPLIED TO BE PART OF THE 3M EARPLUG LAWSUIT, THE CUTOFF FOR CONFIRMING YOUR PARTICIPATION IS JAN 25th

We need 98% participation or no one gets their settlement. Yes that is very fucky, but that is why we need to get the word out ASAP

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SHARE THIS 🙏

EDIT: For clarity, this pertains only to service members that served between 2003-2015 and regularly used the faulty 3M double sided earplugs resulting in tinnitus and/or hearing loss 

This also only pertains to those same service members that have *already* applied for this lawsuit 

These service members need to CONTACT THE LAWFIRM THAT IS REPRESENTING THEM IN COURT and ask to confirm their participation even though they have already applied 

If 98% of applicants do not confirm their participation, 3M can walk away from this settlement all together

,USMC,"Does anyone else have weird dreams like this? 

I mean I don’t even smoke anymore, but I still have this dream every once in awhile where somehow I’m still active duty. Then I have to wake up and do everything all day like I’m still in, but it’s actually still me from after my EAS and I’d for sure piss hot and I know I’d be fucked. Which in turn gives me massive anxiety while sleeping until I actually wake up and realize it was just the same dream again.

Pissing hot was probably my one of my biggest fears while active, even though personally at the time I stayed as far away from anything even remotely related to it as possible, because I knew back then even being associated with anything of the sort was asking for trouble. So I never really had any “urges” while still active, nor did I even knowingly put myself into situations that would even come close to any of that. I think the fear came more from seeing others around me fail a piss test for whatever and getting booted out, which to me seemed like the easiest way to throw ones life away and that in itself was enough to make me steer clear of drugs for my entire enlistment.

I wouldn’t quantify it as a bad dream necessarily. I feel like I just don’t actually think of myself as a Marine any longer. I don’t even think I was ever that good of a Marine by any metric to begin with, maybe middle of the pack at best. More so as like a “everyone else chose to do this, and I chose to do that” or “they decided to do college, and I chose to enlist” so to speak. My 4 years of service was pretty much quite unremarkable in terms of “doing shit” (0 deployments , 1 MEU). Which really doesn’t bother me considering it was only 4 years out of my entire life of 28. I actually enjoyed being FAP’d out from my unit for six months working as OPFOR in a MOUT town outside of 62 area on Pendleton rather than I enjoyed my actual unit save for the MEU. 

Reddit and this sub are probably actually one of my last connections to the Corps in any sort of way anymore anyways, I guess you could say. 

Sometimes I think maybe it’s my subconscious trying to tell me something, or something of that sort. Maybe so? 

Anyways, I’ve been thinking about making this post for a while, but wasn’t sure how you all would feel or if anyone else ever has dreams like this as well.

I would of course like to first state that I'm only a civilian, who's closest experience to anything Marine Corps is MCJROTC (go ahead and make all the jokes you want).

With that out the way, I would like to hear about your folks experience when it comes to equipment loadouts when it comes to field exercises..etc. 

For starters, I've seen images with Infantry with M40 Gas Mask carriers in the field (outside of desert storm). I presume that was likely a required piece of equipment, but did any of you ever sham your way out of bringing it along? 

What about GeDunk and Pogey bait? Was it common to bring some some along, and if so what did you bring? 

How did you set up and utilize your Alice webbing and pack? Did you have dump pouches for empty rifle magazines? What did you bring along in your Buttpack if you used one? 

What about personnel hygiene dealing with personal hygiene in the field? As it wasn't till the 1980s that baby wipes really became widespread. Did you or anyone bring baby wipes along into the field with you?

The reasons for this is because:

,USMC,"Hi all, this is my first time posting here

I’ve had back pain since MCT, for a short summary, before I joined the military I was diagnosed with scoliosis. Doctors said it developed as I got older, at the time they said it was a mild curve. I enlisted in the military after spending a year in the DEP, MEPS noted the spine but went “eh” and still passed me through. Went to bootcamp a year later in January of 2023 when I was of age, suffered during the hikes because of my back but pushed through it since the whole “if you go the medical we will drop you”, went to MCT in May, during the final hike I felt something just immediately hurt on my ride side and lasted over 2 months during the schoolhouse. Over time it went from hella hurting to mangeable. I hit the fleet in September, because my regiment was moving around units and that I had a gym injury that lasted 3-ish weeks I never rucked anywhere so it allowed my back to not get that bad like during the summer. Fast forward to Christmas leave, I’m messing around with my friends and injure my back to the point where it felt like back in May - absolutely painful. I took pain killers (spare Motrin from a gym injury in September) to no avail. I get back this Tuesday at 2AM, yesterday I get off at like 12 since half the units on leave still. Writhing in pain still so I go to my personal trainer after work - they’re closed. I go to medical - we have an appointment for you on the 11th. Then today, I get a call from my lieutenant he asks if I’m light duty, and I tell him no but- “hey we’re short a RO so you’re going to itx in a week, you’ll be there for 5 weeks to 10 weeks”. I told him I’ve been trying to see the naval doctor here to see my back and the personal trainer since it’s been hurting horribly. He asks if I have paperwork, and I say I’m going to medical to get it. Medical refers me to PT, the PT says my spine looks absolutely curved. Like, severe was her words under her breath before she corrected herself so I wouldn’t panic or whatever. She does the whole evaluation, everything hurts and she notes it and says I need to set an appointment with an MO. I go back to medical, they say I can go to sick call tomorrow morning at 8:30 and they’ll move the appointment to… the 10th.  So I don’t know what’ll happen if I get light duty, but my Cpl later today tells me that “command decides, even if you get light duty medical has no say around here, command does”.

Idk wtf is going on but I’m gonna be so salty if I don’t pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubt anyone else is having this exact issue but if you are any advice would be great. Tbh I feel like if mol says I’m selected, I’m gonna get promoted. But who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maradmin 631/23 for reference&lt;/p&gt;

,USMC,"&gt;The Justice Department announced \[26dec23\] that is has secured a settlement against Billy Joe Goines, owner and operator of Goines Towing &amp; Recovery, based near Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, to resolve allegations that he violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) by towing and then selling vehicles without disclosing to the court that they were owned by servicemembers. \*\*\*  
&gt;  
&gt;In a complaint filed on March 3, the United States alleged that Goines auctioned off, sold or otherwise disposed of motor vehicles owned by eight servicemembers in violation of the SCRA, which provides a wide variety of financial and housing protections to members of the military. The SCRA requires a towing company to file an accurate affidavit stating whether the vehicle’s owner is in military service (i.e. a military affidavit) before it can get a court judgment authorizing it to sell a stored vehicle. If it appears that a vehicle’s owner is in military service, the court may not authorize the sale of the vehicle until it appoints an attorney to represent the interests of the servicemember. If that attorney then requests a postponement of the matter, the court must grant that request and postpone the case for at least 90 days.  The complaint here alleges that Goines either failed to file or filed inaccurate military affidavits with the court. Goines also allegedly filed military affidavits stating that he was unable to tell whether a vehicle owner was in the military even in instances where the vehicle at issue was towed from a military installation or had military decals, and instances when the vehicle owner or owner’s spouse had informed Goines of the owner’s active military service.\*\*\* [https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-north-carolina-based-towing-company-resolve-violations](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-north-carolina-based-towing-company-resolve-violations)

,USMC,"I was FAP'd out to the MPs at Cherry Point in 1998. One night one of my shift mates took me out to the grave site close to the PFT route across the road from the end of a flight line (if my memory is correct). A few of the 8 or 10 graves had the last name Buys which is an alternate spelling of my name Buijs. I always assumed they were distant relatives of my mom's family from her small town in the Netherlands.   
I just googled the graves and found out the eldest of the deceased was indeed born in the Netherlands.  Her married name  Brandt is the same as an uncle who married an aunt of mine - so possibly related on that side too.

One night one of my shift mates took me out to the grave site close to the PFT route across the road from the end of a flight line (if my memory is correct). A few of the 8 or 10 graves had the last name Buys which is an alternate spelling of my name Buijs. I always assumed they were distant relatives of my mom&amp;#39;s family from her small town in the Netherlands.&lt;br/&gt;
I just googled the graves and found out the eldest of the deceased was indeed born in the Netherlands.  Her married name  Brandt is the same as an uncle who married an aunt of mine - so possibly related on that side too.&lt;br/&gt;

 I stole stuff today from a store when I wouldn't typically. I don't know if it was an attempt to feel something/elicit some type of emotion. 

I just feel like all I am doing is existing. I called off work for a mental health day and I just feel like i'm so disconnected from everything around me.

I'm trying to get on an antidepressant but nothing seems to work well with me. I'm just on lamotrigine rn, and my psychiatrist wants me to do GeneSight which is like a genetic test to see what antidepressants would work for me. 

I'm not sure how much the GeneSight will cost with my insurance, AND I have to wait another two months until the appointment that we would even discuss an antidepressant. However, I have a feeling I REALLY need one.

 I'm not sure if this is a mixed episode or what. I feel strange, I feel different. I've felt this way before but it's rare. I feel hopeless and I don't know why.

,bipolar,"First let me tell you all that I'm on
4 different meds 2 anti depressants, a anti psychotic and a mood stabilizer 





And now she wants to add as needed med for anxiety 





Which will be the first time I've tried that type of medication. I think if I had this type of med as a prn rather than other meds I've had in the past as a prn( antihistamines and blood pressure meds) I think I would have been able to manage my life better. 





Back to the start at 13 I was dealing with being autistic in a nt world basically bur had no idea I was autistic I was super sad and depressed BECAUSE OF SOCIAL ISSUES, nothing else. I was a good student, I had hobbies and special interests. Anyway I was put on meds first anti depressant then by 14 I was on about 3 different meds anti depressant, anti psychotic and a mood stabilizer. It's been a downward spiral since then. I'll be fine for a bit then terrible again soon after. Things have just gotten worse med after med. I no longer feel like myself. I want to be me again. I haven't been me in years well 11 to be exact. I've successfully gotten myself to a good point but at this point I think the reason I am not getting better is the meds. I've already messaged my doctor about tapering off most of them except a prn for anxiety and I want to see how that goes.

4 different meds 2 anti depressants, a anti psychotic and a mood stabilizer &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now she wants to add as needed med for anxiety &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which will be the first time I&amp;#39;ve tried that type of medication. I think if I had this type of med as a prn rather than other meds I&amp;#39;ve had in the past as a prn( antihistamines and blood pressure meds) I think I would have been able to manage my life better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the start at 13 I was dealing with being autistic in a nt world basically bur had no idea I was autistic I was super sad and depressed BECAUSE OF SOCIAL ISSUES, nothing else. I was a good student, I had hobbies and special interests. Anyway I was put on meds first anti depressant then by 14 I was on about 3 different meds anti depressant, anti psychotic and a mood stabilizer. It&amp;#39;s been a downward spiral since then. I&amp;#39;ll be fine for a bit then terrible again soon after. Things have just gotten worse med after med. I no longer feel like myself. I want to be me again. I haven&amp;#39;t been me in years well 11 to be exact. I&amp;#39;ve successfully gotten myself to a good point but at this point I think the reason I am not getting better is the meds. I&amp;#39;ve already messaged my doctor about tapering off most of them except a prn for anxiety and I want to see how that goes. It&amp;#39;s going to be miserable at first I know but eventually I think I&amp;#39;ll be much happier. There is no reason in my life I should be this way. I used to be so chill and the only way I feel that way anymore is when I smoke. That&amp;#39;s the real me and I miss her.&lt;/p&gt;

Looking at my life, I'm somewhat stable. The problem is my meds kinda make me feel nothing. I still sometimes get my episodes, but therapy and meds keep them under control. What really bugs me is that big feeling of just nothing. How am I supposed to deal with ""nothing"". Nothing is fun, nothing is exciting, nothing is bad but not in a ""I don't want to live"" way, just in a.... big empty way.

Reducing my meds always resulted in big episodes with major problems (sh, losing friends etc) so my psych &amp; I agreed to keep my current medication like it is &amp; try reducing it sometime later. This really frustrates me.

The questions I can't find answers for: how am I supposed to live ""happy"" like this? Will this be my life forever? Is this feeling like being ""normal'? How do others deal with the big ""nothingness""? Is being totally insane and driven by bipolar episodes the only alternative?

,bipolar,"Bipolar is weird, sometimes you cry waterfalls literally all the time, sometimes you can't ever remember feeling sad. Sometimes you can't stop talking and sometimes you don't get out of bed for two months and can't even face another human, let alone talk to one.
Sometimes you spend loads of money online, run 10k then clean your whole apartment in the middle of the night; while reading two books, doing an online course and speaking to 4 friends at once. Then sometimes you dramatically and suddenly run out of energy, positivity and the will to live and you legit cry for 20 minutes on the kitchen floor because you ran out of washing powder and can't even do that right. You regularly entertain the fleeting thought, for just a moment, that you should give up and end it all over minor disruptions and conflict. You've probably tried to end it all at least once.
Music gives you goosebumps, the views on a hike make you cry. Other peoples pain makes your soul hurt while disapproval from others leaves you physically ill and broken up inside. Sex with you is intense and frequent, other people can't keep up. Your heart wants to burst when you see someone that you love and you have friends coming out of your ears because you overshare and people find you exciting when you're manic. Adventure is your middle name and experiencing beauty is your mission. You've written poems, made art, written diaries, played instruments, taken drugs; anything to express and explain the insurmountable overflow of pure feeling that you experience on a daily basis. You're never sure what the right choice is, you struggle with boundaries. You live in fear of psychosis, of depression, of mania. Waiting irritates you, boring people irritate you, routine irritates you, rudeness irritates you. You have periods of intense activity and suddenly periods of sleeping .All. The. Time. 
The whole time this is going on some people run away from your behaviour some people just avoid the whole diagnosis not many people understand it. You dont understand it. Everybody has their opinion on why you are like you are, what you should do about it and when you should do it. Or they patronise your disease as if it is a recurring cold that might pop up from time to time; not a daily struggle against a severe strain of influenza of the mind, behaviour and personality. You have to talk to people that you don't know a million times over about what's in your head, if you're even lucky enough to get counselling, and everybody in your life knows how weird you are because they've probably all seen you do some odd shit or be totally broken at some point in your life. You can't work full time even though you want to because you can't regulate yourself long enough to get anywhere with a career, a relationship, a hobby. You're on a constant hike of ups and downs that come out of nowhere.
Sometimes you get these weird five minutes, usually when you're tired, where you feel like you might not even exist and nothing is real and you dont know if you're crazy or not and it unsettles you for ages.
Then some days you feel like you made it all up and there's absoloutly nothing wrong with you at all and never has been.
You're trying to be a functioning adult, hold down a job, pay bills and maintain social relationships. All the time knowing that it is never going to get better and one day the medication might not work anymore. Said medication that works probably took you ten years and countless other trials to find; years of side effects, weight gain, sleepless nights, sexual dysfunction, hand tremors, dry mouth. You've probably been hospitalised at some point and felt how it feels to very publicly lose your dignity, your independence, your freedom and your mind. You want to give up sometimes but you don't, you won't, or maybe you have and it didn't work. 
Sometimes you hate this irrational disease of disregulation and sometimes you embrace the terror and unpredictability because of the pure beauty and magic it makes you feel in your soul, like a secret that only a few others are in on.
The worst thing about it is that you spend your whole life wondering where the illness ends and your personality begins.

Sometimes you can&amp;#39;t stop talking and sometimes you don&amp;#39;t get out of bed for two months and can&amp;#39;t even face another human, let alone talk to one.
Sometimes you spend loads of money online, run 10k then clean your whole apartment in the middle of the night; while reading two books, doing an online course and speaking to 4 friends at once. Then sometimes you dramatically and suddenly run out of energy, positivity and the will to live and you legit cry for 20 minutes on the kitchen floor because you ran out of washing powder and can&amp;#39;t even do that right. You regularly entertain the fleeting thought, for just a moment, that you should give up and end it all over minor disruptions and conflict. You&amp;#39;ve probably tried to end it all at least once.
Music gives you goosebumps, the views on a hike make you cry. Other peoples pain makes your soul hurt while disapproval from others leaves you physically ill and broken up inside. Sex with you is intense and frequent, other people can&amp;#39;t keep up. Your heart wants to burst when you see someone that you love and you have friends coming out of your ears because you overshare and people find you exciting when you&amp;#39;re manic. Adventure is your middle name and experiencing beauty is your mission. You&amp;#39;ve written poems, made art, written diaries, played instruments, taken drugs; anything to express and explain the insurmountable overflow of pure feeling that you experience on a daily basis. You&amp;#39;re never sure what the right choice is, you struggle with boundaries. You live in fear of psychosis, of depression, of mania. Waiting irritates you, boring people irritate you, routine irritates you, rudeness irritates you. You have periods of intense activity and suddenly periods of sleeping .All. The. Time. 
The whole time this is going on some people run away from your behaviour some people just avoid the whole diagnosis not many people understand it. You dont understand it. Everybody has their opinion on why you are like you are, what you should do about it and when you should do it. Or they patronise your disease as if it is a recurring cold that might pop up from time to time; not a daily struggle against a severe strain of influenza of the mind, behaviour and personality. You have to talk to people that you don&amp;#39;t know a million times over about what&amp;#39;s in your head, if you&amp;#39;re even lucky enough to get counselling, and everybody in your life knows how weird you are because they&amp;#39;ve probably all seen you do some odd shit or be totally broken at some point in your life. You can&amp;#39;t work full time even though you want to because you can&amp;#39;t regulate yourself long enough to get anywhere with a career, a relationship, a hobby. You&amp;#39;re on a constant hike of ups and downs that come out of nowhere.
Sometimes you get these weird five minutes, usually when you&amp;#39;re tired, where you feel like you might not even exist and nothing is real and you dont know if you&amp;#39;re crazy or not and it unsettles you for ages.
Then some days you feel like you made it all up and there&amp;#39;s absoloutly nothing wrong with you at all and never has been.
You&amp;#39;re trying to be a functioning adult, hold down a job, pay bills and maintain social relationships. All the time knowing that it is never going to get better and one day the medication might not work anymore. Said medication that works probably took you ten years and countless other trials to find; years of side effects, weight gain, sleepless nights, sexual dysfunction, hand tremors, dry mouth. You&amp;#39;ve probably been hospitalised at some point and felt how it feels to very publicly lose your dignity, your independence, your freedom and your mind. You want to give up sometimes but you don&amp;#39;t, you won&amp;#39;t, or maybe you have and it didn&amp;#39;t work.

Ok, so, I imagine other people have had their therapist think things are worse off than you think things are. How accurate do you find that is? Mine thinks things are definitely better than last year, but is still pretty concerned.

To the point of suggesting I re-visit the idea of ECT with my psych nurse.

I broke up with my boyfriend while manic and all oh I deserve the world kinda shit so I came into this depression alone, I can barely stop crying. I was crying so much at work that I had to quit. I had a housemate but they wigged out and left then told me I was ruining their life and making them want to kill themselves. 

Then one of my friends goes to my ex boyfriend and tells her things I apparently told her about him (mania/alcohol induced loose lips I’m guessing) and he has never been so unhappy with anyone the entire time I’ve known him, it’s breaking me to be the only person I’ve ever seen him dislike so much. 

The friend then goes on to start sending me a bunch of abuse which makes me feel like an emotional punching bag. 

Meanwhile a girl from the job I quit started hanging out with a guy who hated me and clearly their bitching about me led to him sending me a 15 paragraph email about what a terrible person I am.

Now my sleeping schedule is really fucked up, I have no friends left, I’m single and I have no job and no way of paying the bills. I’m waiting for the doctors to reassess my medication but it’s taking months and months.

,bipolar,"When I saw my psychiatrist in November, she upped my Lamtical to 300mg. She told me then that she wanted to put me back on another SSRI, but from where the Prozac literally almost turned my brain to total mush, and she was about to take an extended vacation, she didn't want to risk me needing something from her, and me having to deal with a different psych. The irony of the last part of that statement is that I found out from my therapist during my last session was that my psych is leaving the practice soon so I'm getting a new psych either way. On top of that, I'm also losing my therapist at the end of this month, which is *fantastic* because that means I get to rehash my whole life story all over again to two complete strangers. 

The indifferent feelings started last week. I originally chalked it up to my depressive episode at the time, but as the week went on and I became manic, I knew that, that wasn't the cause. The only way I can describe the feeling is like I'm burnt out with portions of my life; like some things have grown monotonous even though they're not. At the same time, I also catching myself running on autopilot, disassociating with myself, feeling like I'm not making any sense when I'm talking, and just feeling all out of sorts. I just feel kinda numb to the things around me, even though I don't want to feel that way. Honestly, because of these feelings, I've had a few drinks in the last week. I know it's not a good idea with my medication, but I just want to *feel something*, and I haven't been doing it in excess; it's just a drink or two every few nights. 

I don't understand why it started either. Things in my life has been going great. I got engaged on Christmas, my baby is hitting milestones what seems like every single day, I may be up for a promotion at my job; things that should be making me ecstatic seem like they're mundane and honestly, it upsets me in a way. I don't want to be like this because I don't want it affecting the things around me, and it makes me feel like a failure as a mother, as a partner, and as a human being. It also worries me because honestly, this could be a sign that I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown and I just don't truly realize it. If that happens then I really don't know how I'm going to handle it because it could ruin absolutely everything that I have going for me currently. 

My next appointment with my psych is in February, and honestly, if I still feel like this then, I doubt she'll be much help to me; especially since she's pushing for that SSRI despite me telling her no multiple times after the Prozac incident; honestly, I was telling her no before that, but she basically made it seem like that it was that, or I'd just have to deal with upping the Lamictal. I'd call my psych's office to see if they could let me talk to someone else, but my health insurance is currently in limbo. I asked my dad to drop me off of his because I started receiving Medicaid while I was pregnant, and my Medicaid won't approve any treatments or prescriptions currently because they're claiming I'm still covered through my dad's insurance, even though my dad's insurance says I'm not. Up until the 1st, my dad's insurance was my primary, so everything had to be run through them first before Medicaid would pick up the rest; hence why they're not approving anything because my healthcare providers are trying to bill everything solely to my Medicaid now. 

I'm just dealing with it for now I guess. Hopefully I'll get the insurance thing worked out within the next week, and if I don't, then I have no idea what I'll do. I have a therapy appointment on the 22nd, so maybe I can talk to her and see if she has any recommendations on how to deal with this; that is, if it's still a problem by that point.

,bipolar,"So I’ve struggled with what I thought was MDD, GAD, and panic disorder for most of my life. I was put on SSRIs as a teenager, which led to a suicide attempt, and then promptly taken off of them. I refused to try any other medications again for years. 

Those few years were so hectic for me. Some days I felt like I could do anything, be anything, and sometimes I wouldn’t even want to get out of bed. I spent money irresponsibly, I picked fights, I started countless hobbies that I never kept up with. I started every job with a bang and excitement but would eventually get irritated and depressed and quit within a year. My longest job was 2 years, and that’s only because when I would try to quit my boss would tell me to take some time off first. 

Fast forward to now, after what seemed like an amazing period in my life (I fell in love, I picked up more hobbies, I spent thousands of dollars and had a full social calendar for months), the fall came. This time it was bad, and I let my therapist and psychiatrist put me on an SSRI, Zoloft. 

Within a week, this induced absolute hell for me. This mania was awful—delusional, nightmare-fueled, and painful. I ended up in a psych ward with a tentative Bipolar diagnosis.

,bipolar,"“Look at the bright side,” is something my mother always said to me. Its something I say to others and they often get upset like I’m invalidating their feelings but this approach works for me.

I recently read “Owning Bipolar,” by Michael Pipich and Joseph Shrand. In the book he describes mania/hypomania as the brain’s tool for pulling ourselves out of depression. It really made sense to me as my strongest hypomanic episodes have all come following the lowest lows.

After reading this, my eternal optimism made a little more sense to me. Whenever something negative happens I try to find the positives to keep me from falling into a low.

My girlfriend hates when I try to look at the bright side for her problems. But, when something happens I could be upset at her about, she loves how quickly I can get over it by seeing the good and empathizing with her remorse. She feels so loved and returns that love in amazing ways.

,bipolar,"I have been diagnosed with Bipolar II for around a year now, but have been struggling with increasingly worsening symptoms since I started high school (I’m currently getting my Master’s, so it’s been for a while). I struggle a lot with med-compliance, and I was off my bipolar medication at the end of last year. I had what I believe to be my first true manic episode with psychotic symptoms on the last day of the previous year. I believed the CIA was after me, thought that birds were drones for the government, that car license plates were codes that would help keep them from capturing me, etc. etc. Fortunately, I didn’t do anything embarrassing or damaging, since part of the delusion was the knowledge that if I let anyone know what I was thinking, that they would check me into a mental hospital and I would no longer know that the CIA was after me, which is exactly what they wanted (I, of course, fully believed that the thoughts I was having were real). It was very obvious to the people around me that something was wrong, but nobody knew what is was until I told them what had happened afterwards. 

I mention the date this happened because that’s was the last day of my health insurance, which is what made me hesitate to go to the psych ward (that, and the horror stories I’ve heard). I had asked my boyfriend and roommate if they believed I should spend some time in the ward, since I was terrified of this happening again, but they also didn’t seem to know what to do (which makes sense - I don’t think either of them had ever expected this to happen). I did go back on my medication and am still currently on it, but it’s a new medication and I’m on a really low dose of it, so I felt like there was a chance it wouldn’t do too much. I didn’t end up going to the psych ward, and now I’m worried it was the wrong decision. 

So I guess my question is - I have a psych appointment in about two weeks, and I was unsure if I should reschedule it to sometime sooner so that I can talk to my psych about all of this, especially since it’s been on my mind constantly since it’s happened. Also, if something like this were to happen again, should I go to a psych ward?

,bipolar,"My fiancée and I have been engaged for almost two years now. Our wedding is at the end of this month—it was originally scheduled for January ‘23 but I flew to Hawaii in a manic state, cheated on her (and 2 days later told her about it in graphic detail), and wound up breaking a sliding glass door and getting thrown in an Oahu jail for almost a month. While in jail I experienced intense hallucinations; it wasn’t until my 3rd week when I finally started eating and sleeping and looking forward to when I’d be able to call for bail. 

My manic state didn’t end there, but continued after my fiancée flew to Hawaii, bailed my ass out, and brought me home. I was still drinking and smoking and my lingering hypomania had my ass in a boxing gym for an hour every morning. 

Fast forward to now—after a year of experimenting (olanzapine brought me out of the manic state but also zombified me for 6 months after) with meds, finding a good balance for them and finding an empathetic therapist to talk to weekly, 13 months sober, I’m finally at a place where we’re super stoked to get married, I’ve done the emotional work of apologizing to family and partner and friends about ‘22’s manic debacle. 

But now that we’re so close to everything I find myself awake for long hours of the night. My lamictal is only giving me 4 hours of sleep. My brain I can tell is picking up speed. It is promising, it seems, to continue to do so.  We also, about 6 weeks ago, found out that we are going to be parents(!!!—we’re in our mid 30s so we are thrilled af). Due date is seven months post wedding. 

I also  recently (about two weeks ago) started a drug for ADHD—atomoxetine. Does anyone have any experience with this + lamictal?

My fiancée is starting to notice the late hours and the increase in # of N.A. beers consumed and is starting to snowball with worry that another manic episode is imminent and approaching fast. I try to be consoling but she says I can’t be objective about my own mental health. 

Idk guys I just needed to vent, and also air out these fears that I’m indeed hypomanic. There’s so many events of epic proportion in my life right now that it’s like—how could I not help but be a little extra extra happy with a gorgeous ceremony and a baby on the way?

I know Reddit isn’t a panel of psychiatrists but would love some feedback yall. 

What can I do to better assuage my partner’s fears? Am I heading toward another manic tornado or am I just experiencing life’s deeper joys in their due course?

,bipolar,"TW: SI &amp; references to drug use

I had a meeting with my mental health advisor yesterday and I majorly overshared. I was a bit off kilter to begin with stress has made my sleeping erratic, I quit and then resumed vaping in quick succession, been in a weird place mentally. 

I've been considering suicide a lot recently, got a vague idea of when, been sorting out letters, but Ive been working very hard to make sure that I'm not acting on the basis of an emotional state that's going to pass and that I'm considering every option before hand and reaching out for all available help. I showed up to the meeting with a list of things I wanted to talk about, such as reaccessing therapy and my recent ideation/planning. 

When I got there I just couldnt make myself shut up, I was rambling off topic, had an irrepressible paranoia about the notes she was writing, my christmas drug use, wanting to drop out of uni to become a poet, some other stuff that I cant even remember now. She said she wanted to get in touch with my psychiatric team quite urgently, offered to sort out exceptional circumstances with my university and I wouldn't shut up about how ""I might be exceptional but I don't know if the circumstances are"".

I left and not three hours later I get calls from the psychiatric team (and if you know the NHS this is wildly prompt). I had to beg them not to send me anywhere because of upcoming exams. I spent the rest of the evening fielding calls from the mental health rapid response service and my psych team and making a fool of myself over text.

,bipolar,"Hi everyone,

I had a severe manic episode / nervous breakdown from my job back in July. I had a high stress job that consumed my life. After about a month of coming down from my episode, I started my job again. But quit a week later because it started consuming my life again.

I feel guilty because the job was high paying. Everyone told me to quit because they could see it was burning me out.

Now, I feel like I am still recovering from the nervous breakdown and manic episode. My therapist says I’m not ready for work again because I tend to place my whole self worth on a job. My psychiatrist agrees that I need the rest after doing what I was doing for so long.

Here’s the thing, I can’t stop feeling guilty for not working and for having the manic episode. I am trying to practice self compassion like my therapist says, but still have this underlying guilt that im not working (even though my doctors agree that I should stay off for a bit).

I get so bored - I know I should be thankful that I have the means to take time off from work, but I am having so many mixed emotions.

Has anyone gone through anything similar after a manic episode?

,bipolar,"Hey everyone!

We wanted to announce our changes for 2024 and some general housekeeping stuff.

# Rules

We have decided to refine our rules to remove any ambiguities in the past as we move forward in 2024.

In order, we have the following:

**Rule 1:** **Friends/Family/Medical Professionals**

* This is still a Peer-Support community.
   * Non-peer users will now receive 1 warning for posting in r/bipolar
      * If a warned user continues to post/comment, they will be permanently banned

   Note: Users may appeal this ban, but the ban will stand if they are not a peer.  

**Rule 2:** **Asking for Diagnosis/Diagnosing**

* Med Reviews. We are working on another write-up for this to make the guidelines clear to everyone. Until we can do so, please refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/151mcog/regarding_questions_about_medications/)

**Rule 3: Discouraging Professional Treatment**

* No changes here.

**Rule 4: Civility**

* Highlighting that this also applies to modmail.

**Rule 5-12**

* No Changes to these rules. 

**Rule 13: Use Search/Mega Thread/ Theme Day**

* Update on what the Theme Days are. Please continue to use the search function and the links on the sidebar for popular community topics; this makes it easier for someone to find the most relevant information to their question in the future.
   * Use Search/Mega Thread/Theme Days:
      * Use the search/sidebar links for frequent topics
      * Active Community Discussions (On Going)
         * To be posted the first week of the month.
      * Manic Monday
      * Weekly Music Thread
      * Wellness Wednesday
      * Feel Good Friday
         * Includes standalone memes, non-original art, and infographic posts.

**Rule 14: General Guidelines**

* The catch-all...sadly...
   * Limiting post/comment length to 3500 characters
      * Posts/Comments over 2000 characters will be reviewed by the moderation team
      * Enforcing line breaks on longer posts.
         * When using Reddit on a desktop, users will receive a notification and be prevented from submitting until line breaks are added
         * For mobile, users will receive a message from AutoMod requesting that line breaks be added to the post. 

**Rule 15: Counter-Moderation**

* Any attempts to deliberately counteract the actions of the moderation team may result in a ban. Includes (but is not limited to) reposting removed content, attempting to circumvent AutoModerator or other moderation mechanisms, and using non-standard characters to try to get around Automod.
* Please don't DM the Mods individually about the community.
   * Send Modmail or use the Suggestion Jar for moderation matters.

When her medication is stable she is somewhat paranoid but nothing too major that inhibits her from interacting with us.

,schizophrenia,"  

Hi! I am diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia since more than 20 years and before getting sick, I was in very good shape. I was prescribed Zypexa and I gained a lot of weight. I know meds can do that. I’m not on Zyprexa anymore as they switched to a combination of Risperdal and Abilify.

I am no longer in shape, however a friend recommended that I look at Dr. Chris Palmer: Diet &amp; Nutrition for Mental Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #99

In this podcast, Dr. Chris Palmer (psychiatrist) suggests that a keto diet could improve mental health and help to lose weight.

I tried keto and lost about 5 kg in less than 3 months. I’m not on a keto diet anymore but I feel much more lucid, energetic, motivated and confident, and since I know more how to eat to prevent weight gain, my weight is relatively stable at -5kg.

,schizophrenia,"Hey yall, basically I’m looking for advice on my situation, I’m not sure if this break up is a result of a lack of medication and how I should I handle the situation moving forward. 



My ex gf has schizophrenia and has not been able to take her medication for quite some time due to insurance dropping her. She was gradually getting worse with the symptoms ( zoning out, audio and visual hallucinations, adisorganized behavior,anxiety). But I didn’t mind and would let her ride it out and give her support where I could.  

Just weeks ago we were having a good time and I even got her a promise ring she wanted. She recently got really cold and broke up with me saying she feels overwhelmed with all the stuff going on in life. 



When we  talked a few days after the breakup so I could get closure she got upset and was saying that I was telling lots people of people  about our relationship. I have only told one person, my close friend and it was just about how I was feeling sad about losing her. I am worried she might be having delusions? 


I understand where she is coming from about feeling overwhelmed and I respect it. But I can’t help but think that this breakup is almost induced by her mental illness not being treated :(

So my brother is completely crazy, and dangerous. He has been like this since 2020, he has been in the psych ward several times, but they always sent him back, they gave him all the reports because he is an adult.
This is the biggest problem, we can't force him to take medication, or to be under any treatment, because the hungarian goverment sees him as a healthy adult, who is able to make his own choices.
We have no clue what to do, his condition is getting worse and worse and he is very violent.
We cant make him take medication, the psych ward sent him back several times, and he makes living a nightmare, we are clueless, so if any of you guys have an idea, a story or anything that could help, it would be much appreciated.

They cry because &amp;quot;I AM GOD IN MY OWN MIND&amp;quot;... not what big dogs what you to think, but anyway. They cry and they cry and they don&amp;#39;t FUCK withme anymore. God damn. I think the thoughts. The thoughts will wear off sometime. Hope I could help you all... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;someone will finally get the true truth that you need to be treated like a human rather then a broken figure for the treatment. why hasn&amp;#39;t this been thought of? I dunno.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing to say thank you.

I carry alot of guilt and shame.

Not only over my condition, but over the things I've done both to - and infront- of people.

I am at work stewing in the thought of ""what do they think of me.""

I had a psychiatric symptom breakdown a few weeks ago infront of my coworkers.

At times, it's tough sitting in the presence of others.

When I am struggling, I think of the broken/ mutilated toys of toy story.

The toys live in the dark, hidden in Sids room.

The toys accept all toys that are broken and mutilated.

There is a scene in which the toys actively accept another toy that was mutilated by Sid...

Its a tear jerker because the newly mutilated toy shows extreme emotion over being accepted, being shown love, and having a community to call home

,schizophrenia,"I'm seeing a therapist because I like getting different angles of thought from various people.  A therapist has seen a lot of patients which would give them more angles than a normal person would.  Finding a way of thinking that I would have never thought of before has opened avenues of beneficial therapy and recovery.  Recovery being something helpful in my life that was not currently there.

Now when I started talking to my therapist about why I couldn't get things done, she gave me the normal routine of ""Well you got to try harder.""  We know in schizophrenics with negative symptoms that this is not possible.  There are moments of remission and often those negative symptoms come right back with time, this is why things don't get done.  I was somewhat baffled by her response when I realized she must have not had experience with schizophrenics.

So, I did the simplest thing, looked up what therapies are used for schizophrenics.  After a quick web search, I found that only two therapies are used for schizophrenia, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and Acceptance Therapy.  CBT is very common but I looked up Acceptance Therapy Therapists in my area, there were none.

I found Acceptance on a day of suicidal thinking.  Never could I figure out why I was unable to compare to my peers, it haunted me for 16 years.  Until it came to me while I was crying, I said to myself, ""I am not a capable person because my brain has a dysfunction, I accept this and move on.""  My depression of 16 years was lifted and has not returned after 3.5 years.

How can it be that Acceptance of who we are not be the most common therapy.  Knowing who we are is the most important thing we could recognize.

I am somewhat stuck now.  I believe that therapy has benefits but what happens when the therapist doesn't understand what schizophrenia is even about.  My past psychiatrist of 19 years did psychotherapy along with medicating, which is recommended for schizophrenics.  He died this past year of cancer, he was a great doctor and a great man.  Since he is gone, I am stuck with professionals that don't understand.

I'm left with nothing but myself to find a way through mentally, it's lonely and void of hope.

&lt;p&gt;Now when I started talking to my therapist about why I couldn&amp;#39;t get things done, she gave me the normal routine of &amp;quot;Well you got to try harder.&amp;quot;  We know in schizophrenics with negative symptoms that this is not possible.  There are moments of remission and often those negative symptoms come right back with time, this is why things don&amp;#39;t get done.  I was somewhat baffled by her response when I realized she must have not had experience with schizophrenics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I did the simplest thing, looked up what therapies are used for schizophrenics.  After a quick web search, I found that only two therapies are used for schizophrenia, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and Acceptance Therapy.  CBT is very common but I looked up Acceptance Therapy Therapists in my area, there were none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found Acceptance on a day of suicidal thinking.  Never could I figure out why I was unable to compare to my peers, it haunted me for 16 years.  Until it came to me while I was crying, I said to myself, &amp;quot;I am not a capable person because my brain has a dysfunction, I accept this and move on.&amp;quot;  My depression of 16 years was lifted and has not returned after 3.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can it be that Acceptance of who we are not be the most common therapy.  Knowing who we are is the most important thing we could recognize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am somewhat stuck now.  I believe that therapy has benefits but what happens when the therapist doesn&amp;#39;t understand what schizophrenia is even about.  My past psychiatrist of 19 years did psychotherapy along with medicating, which is recommended for schizophrenics.  He died this past year of cancer, he was a great doctor and a great man.  Since he is gone, I am stuck with professionals that don&amp;#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m left with nothing but myself to find a way through mentally, it&amp;#39;s lonely and void of hope.  How am I to rely on myself for so much when I am not capable of so much.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hey guys! I hope you all had a wonderful holiday and new year. I know mine was pretty alright. 

Well anyways. I’m an avid writer and have written in my journal almost every day since my senior year of HS. That was 12 years ago! Anyways I started reading these and it has made me feel things I don’t like. 

It was fun at first living through HS drama and such again, but as I kept reading the more disappointed I have become with where I am now. 

I wasn’t diagnosed with schizophrenia till I was 20 and about 1/2 through college. I just seems like the only things I’ve accomplished since then was graduating with a MA in political science and marrying my wife (my college sweetheart). 

It’s just like the trajectory of my life was irrevocably altered by my schizophrenia. I only work part time at an outdoors store cause I can’t really handle more than that. I try to help around the house, but that is hard some days. 

I’m just on the struggle bus right now and I don’t know how to get off. How do I overcome this feeling that I haven’t accomplished almost anything I wanted to when I was younger. I imagined myself being in a completely different place 10 years ago. I had so many hopes and dreams. Some could still happen I suppose, but the ship has sailed on most things .

,schizophrenia,"Hey, new to this subreddit but not to schizophrenia (diagnosed 7 years ago, 4 major psychotic episodes)

I am recently discovering that my antipsychotic medications contribute to addictive behaviours (I had/have a severe addiction to cocaine and other stimulants, then there’s also binge eating, online shopping, smoking.. a lot of addictive behaviours that have been out of control since starting antipsychotics)

I stopped taking abilify recently and my cravings for these “extras” stopped. I didn’t crave cocaine at all. I stopped smoking altogether. It was awesome, I felt like my old self from before my diagnosis. But then, of course, I had an episode of psychosis and had to start taking a high dose of abilify again.

Are there any non-prescription alternatives to treating schizophrenia like therapy or something? I’m stuck. I don’t want to have these addictions, cocaine has ruined my life, but I definitely can’t live in psychosis. 😔

Other medications I’ve tried are: latuda and olanzipine. These were even worse. When I switched to a very low dose of abilify, I had a little balance.. but I need it to be better than this.

Any recommendations of meds or non-prescription solutions I can take to my psychiatrist for discussion? TIA

,schizophrenia,"Hi everyone-I'm a current PhD student at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). Over the past few years I've run studies looking at how people learn about and understand emotions, and how experiences of psychosis might influence these processes.

I'm running the third version on an online study for individuals 18 and older that regularly have unusual experiences such as hearing or seeing things others don't, feeling watched or followed, or having thoughts that don't quite make sense. At this time, the study is only available to US residents.

This study is completed entirely online. You will answer questions about your background, complete three tasks about emotions, and fill out questionnaires about your current thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This study will last approximately 45-60 minutes.

,schizophrenia,"Hey guys, hope you are doing well and are having a nice friday. I have a question I was hoping somebody here might be able to help me with. 

My brother has had schizophrenia for a couple of years now and has been on and off medication with psychotic episodes of varying degrees. Recently, he has had himself repeatedly hosptialized for conditions (mainly shortage of breath, sometimes heart palpatations) that he attributes to swelling within his neck. He claims this swelling is caused by an underlying thyroid condition called Hashimoto syndrome that he has been diagnosed with and is actively taking medication against. However, none of the multiple doctors that he has been to see have been able to confirm this or diagnose any other ongoing condition. Is it possible he is just imagining his conditions? He does (probably rightly so) blame past stays in psychiatric hospitals for other health problems he's had in the past and while I fully understand his distrust of the medical system that has done him wrong in the past, the fact that multiple doctors have failed in diagnosing anything does confuse me.

Do things like this happen? Is it feasible that he is having something like a panic attack and being delusional about the actual symptoms? I really want to help him but we live in different countries and it is hard for me to tell sometimes what exactly is going on, as he communicates very unclearly.

Hi all,

Are you interested in taking part in some research? I am completing this research as part of my training as a Trainee Clinical Psychologist at Salomons Institute of Applied Psychology (Canterbury Christ Church University). 

We hope to learn more about the effect of the timing of childhood adversities on people’s later experiences of psychotic-like experiences, through their narratives. The purpose of this study is also to get a better understanding of factors that may be protective during adverse experiences and factors that contribute to managing these experiences.  

Participants will be asked to talk about the past and difficult experiences, which can bring about distressing or intense emotions. Therefore, we ask you to consider if this would negatively impact on your wellbeing.

**Who can participate?**  
\- Aged 18+  
\- English as a first language  
\- People who have faced adversity in childhood (before 18 years)  
\- Experienced voices, visions, unusual or unshared beliefs (sometimes referred to as ‘psychosis’ or psychotic-like experiences) in adulthood

*Childhood adversity could be, but not restricted to: experiencing/witnessing physical, sexual, emotional abuse, violence at home, war, natural disasters, poverty, family breakdown, crime, parental/carer/ sibling illness or death, bullying, moving country.*

*Psychotic-like experiences could be, but not restricted to: Auditory hallucinations (often referred to as voice hearing), Visual hallucinations (Or seeing visions) Unusual beliefs, Confusing or rapidly changing thoughts, Disrupted or constant speech.*

**What will I need to do? (2 stages)**  

1. Brief phone call:  
\- To establish eligibility for the study  
\- To get some more information
2. Virtual Interview:  
\- 60-90 minute virtual interview where you will be ask to tell your life story  
\- You will be asked to share difficult experiences in childhood and psychotic-like experiences  
\- This will be audio recorded.

This study has been approved by the Salomons Ethics Panel (Salomons Institute for Applied Psychology, Canterbury Christ Church University) on 13th July 2023.

,schizophrenia,"Hi, I’m Basil and I’m 16NB . I’m currently in highschool (11th grade) and I just wanted some advice on how to manage school with psychosis. 

I don’t have schizophrenia as a diagnosis but my therapist thinks I should . So we’re working on that which is why I’m posting here. 

Recently, I’ve been having really bad auditory and visual hallucinations. I can’t concentrate in school, I can’t stay organized, and even talking and gathering my thoughts has been harder than usual. 

I stayed home from school today because I was stressed but I was yelled at and threatened by parents. 

How do you guys manage to go to school with schizophrenia or psychosis? 

I was considering being a drop out and just getting my GED. However, I have only a year left of highschool so there’d rlly be no point. 

I also go to a behavioral school for kids with behavioral issues or mental issues (not sure if that’s the right word to use.) so do what you will with that info. I’m also already on anti psychotic I believe, have been for three years. However, it doesn’t work anymore and nobody will up the dose for me :(

My episode was feeling an immense fear something happened to my daughter.

I have been able to logically disprove every fear I have ever had except this one. Because how could I disprove something at that level of a cosmic anomaly. 

I am suffering immensely because I can’t logic this away; I can’t face it and go, “So what?” Because so what is my child is suffering and calling out for me and needs me and I can never get to her. I can’t live with that.
