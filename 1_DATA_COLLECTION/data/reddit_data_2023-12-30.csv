,Army,"Cheif recently informed my platoon that the Army is ceasing all funding and operations for our MOS of 15W (UAS operator for the RQ7 Shadow) in 3 months firm. He talked us through some of the possibilities of what may become of us, but as for now nothing is certain. Big Army was originally planning on replacing the Shadow platform in 2027 with something else, but this news came out of nowhere and way ahead of schedule. None of the experimental platforms they're considering are ready yet, so our MOS will most likely cease to exist.

Some of the possibilities he talked about included MOS swapping us to another 15 series MOS or something else entirely, getting put into ""admin positions"" within the Battalion or Brigade (basically being a detail bitch for the rest of our contracts), or equipping us with commercially available quadcopters and having us roll with infantry platoons (sounds unlikely). But it's all guess work.

What he didn't mention was the possibility of an early ETS, probably so we don't get our hopes up. What are the chances of that, based on the precedents when these kind of things happen (surely this isn't the first time a MOS specific platform is prematurely cut). If they try to reclass me, am I able to deny it and get out early? If so, what kind of discharge would I be looking at?

It's a 6 year contract and I have 3 years left. Plenty of time to retrain and fill another position, but I signed up this and only this. Why should I spend the next 3 years doing a job I didn't sign up for because Big Army changed the terms of the deal at no fault of my own? Most other MOS's come with only a 3 or 4 year contract, the 6 years for 15W is said to be because ""of the time and cost of the training"", training which is now irrelevant.

,Army,"I am a German Citizen and live in Germany so I apologize for any mistakes. I think my problem might be partially a civil matter but I just dont know what to do anymore and was hoping maybe somebody has a helpful tip.

So my story is that my exhusband (E6) has not paid Child Support for over six years. Well, he has dfas set up that the monthly amount is being send to a joint bank account of us that I didnt have access to for all those years and he has been taking it from this account the whole time. Back in the day I did try to get in contact with the Army and talked to his Chain of command but for some reason I stopped getting responses so I gave up. This time I was not backing down and got in contact with the IG Office in April last year. They got me in contact with his Captain and after a couple of emails the Captain didnt respond to me anymore. I tried my best to explain that yes the money is being send to the agreed account (an allotment was set up because there were problems of him not paying before) but 1. I dont have access to it anymore because he changed all the passwords and I am not able to get a new card because it would have been shipped to his address and he sure as hell would not send it to me and 2. He has been taking the money a couple of days after arriving. So after some waiting time I got in contact with the IG Office again and then got the email address of his Lieutenant Colonel. So I explained everything and same thing happened. He even said to the Lt Col that I was solely on this bank account and i send her proof that that wasnt true but she still stopped responding to me. 

I unterstand I am just some annoying ex wife and i always wanted to make sure I expressed how grateful I was to get a response and that I am sorry for taking important time of someones day but I just want this issue to be resolved. I dont want to sue for Child Support and all the years he missed and ruin his life. I only care about now and that it works. I also wouldnt contact all those people if he would just talk to me and figure things out.
So after all that I once again contacted the bank and was lucky to have someone assigned to me that said "" I dont think it's right to have your name on something you dont have access to"" and I was finally able to have a banking card send to me in Germany and online banking set up. 
So I was able to receive the money in November. My exhusband then contacted the bank and said it was fraud and they send a credit while they we're investigating the issue. I called them right away and told them it was me that did it and they took the credit back. Now the problem was that because he said it was fraud my card got deactivated and a new one send out. Of course because of the holidays I wasnt expecting much and the card wasnt there at the end of december. So the money from dfas came and he took it right away putting the account at 0,00$. Okay great I thought from now on it will be a game on who is faster but I still wanted to know If my card was on the way so I contacted the bank and got told that he closed the account and when the new card arrives i can just cut it up and dispose it.

I am exhausted and really dont know what to do anymore.

I heard the cyber corp is highly sought after, and other than my recommendations and the intermediate python course I took in college, I don&amp;#39;t feel like I have that much of a leg up. For the medical services, I was originally planning for medical school, so I took a lot of medical classes, just didn&amp;#39;t want to keep wasting money on school, so this corp also interests me. And the chemical corp I think is pretty self explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any recommendations or advice, possibly some contacts within these corps that I can get some more information from would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

That\'s where this [fucking nerd](https://media0.giphy.com/media/A9KfKenpqNDfa/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e476jgwq0kipfh55xiwgtelrf3zfbytrdo1gktp7psh&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g) comes in! The second link has some of my data breakdowns.\n\nWhen filtered by branch, a lot of the questions had trends that matched the overall answers. I didn\'t spend time making separate graphs for those because it looks the same as all the answers combined. The branches match, the only difference is how many in each branch answered the question. Booooooooring. Without further ado, the results!\n\n[Military Subreddit Census 2023 Results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JxkwKNacCGXIs1Ys-1ppZGl75XFWDh4nsyYGlSbgBbs/viewanalytics)\n\nWelcome back from your research. Here\'s the deal, I fully realize that this little ~~fetish~~ census is flawed in several fashions. Here\'s my shit list of all the ways I fucked this year\'s census up. If any of you have suggestions for next year that I haven\'t already discussed, hit up my inbox. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)\n\n* I only noticed that I didn\'t include a question asking which branch you\'re a part of after 13 people already submitted answers. Fixed it live from my phone, but still.\n* My dumbass listed warrant ranks as CW-02 instead of CWO-2.\n* I busted my own deadlines! Sinceriously sorry about that. I vastly overestimated my bandwidth and writing this up repeatedly fell to the bottom of the to do list.\n\nAnyways, now that I\'ve taken some time to look a bit deeper than face value at all this data here\'s what I\'ve found.\n\n# Basic Facts\n\n* Y\'all made 1,123 submissions. The ratio of branch submissions shaped how most questions were answered. In most charts, the disparity of answers per branch matched the disparity below. I only bothered making my own charts if I saw a trend that broke from this mold.\n   * Air Force: 462\n   * Army: 258\n   * Coast Guard: 85\n   * Marine Corps: 69 ^(nice)\n   * Navy: 107\n   * Space Force: 70 ^(tried too hard for nice)\n   * Blank: 72\n* I didn\'t make a chart for the question regarding your unit encouraging attending sick call or medical appointments, but I did notice something unique. The Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, and Space Force all increased in submissions as the likelihood of encouraging attendance increased from 1 to 5. The Navy was about even across 1 to 3, but did have more submissions for 4 and 5 proportional to the other services. Then, the Marine Corps were roughly equal in submissions across all 5! They really are a cult. Look, real talk for a moment. Don\'t sacrifice your body for your service if you\'re supporting peace time ops. And if you do, don\'t chaff getting rated with the VA as if you didn\'t earn it. Y\'all take care of yourselves!\n* Also, there were a few questions that I thought were easy pickings for branch comparisons even if the Google Forms results don\'t show it that way. I\'ve made a little imgur gallery for six of them that y\'all can check out [here](https://imgur.com/a/xgKqDEd). Probably fun for the number nerds out there but I\'m not sure who else gets down like that, so...\n\n# Generals\n\n* Three of you claim to be generals in our midst! One is plausible... but the other ""two"" I\'m not so sure about. While all three ages match (50+), two of y\'all are AH-64 Apaches serving as ""Class IX"" employees in the Army, commissioning with a degree in cunnilingus, would rather fight 3x other generals than other ranks, use condoms 24/7 as COVID preventative measures, claimed spanking as their highest form of punishment (though I have a feeling it wasn\'t punishment for the receiver since their favorite form of supervisors correcting troops without paperwork is using ball gags), and would implement Titty Tuesday if they were \\[AH-64 Apache\\] For a Day. You know, just your based pervert, basically.\n* On second thought I think the plausible one is probably u/SilentD testing the submission form... so no Generals this time around. Don\'t worry, you can be my Lieutenant General anytime, boo! o7\n* Also, there\'s something to be said about our willingness to pose anonymously as any of the General ranks... but not a single soul nutted up to be a CWO-5. Y\'all know you\'d get force choked even thinking about it, haha.\n\n# Levels of Punishment\n\n* You know, I think the one who listed \'marriage\' and another who listed \'heavy spanking at home\' should probably get together.\n* More than a couple of you got \'your balls smoked off\' or some variation like \'Just had my ass smoked. Made 20-year old me sit down and take a breather like a 45 year old at their first BJJ practice,\' lol. I appreciates handling the situation old fashioned and off the books.\n* There was a fair amount of extra duty and paperwork for juniors and seniors being on an episode of When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong. Good reads if y\'all wanted to grab some shovels.\n* The Marine Corps had the lowest \'None\' and \'Verbal\' responses among the branches, but the highest \'Extra Duty\' and \'Administrative Paperwork\', with the second highest \'Article 15\'. Conversely, the Space Force had the highest \'None\'. I think we all saw those coming a mile away, lol.\n\n# THERE I WAS...\n\nI handle the THERE I WAS question Clint Eastwood style through the categories of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. The Good are tales that are lighthearted, funny, or of benefit to the storyteller. The Bad are tales of fucking up somewhere in the chain and leaves a downer taste in your mouth. The Ugly are tales that give me a bit of a cringe as I read them. These responses are cherry picked exactly as submitted; no edits have been made.\n\n* The Good\n   * When I first check on my ship they put us in an overflow berthing where marines were supposed to stay. They‚Äôre was HUGE dent in one of the bigger stand up lockers. After about a month someone had the video of happened, several marines used a singular marine as a battering ram and slammed his in the locker several times without a helmet. The also broke all of washer and dryers on board in a similar way with the writing of ‚Äúbroken courtesy of the USMC""\n   * Baghdad 2007, walk in fresh off the plane, Army Col looks up, sees me, says ""come with me."" Go into a section, he yells for the SFC, who comes running. He tells the SFC, ""This is SSgt XXX, he is your new section chief. Understood!?"" SFC replies yes. I didnt get it then, but within two weeks, it was perfectly clear. On his NCOER, under leadership, I wrote ""the only reason anyone follows this man is to see what he will fuck up next.""\n   * I got bitched at by an Air Force E6 for using profanity when talking to other Army E4‚Äôs (combat wounded guys in the hospital with me) told we weren‚Äôt professionals talking like that‚Ä¶AND THEY (USAF) WERE AUTHORIZED TO WEAR CROCS IN PTS BECAUSE IT WAS HOT\n   * \\[Editor\'s Note: I\'m not going to put them in here because they\'re COALITION and not JOINT you numbskulls, but there\'s several funny short stories about working with other nations if\'n you wanted to go diggin\'.\\]\n* The Bad\n   * It wasn\'t a group but I did my Corporal\'s Course at Henderson Hall in DC. My unit was actually on Fort Meade, MD but this was the nearest we could get for the course. They put us up in army barracks. It was so bad, rats ate through our cammies. We had to hang all our shit from the ceiling otherwise they would chew through it. I lost 3 pairs of pants and a blouse that they had eaten through...\n   * I was an Air Force Academy cadet on exchange to the Naval Academy. I can definitely say that my school (Air Force) is a college where we put on uniforms and pretend to be in the military. Navy was a real military academy. There were pros and cons to both. Navy had way better esprit de corps, but Air Force had infinitely more common sense with what seemed like very obvious shit. Case in point. If it\'s late hours at the Naval Academy and you require medical attention for anything (including emergencies), you are supposed to call the duty officer, have him or her coordinate a ride to the hospital an hour away, have them inform your chain of command, and only then can you actually go to the hospital. If anyone in that chain doesn\'t pick up their phone... well.. hope the problem isn\'t \\*too\\* urgent. The Air Force by contrast, the sequence is; wake up anyone with a car, get to the hospital, and \\*then\\* figure out who you need to contact for accountability.\n* The Ugly\n   * There I was in a Joint Command. Of all branches, Army is the only one that does not have a functioning SHARP or EO Program. Someone comes on the net on the watch floor that wanted to file a Sexual Harassment complaint. I had been trying for 6 months to get audience with the CDR with Stars on his chest to let him know about this deficiency, to no avail (because the lack of EO Program meant we didn‚Äôt have an Open Door Policy either, as noted by the Element CSM at the time who is now thankfully retired). It was embarrassing that no one in the Army Element anywhere could tell this SM, or the CMSgt in the AF, where our Soldiers could file a complaint to receive help. We‚Äôre doing better on the SHARP Program over a year later, but we still haven‚Äôt had any presence from an EOA in the Command\n   * \\[Editor\'s Note: I won\'t put any one particular in here to not belabor the point, but damn there are quite a few stories about the Navy\'s E-O divide, competency, and fitness.\\]\n\n# King / Queen for a Day Hits\n\n* \\[These were givens, honestly\\]\n   * B E A R D S\n   * Actually releasing for the day when the work is done\n   * BETTER PAY HOLY SHIT PLEASE PASS THE 30% JR ENLISTED PAY\n   * Homesteading\n* If a command doesnt immediately start an investigation into a report of sexual harassment, sexual assault or regular assault the senior person with knowledge of the allegation is relieved for cause.\n* Step Promotion is decided by trial by combat.\n* Boot bands not being required for some friendly bonding.\n* \\[Honorable Mention\\] Space Force Chief Master Sergeants are now referred to as ‚ÄúMaster Chiefs‚Äù (Same response I gave in the 2020 census because this is, in fact, the hill I‚Äôm willing to die on)\n* \\[Dishonorable Mention\\] Everyone has to watch a season of anime every quarter.\n\n# Branch Retention\n\n* Air Force: 75.96% (Next highest: 7.93% I\'d go back in time to punch myself in the face)\n* Army: 29.33% (Next highest: 26.67% Air Force)\n* Coast Guard: 75.32% (Next highest: 12.99% I\'d go back in time to punch myself in the face)\n* Marine Corps: 58.33% (Next highest: 20.00% Air Force)\n* Navy: 38.30% (Next highest: 26.60% Air Force)\n* Space Force: 61.90% (Next highest: 19.05% Air Force)\n\nSo... if you didn\'t re-pick your same branch, you\'re likely to cross into the AF. Except if you\'re already AF or a Coastie, in which case you already know the truth, haha. Also, the Puddle Pirates are only willing to go into the CG, AF, or SF in that order. Zero were willing to cross into the blue, green, or red. When it comes to the Marines, they only branch they refuse to fuck with is the SF. The Navy refuses to join the Marines. And finally, the SF refuses to join the Army or Marines.

While &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the results are viewable with the first link, questions that have user input instead of pre-defined answers are typically displayed very poorly in this view. Also, there&amp;#39;s no ability to filter any of the results to begin to compare branches or to analyze trends. That&amp;#39;s where this &lt;a href=""https://media0.giphy.com/media/A9KfKenpqNDfa/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e476jgwq0kipfh55xiwgtelrf3zfbytrdo1gktp7psh&amp;amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;amp;ct=g""&gt;fucking nerd&lt;/a&gt; comes in! The second link has some of my data breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When filtered by branch, a lot of the questions had trends that matched the overall answers. I didn&amp;#39;t spend time making separate graphs for those because it looks the same as all the answers combined. The branches match, the only difference is how many in each branch answered the question. Booooooooring. Without further ado, the results!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JxkwKNacCGXIs1Ys-1ppZGl75XFWDh4nsyYGlSbgBbs/viewanalytics""&gt;Military Subreddit Census 2023 Results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Welcome back from your research. Here&amp;#39;s the deal, I fully realize that this little &lt;del&gt;fetish&lt;/del&gt; census is flawed in several fashions. Here&amp;#39;s my shit list of all the ways I fucked this year&amp;#39;s census up. If any of you have suggestions for next year that I haven&amp;#39;t already discussed, hit up my inbox. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I only noticed that I didn&amp;#39;t include a question asking which branch you&amp;#39;re a part of after 13 people already submitted answers. Fixed it live from my phone, but still.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My dumbass listed warrant ranks as CW-02 instead of CWO-2.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I busted my own deadlines! Sinceriously sorry about that. I vastly overestimated my bandwidth and writing this up repeatedly fell to the bottom of the to do list.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, now that I&amp;#39;ve taken some time to look a bit deeper than face value at all this data here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Basic Facts&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Y&amp;#39;all made 1,123 submissions. The ratio of branch submissions shaped how most questions were answered. In most charts, the disparity of answers per branch matched the disparity below. I only bothered making my own charts if I saw a trend that broke from this mold.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Air Force: 462&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Army: 258&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coast Guard: 85&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Marine Corps: 69 &lt;sup&gt;nice&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Navy: 107&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Space Force: 70 &lt;sup&gt;tried too hard for nice&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Blank: 72&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t make a chart for the question regarding your unit encouraging attending sick call or medical appointments, but I did notice something unique. The Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, and Space Force all increased in submissions as the likelihood of encouraging attendance increased from 1 to 5. The Navy was about even across 1 to 3, but did have more submissions for 4 and 5 proportional to the other services. Then, the Marine Corps were roughly equal in submissions across all 5! They really are a cult. Look, real talk for a moment. Don&amp;#39;t sacrifice your body for your service if you&amp;#39;re supporting peace time ops. And if you do, don&amp;#39;t chaff getting rated with the VA as if you didn&amp;#39;t earn it. Y&amp;#39;all take care of yourselves!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Also, there were a few questions that I thought were easy pickings for branch comparisons even if the Google Forms results don&amp;#39;t show it that way. I&amp;#39;ve made a little imgur gallery for six of them that y&amp;#39;all can check out &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/xgKqDEd""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Probably fun for the number nerds out there but I&amp;#39;m not sure who else gets down like that, so...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Generals&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Three of you claim to be generals in our midst! One is plausible... but the other &amp;quot;two&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m not so sure about. While all three ages match (50+), two of y&amp;#39;all are AH-64 Apaches serving as &amp;quot;Class IX&amp;quot; employees in the Army, commissioning with a degree in cunnilingus, would rather fight 3x other generals than other ranks, use condoms 24/7 as COVID preventative measures, claimed spanking as their highest form of punishment (though I have a feeling it wasn&amp;#39;t punishment for the receiver since their favorite form of supervisors correcting troops without paperwork is using ball gags), and would implement Titty Tuesday if they were [AH-64 Apache] For a Day. You know, just your based pervert, basically.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On second thought I think the plausible one is probably &lt;a href=""/u/SilentD""&gt;u/SilentD&lt;/a&gt; testing the submission form... so no Generals this time around. Don&amp;#39;t worry, you can be my Lieutenant General anytime, boo! o7&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Also, there&amp;#39;s something to be said about our willingness to pose anonymously as any of the General ranks... but not a single soul nutted up to be a CWO-5. Y&amp;#39;all know you&amp;#39;d get force choked even thinking about it, haha.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Levels of Punishment&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You know, I think the one who listed &amp;#39;marriage&amp;#39; and another who listed &amp;#39;heavy spanking at home&amp;#39; should probably get together.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;More than a couple of you got &amp;#39;your balls smoked off&amp;#39; or some variation like &amp;#39;Just had my ass smoked. Made 20-year old me sit down and take a breather like a 45 year old at their first BJJ practice,&amp;#39; lol. I appreciates handling the situation old fashioned and off the books.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There was a fair amount of extra duty and paperwork for juniors and seniors being on an episode of When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong. Good reads if y&amp;#39;all wanted to grab some shovels.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Marine Corps had the lowest &amp;#39;None&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Verbal&amp;#39; responses among the branches, but the highest &amp;#39;Extra Duty&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Administrative Paperwork&amp;#39;, with the second highest &amp;#39;Article 15&amp;#39;. Conversely, the Space Force had the highest &amp;#39;None&amp;#39;. I think we all saw those coming a mile away, lol.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;THERE I WAS...&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I handle the THERE I WAS question Clint Eastwood style through the categories of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. The Good are tales that are lighthearted, funny, or of benefit to the storyteller. The Bad are tales of fucking up somewhere in the chain and leaves a downer taste in your mouth. The Ugly are tales that give me a bit of a cringe as I read them. These responses are cherry picked exactly as submitted; no edits have been made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Good\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When I first check on my ship they put us in an overflow berthing where marines were supposed to stay. They‚Äôre was HUGE dent in one of the bigger stand up lockers. After about a month someone had the video of happened, several marines used a singular marine as a battering ram and slammed his in the locker several times without a helmet. The also broke all of washer and dryers on board in a similar way with the writing of ‚Äúbroken courtesy of the USMC&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Baghdad 2007, walk in fresh off the plane, Army Col looks up, sees me, says &amp;quot;come with me.&amp;quot; Go into a section, he yells for the SFC, who comes running. He tells the SFC, &amp;quot;This is SSgt XXX, he is your new section chief. Understood!?&amp;quot; SFC replies yes. I didnt get it then, but within two weeks, it was perfectly clear. On his NCOER, under leadership, I wrote &amp;quot;the only reason anyone follows this man is to see what he will fuck up next.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I got bitched at by an Air Force E6 for using profanity when talking to other Army E4‚Äôs (combat wounded guys in the hospital with me) told we weren‚Äôt professionals talking like that‚Ä¶AND THEY (USAF) WERE AUTHORIZED TO WEAR CROCS IN PTS BECAUSE IT WAS HOT&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[Editor&amp;#39;s Note: I&amp;#39;m not going to put them in here because they&amp;#39;re COALITION and not JOINT you numbskulls, but there&amp;#39;s several funny short stories about working with other nations if&amp;#39;n you wanted to go diggin&amp;#39;.]&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Bad\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t a group but I did my Corporal&amp;#39;s Course at Henderson Hall in DC. My unit was actually on Fort Meade, MD but this was the nearest we could get for the course. They put us up in army barracks. It was so bad, rats ate through our cammies. We had to hang all our shit from the ceiling otherwise they would chew through it. I lost 3 pairs of pants and a blouse that they had eaten through...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I was an Air Force Academy cadet on exchange to the Naval Academy. I can definitely say that my school (Air Force) is a college where we put on uniforms and pretend to be in the military. Navy was a real military academy. There were pros and cons to both. Navy had way better esprit de corps, but Air Force had infinitely more common sense with what seemed like very obvious shit. Case in point. If it&amp;#39;s late hours at the Naval Academy and you require medical attention for anything (including emergencies), you are supposed to call the duty officer, have him or her coordinate a ride to the hospital an hour away, have them inform your chain of command, and only then can you actually go to the hospital. If anyone in that chain doesn&amp;#39;t pick up their phone... well.. hope the problem isn&amp;#39;t *too* urgent. The Air Force by contrast, the sequence is; wake up anyone with a car, get to the hospital, and *then* figure out who you need to contact for accountability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Ugly\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There I was in a Joint Command. Of all branches, Army is the only one that does not have a functioning SHARP or EO Program. Someone comes on the net on the watch floor that wanted to file a Sexual Harassment complaint. I had been trying for 6 months to get audience with the CDR with Stars on his chest to let him know about this deficiency, to no avail (because the lack of EO Program meant we didn‚Äôt have an Open Door Policy either, as noted by the Element CSM at the time who is now thankfully retired). It was embarrassing that no one in the Army Element anywhere could tell this SM, or the CMSgt in the AF, where our Soldiers could file a complaint to receive help. We‚Äôre doing better on the SHARP Program over a year later, but we still haven‚Äôt had any presence from an EOA in the Command&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[Editor&amp;#39;s Note: I won&amp;#39;t put any one particular in here to not belabor the point, but damn there are quite a few stories about the Navy&amp;#39;s E-O divide, competency, and fitness.]&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;King / Queen for a Day Hits&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[These were givens, honestly]\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;B E A R D S&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Actually releasing for the day when the work is done&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;BETTER PAY HOLY SHIT PLEASE PASS THE 30% JR ENLISTED PAY&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Homesteading&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If a command doesnt immediately start an investigation into a report of sexual harassment, sexual assault or regular assault the senior person with knowledge of the allegation is relieved for cause.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Step Promotion is decided by trial by combat.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Boot bands not being required for some friendly bonding.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[Honorable Mention] Space Force Chief Master Sergeants are now referred to as ‚ÄúMaster Chiefs‚Äù (Same response I gave in the 2020 census because this is, in fact, the hill I‚Äôm willing to die on)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[Dishonorable Mention] Everyone has to watch a season of anime every quarter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Branch Retention&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Air Force: 75.96% (Next highest: 7.93% I&amp;#39;d go back in time to punch myself in the face)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Army: 29.33% (Next highest: 26.67% Air Force)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coast Guard: 75.32% (Next highest: 12.99% I&amp;#39;d go back in time to punch myself in the face)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Marine Corps: 58.33% (Next highest: 20.00% Air Force)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Navy: 38.30% (Next highest: 26.60% Air Force)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Space Force: 61.90% (Next highest: 19.05% Air Force)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So... if you didn&amp;#39;t re-pick your same branch, you&amp;#39;re likely to cross into the AF. Except if you&amp;#39;re already AF or a Coastie, in which case you already know the truth, haha. Also, the Puddle Pirates are only willing to go into the CG, AF, or SF in that order.

,Army,"So I have what looks like a down filled, late 40s ,mummy sleeping bag. It smells ""old"" and I was wondering about ways to clean it that wont potentially destroy it. I also will need to repair a small hole on the inside of the bag.

,Army,"I acquired a soldier in 2013 fresh out of reclassing. I gave her an initial counseling the day she came to me. 

A month later, I gave her a monthly counseling and stated because she was not technically proficient, I wasn‚Äôt recommending her for that month‚Äôs promotion board. You‚Äôd have thought I told her she‚Äôd never go to the board. 

She waited 3 months for me to go on TDY to Polk for 30 days. She then went to the post CSM and told him she‚Äôd never been counseled. She had 4 counseling statements she signed in her packet. The post CSM called my brigade and demanded my counseling packet for her. I came back from Polk and my other troops rushed to me to tattle on her. 

I went to my BN CSM and told him what was up. He asked to see her packet. I gave it to him, he told the platoon sergeant to counsel her for lying on an NCO. The only counseling she was missing was my TDY, which I couldn‚Äôt counsel her because I didn‚Äôt witness her. He told me to add a memo to her packet I was TDY and have my NCOIC give her a monthly. 

She then decided an EO complaint would be the route to go. I was standing in PT formation when one of my Joes said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking of going natural.‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôd look great!‚Äù 

I go to 0900 work call. EO walks up to me telling me she got a funny report about me. Then she asked if I told PFC X she‚Äôd look good with natural hair. I admitted I did. She said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the report. I‚Äôm not going to do anything with it.‚Äù And walked away. 

She was the worst soldier I‚Äôve ever encountered. Rather than prove to me she could do her job at the rate of an NCO, she proved she was petty and childish and deserved to wear that sham shield. I certainly wasn‚Äôt promoting her ahead of my super star soldiers who excelled at their job while she didn‚Äôt even know how to fill out basic forms.

Question for you fine Soldiers of r/army is if this job would be worth it? Reached out to my branch manager and he said go for it but go immediately into BN S6 after 12 months in the job. 

Anyone with experience as an ADC or adjutant provide expectation management for me?

,Army,"I just purchased this jacket in honor of the closest thing I ever had to a father. He was army special forces airborne and my little sisters biological father. He would often take me on the weekend at 4:00 a.m. to ""Jump Zone"" as he called it here in the deserts of Arizona. Growing up without a father and having him in my life we're the best moments of my childhood. He taught me how to fight, how to shoot, He even taught me how to sword fight in both Kendo and Fencing styles. His name was Michael Barber, and unfortunately he passed away during a parachuting accident. He was doing a stunt for the Bruce Willis movie ""Tears of the Sun"".
He was hit by a gust of wind and got wrapped in his chute and fell into the ocean. I just hope with his expertise he understood his situation and was able to find peace on his way down. The only way I can comfort myself about the situation is knowing he went out doing what he loved most....And hoping it was somehow peaceful and quick üòû

Anyway I don't know much about his rank, or even his time served. But as soon as I saw this jacket I knew I had to buy it. I've been thinking A LOT about him as I recently just got back into firearms training and he was the one who first taught me how to shoot. So I remember everything I can about his lessons and it's actually been quite helpful even all these years later. I know that he trained troops for Saudi Arabia, or trained troops in Saudi Arabia... I'm not sure if they were actual Saudi troops or not. I remember him telling me he actually spent a lot of time and Saudi civilian clothing because he could pass as Saudi Arabian. I think he also worked with the Mujahideen because he would talk a lot about them and he showed me how to sneak around in the mountains like they did. Sorry I've gotten WAAAY of topic. 

To anyone still reading thank you very much for allowing me to reminisce. 

If anyone has any information on this style of camouflage I would greatly appreciate it. Sorry for the long tangent. And Thanks again for anyone who has read this and is willing to help.

When filtered by branch, a lot of the questions had trends that matched the overall answers.

[Military Subreddit Census 2023 Results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JxkwKNacCGXIs1Ys-1ppZGl75XFWDh4nsyYGlSbgBbs/viewanalytics)

Welcome back from your research. Here's the deal, I fully realize that this little ~~fetish~~ census is flawed in several fashions. Here's my shit list of all the ways I fucked this year's census up. If any of you have suggestions for next year that I haven't already discussed, hit up my inbox. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

* I only noticed that I didn't include a question asking which branch you're a part of after 13 people already submitted answers. Fixed it live from my phone, but still.
* My dumbass listed warrant ranks as CW-02 instead of CWO-2.
* I busted my own deadlines! Sinceriously sorry about that. I vastly overestimated my bandwidth and writing this up repeatedly fell to the bottom of the to do list.

Anyways, now that I've taken some time to look a bit deeper than face value at all this data here's what I've found.

# Basic Facts

* Y'all made 1,123 submissions. The ratio of branch submissions shaped how most questions were answered. In most charts, the disparity of answers per branch matched the disparity below. I only bothered making my own charts if I saw a trend that broke from this mold.
   * Air Force: 462
   * Army: 258
   * Coast Guard: 85
   * Marine Corps: 69 ^(nice)
   * Navy: 107
   * Space Force: 70 ^(tried too hard for nice)
   * Blank: 72
* I didn't make a chart for the question regarding your unit encouraging attending sick call or medical appointments, but I did notice something unique. The Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, and Space Force all increased in submissions as the likelihood of encouraging attendance increased from 1 to 5. The Navy was about even across 1 to 3, but did have more submissions for 4 and 5 proportional to the other services. Then, the Marine Corps were roughly equal in submissions across all 5! They really are a cult. Look, real talk for a moment. Don't sacrifice your body for your service if you're supporting peace time ops. And if you do, don't chaff getting rated with the VA as if you didn't earn it. Y'all take care of yourselves!
* Also, there were a few questions that I thought were easy pickings for branch comparisons even if the Google Forms results don't show it that way. I've made a little imgur gallery for six of them that y'all can check out [here](https://imgur.com/a/xgKqDEd). Probably fun for the number nerds out there but I'm not sure who else gets down like that, so...

# Generals

* Three of you claim to be generals in our midst! One is plausible... but the other ""two"" I'm not so sure about. While all three ages match (50+), two of y'all are AH-64 Apaches serving as ""Class IX"" employees in the Army, commissioning with a degree in cunnilingus, would rather fight 3x other generals than other ranks, use condoms 24/7 as COVID preventative measures, claimed spanking as their highest form of punishment (though I have a feeling it wasn't punishment for the receiver since their favorite form of supervisors correcting troops without paperwork is using ball gags), and would implement Titty Tuesday if they were \[AH-64 Apache\] For a Day. You know, just your based pervert, basically.
* On second thought I think the plausible one is probably u/SilentD testing the submission form... so no Generals this time around. Don't worry, you can be my Lieutenant General anytime, boo! o7
* Also, there's something to be said about our willingness to pose anonymously as any of the General ranks... but not a single soul nutted up to be a CWO-5. Y'all know you'd get force choked even thinking about it, haha.

# Levels of Punishment

* You know, I think the one who listed 'marriage' and another who listed 'heavy spanking at home' should probably get together.
* More than a couple of you got 'your balls smoked off' or some variation like 'Just had my ass smoked. Made 20-year old me sit down and take a breather like a 45 year old at their first BJJ practice,' lol. I appreciates handling the situation old fashioned and off the books.
* There was a fair amount of extra duty and paperwork for juniors and seniors being on an episode of When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong. Good reads if y'all wanted to grab some shovels.
* The Marine Corps had the lowest 'None' and 'Verbal' responses among the branches, but the highest 'Extra Duty' and 'Administrative Paperwork', with the second highest 'Article 15'. Conversely, the Space Force had the highest 'None'. I think we all saw those coming a mile away, lol.

# THERE I WAS...

I handle the THERE I WAS question Clint Eastwood style through the categories of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. The Good are tales that are lighthearted, funny, or of benefit to the storyteller. The Bad are tales of fucking up somewhere in the chain and leaves a downer taste in your mouth. The Ugly are tales that give me a bit of a cringe as I read them. These responses are cherry picked exactly as submitted; no edits have been made.

* The Good
   * When I first check on my ship they put us in an overflow berthing where marines were supposed to stay. They‚Äôre was HUGE dent in one of the bigger stand up lockers. After about a month someone had the video of happened, several marines used a singular marine as a battering ram and slammed his in the locker several times without a helmet. The also broke all of washer and dryers on board in a similar way with the writing of ‚Äúbroken courtesy of the USMC""
   * Baghdad 2007, walk in fresh off the plane, Army Col looks up, sees me, says ""come with me."" Go into a section, he yells for the SFC, who comes running. He tells the SFC, ""This is SSgt XXX, he is your new section chief. Understood!?"" SFC replies yes. I didnt get it then, but within two weeks, it was perfectly clear. On his NCOER, under leadership, I wrote ""the only reason anyone follows this man is to see what he will fuck up next.""
   * I got bitched at by an Air Force E6 for using profanity when talking to other Army E4‚Äôs (combat wounded guys in the hospital with me) told we weren‚Äôt professionals talking like that‚Ä¶AND THEY (USAF) WERE AUTHORIZED TO WEAR CROCS IN PTS BECAUSE IT WAS HOT
   * \[Editor's Note: I'm not going to put them in here because they're COALITION and not JOINT you numbskulls, but there's several funny short stories about working with other nations if'n you wanted to go diggin'.\]
* The Bad
   * It wasn't a group but I did my Corporal's Course at Henderson Hall in DC. My unit was actually on Fort Meade, MD but this was the nearest we could get for the course. They put us up in army barracks. It was so bad, rats ate through our cammies. We had to hang all our shit from the ceiling otherwise they would chew through it. I lost 3 pairs of pants and a blouse that they had eaten through...
   * I was an Air Force Academy cadet on exchange to the Naval Academy. I can definitely say that my school (Air Force) is a college where we put on uniforms and pretend to be in the military. Navy was a real military academy. There were pros and cons to both. Navy had way better esprit de corps, but Air Force had infinitely more common sense with what seemed like very obvious shit. Case in point. If it's late hours at the Naval Academy and you require medical attention for anything (including emergencies), you are supposed to call the duty officer, have him or her coordinate a ride to the hospital an hour away, have them inform your chain of command, and only then can you actually go to the hospital. If anyone in that chain doesn't pick up their phone... well.. hope the problem isn't \*too\* urgent. The Air Force by contrast, the sequence is; wake up anyone with a car, get to the hospital, and \*then\* figure out who you need to contact for accountability.
* The Ugly
   * There I was in a Joint Command. Of all branches, Army is the only one that does not have a functioning SHARP or EO Program. Someone comes on the net on the watch floor that wanted to file a Sexual Harassment complaint. I had been trying for 6 months to get audience with the CDR with Stars on his chest to let him know about this deficiency, to no avail (because the lack of EO Program meant we didn‚Äôt have an Open Door Policy either, as noted by the Element CSM at the time who is now thankfully retired). It was embarrassing that no one in the Army Element anywhere could tell this SM, or the CMSgt in the AF, where our Soldiers could file a complaint to receive help. We‚Äôre doing better on the SHARP Program over a year later, but we still haven‚Äôt had any presence from an EOA in the Command
   * \[Editor's Note: I won't put any one particular in here to not belabor the point, but damn there are quite a few stories about the Navy's E-O divide, competency, and fitness.\]

# King / Queen for a Day Hits

* \[These were givens, honestly\]
   * B E A R D S
   * Actually releasing for the day when the work is done
   * BETTER PAY HOLY SHIT PLEASE PASS THE 30% JR ENLISTED PAY
   * Homesteading
* If a command doesnt immediately start an investigation into a report of sexual harassment, sexual assault or regular assault the senior person with knowledge of the allegation is relieved for cause.
* Step Promotion is decided by trial by combat.
* Boot bands not being required for some friendly bonding.
* \[Honorable Mention\] Space Force Chief Master Sergeants are now referred to as ‚ÄúMaster Chiefs‚Äù (Same response I gave in the 2020 census because this is, in fact, the hill I‚Äôm willing to die on)
* \[Dishonorable Mention\] Everyone has to watch a season of anime every quarter.

# Branch Retention

* Air Force: 75.96% (Next highest: 7.93% I'd go back in time to punch myself in the face)
* Army: 29.33% (Next highest: 26.67% Air Force)
* Coast Guard: 75.32% (Next highest: 12.99% I'd go back in time to punch myself in the face)
* Marine Corps: 58.33% (Next highest: 20.00% Air Force)
* Navy: 38.30% (Next highest: 26.60% Air Force)
* Space Force: 61.90% (Next highest: 19.05% Air Force)

So... if you didn't re-pick your same branch, you're likely to cross into the AF. Except if you're already AF or a Coastie, in which case you already know the truth, haha. Also, the Puddle Pirates are only willing to go into the CG, AF, or SF in that order. Zero were willing to cross into the blue, green, or red. When it comes to the Marines, they only branch they refuse to fuck with is the SF. The Navy refuses to join the Marines. And finally, the SF refuses to join the Army or Marines. Makes total sense, but I get a kick out of seeing the instinct we all have validated here.

Now, unless any of you have other questions or things you'd like to see from the data set I'm going to look away and try to get my eyes to stop bleeding.",t2_bdev9,False,,0,False,Military Subreddit Census 2023 Results,[],r/USMC,False,7.0,purple,0,,,False,t3_18u8lxz,False,dark,0.92,,public,10,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,10,,False,False,self,1703947442.0,,[],{},,True,,1703916222.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.USMC,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, ladies and gents, the results are in! While &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the results are viewable with the first link, questions that have user input instead of pre-defined answers are typically displayed very poorly in this view. Also, there&amp;#39;s no ability to filter any of the results to begin to compare branches or to analyze trends. That&amp;#39;s where this &lt;a href=""https://media0.giphy.com/media/A9KfKenpqNDfa/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e476jgwq0kipfh55xiwgtelrf3zfbytrdo1gktp7psh&amp;amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;amp;ct=g""&gt;fucking nerd&lt;/a&gt; comes in! The second link has some of my data breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When filtered by branch, a lot of the questions had trends that matched the overall answers. I didn&amp;#39;t spend time making separate graphs for those because it looks the same as all the answers combined. The branches match, the only difference is how many in each branch answered the question. Booooooooring. Without further ado, the results!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;There I was in a Joint Command. Of all branches, Army is the only one that does not have a functioning SHARP or EO Program.

I had been trying for 6 months to get audience with the CDR with Stars on his chest to let him know about this deficiency, to no avail (because the lack of EO Program meant we didn‚Äôt have an Open Door Policy either, as noted by the Element CSM at the time who is now thankfully retired).

&lt;h1&gt;Branch Retention&lt;/h1&gt;

# Ego: ""I ain't hurtin' no one, so what's it matter?""

When the Marine starts to think the rules aren't beneficial, what others will be broken?

If you're showing your command and peers a lack of self-care, and self-discipline, then what are you gonna try to get away with when NO ONE is looking, hm? That's the worrisome part! That's why everyone's on your butt, man. Do ya get it?  This is a ""red flag"".

If you're lax on trimming on your own damn bushes then how lax are you gonna be clearing out those bushes obstructing your field of fire. If I was your TL, I'd be constantly concerned about you.

# Pride: ""I'm putting out more than them, I deserve a break""

When the Marine starts to think that he's too entitled to tuck his shirt in while he's working because it's hot and he's working on something big and important for the team. Maybe he just got back from a long 7 day mission and he just wants to sit in the chow hall with his gym shirt on. That tells me that you're not always gonna put out 100%. You know there's a time and place for a break, for a gym shirt, for R\&amp;R; but breaking protocols in front of a unit that's bonded on the structure and discipline and uniformity of it's men is not the time and or place. 

Remember the head shaving process, the issuance of the same uniforms for everyone? What about when 1 marine screwed up, do you remember your entire team getting punished along with you? You all lost that right to be a one man band when you joined the Corps! Now you're part of a corps, THE CORPS.

You've heard it said before, but do you really know what esprit de corps means?

It's the feeling of comradery, fellowship, unity and pride all felt by the same group.

But when the Marine starts to not follow the rules like everyone else, they start to etch away at that comradery. A cancer that eats it's own body must be stopped before it spreads

,USMC,"BLUF:  need feedback on whether y‚Äôall see value in taking everything that works from Reddit‚Äôs military subreddits and merging it into a Rally Point-style service that isn‚Äôt toxic and actually works.

Hi all, I had originally posted this to r/army, but the subreddit‚Äôs rule 3 won‚Äôt allow it through. To be clear, this is not an ad for a service, but rather a post to gauge interest in a project I‚Äôve been working on with some friends. Any and all feedback on our idea would be greatly appreciated! 

This idea sparked after observing the mixed feelings within the online military community regarding the Rally Point website. 

To quote a post by u/BrokenRatingScheme:

""It's full of sycophant active duty members and surly, self-important retirees that firmly believe, with the entirety of their being, that their often incorrect opinion is the only one that matters, and the opinion of anyone not in their MOS/below their (retired) rank is worthy of scorn and mob-mentality chastisement.

It's like LinkedIn where everyone senior to you can be as rude and self-fellating as they want, because what are you going to say? You're one GAL lookup away from someone contacting your leadership and letting them know you were perceived as disrespectful. It's an echo chamber social network.""

This, combined with the positive dynamics of r/army, inspired us to create a platform that merges the best of both worlds: the community spirit of the military subreddits with the service member-focused intent of Rally Point.

Our aim is to emulate the app Blind's format, while offering an anonymous and supportive environment. Here‚Äôs our current take on the pros and cons of both platforms:

Rally Point:Pros:
* Specifically built for service members.
* [Your input on other positives would be greatly appreciated.]
Cons:
* Toxic culture dominated by rank.
* No anonymity.
* Lacks a supportive environment.
* User interface challenges.
* Overly serious, lacking in community engagement.

Reddit military subreddits:Pros:
* Balances serious discussion and casual interaction.
* Strong, helpful community.
* Anonymity respected.
* no rank games and big-dickmanship
* Effective moderation.

Cons:
* Navigational challenges.
* Valuable discussions can get lost.
* Dependent on Reddit's guidelines.
* no internal navigation to pages or sub-groups for specific needs (like subpages for mentoring/mental health assistance/shitposts/unit specific/MOS specific/post ETS job search etc...)

This list is by no means all-inclusive and I'd welcome any and all input on it.Is this something that you would use/benefit from? And If you all think this is an asinine idea I'd be happy to hear that too, as my ultimate goal is to create a service that people actually want, and feel they could benefit from.

I‚Äôll take a double chicken chalupa with a Coke and  side of Gabagool

TLDR: building an app, is it something you‚Äôd be interested in?

And If you all think this is an asinine idea I&amp;#39;d be happy to hear that too, as my ultimate goal is to create a service that people actually want, and feel they could benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;

""Dear user,

As you may know, your elected officials in North Carolina are requiring us to verify your age before allowing you access to our website. While safety and compliance are at the forefront of our mission, giving your ID card every time you want to visit an adult platform is not the most effective solution for protecting our users, and in fact, will put children and your privacy at risk.

In addition, mandating age verification without proper enforcement gives platforms the opportunity to choose whether or not to comply. As we‚Äôve seen in other states, this just drives traffic to sites with far fewer safety measures in place. Very few sites are able to compare to the robust Trust and Safety measures we currently have in place. To protect children and user privacy, any legislation must be enforced against all platforms offering adult content.

The safety of our users is one of our biggest concerns. We believe that the best and most effective solution for protecting children and adults alike is to identify users by their device and allow access to age-restricted materials and websites based on that identification. Until a real solution is offered, we have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in North Carolina.

i (19 F) am not diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but have recently have had several incidents where i was experiencing what i can only assume is a manic episode. i have severe memory loss of these episodes and even the days and weeks surrounding them. i had one that lasted for i think 6 days and ended up with me in the hospital having to be sedated because i hadn‚Äôt slept in 6 days and would not calm down. the most recent one lasted about 4-5 days and subsided naturally on its own. 

i am currently diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Oppositional Defiance Disorder. i‚Äôve had these diagnoses for years.

i also in my research found that i have been exhibiting some of the physical symptoms of bipolar as well. for starters, i wet the bed as a child until i was about 12 or 13 and had to wear pull ups every night, i have a facial tic that i‚Äôve had since elementary school, i‚Äôve struggled with both insomnia and hypersomnia my whole life, with the hypersomnia being the most severe in high school. something that really stuck out to me is the exaggerated startle response. i could never figure out why i‚Äôm so ‚Äújumpy‚Äù and usually yell or scream if someone talks suddenly or makes a sudden movement or noise. as well as those things i also grind my teeth, especially during these episodes. 

now here is what i am confused about; in my research, it says that in order to be diagnosed with bipolar 1, you have to have had a manic episode lasting for at least 7 days or more. for bipolar 2 its 2 weeks. none of my episodes have lasted longer than 6 days. in my opinion, my episodes are too severe to be hypomania like some of you might suggest. i can provide more details about my episodes if needed.  

so does anyone have any ideas about what is going on? i plan on seeing a psychiatrist of course but i want to hear some insight from people who have first hand experience. let me know what you think. feel free to ask any questions you have about my episodes or anything else. any and all opinions are welcomed and appreciated. thanks!",t2_e9wj849w,False,,0,False,"i suspect i‚Äôm bipolar, but i have some questions","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,False,,,0,,,True,t3_18v04y2,False,light,0.33,,public,0,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Support/Advice :shy:,False,0,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1703999620.0,richtext,,,,text,self.bipolar,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;before i begin i would just like to clarify that i am not looking for a diagnosis here, i am asking if it is possible to be manic (not hypomanic) for less than 7 days. please read all the information i have given for the best understanding of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"Hello everyone, 26(m), I am writing this post to seek support because yesterday I left my psychiatry appointment 15 minutes earlier than scheduled following a heated discussion about my concern with one of the notes she made on myChart.

For some context I was hospitalized for mania and diagnosed with bipolar/psychotic features in October 2021 due to the hallucinations and delusions I was experiencing at the time. I got released from the hospital while still manic and without any medication and my situation only got worse. I got in a fight in January 2022 while in psychoses(thankfully nobody was seriously hurt) and was arrested as a result. It was an extremely traumatizing event but thankfully as far as legal charges go I was found not guilty by reason of insanity in May of 2023.

I started treatment with my current psychiatrist/provider in February of 2022 because getting treatment was one of the conditions of my release from jail that was ordered by the court. I complied and quickly enrolled in treatment despite still being manic and paranoid in general. At the start of my treatment, my psychiatrist was immensely helpful. She put me on abilify which worked wonders and in just about 1 short month I was no longer experiencing any major manic symptoms. However, and I'm sure most of you all know how the story goes next, I felt a strong sense of embarrassment and shame about my manic episode and fell into a deep depression as result.

This is where one of my key issues with my psychiatrist began. Over the course of my treatment since February 2022, I've been on 8 different medications, and am currently on a total of 5. I experienced exponential weight gain after starting some of the medications she put me on which only further plummeted by self-esteem as I use to always be a person who was in ""good shape"". I feel strongly that I have been overmedicated and there are 2 medications I am on in particular that have had some significant side effects and that didn't seem to present any net positive benefit to the table. I've been expressing my concern about being overmedicated for the entirety of this year to no avail. My concerns have fallen on deaf ears and the usual response of my psychiatrist to me bringing up these concerns is to simply INCREASE the dosages of the various medications I am on, which has only exacerbated my weight gain and intensified my feelings of depression and anxiety.

Now that brings us to my appointment with my psychiatrist yesterday. I already felt prior to this meeting that there was a great deal of dissonance between us and I never feel any connection with what she says. I have many times left my appointments more stressed than when I got there because of something she said and I've vented to my mom plenty of times about how much she stresses me out. Before going to my appointment, I had read a note on myChart that said something to the affect ""Person's sleep schedule is inconsistent at his choosing and he has no motivation to change it."" I read this thinking to myself: ""I choose to be unable to sleep at night? I choose to be depressed and have racing thoughts?"". Bothered by the note, I decided I would ask my psychiatrist at the appoint what she meant by that. However, when I attempted to do so, instead of explaining what she meant, she accused me of being a nittpicker and started to loudly assert that she wasn't going to change the note(I never asked her to change the note btw). When I tried to ask a second time what she meant by that note, she very loudly said ""This appointment is going to end. Can we have this appointment? Or this appointment is going to end."" When she said a second time that the appointment was going to end I was so frustrated I stood up and said ""alright, see ya"" and I got up and left. 

The wrenching ordeal wasn't over quite yet though because about 40 minutes later I got a call from my psychiatrist and she began to insinuate that my ""attitude and antagonistic behavior"" was probably due to the recent increase in my wellbutrin(a medication which has helped me lots btw). I told her that's impossible because I never picked up the new dosage to begin with because my insurance didn't cover it, to which she said ""Well don't pick up the new one because it could cause more 'irritable mood'"". So in other words, she tried to attribute our disagreement to one of my medications. Apparently people with bipolar aren't allowed to disagree with someone without being suspected of being off their meds or on the wrong med. I've just absolutely had enough and do not feel comfortable seeing her at all. There are other providers/psychiatrists at the place I go to but I'm so afraid to ask about changing because I'm scared they'll say no. Not sure how to handle this situation. Has anyone else requested to change to a different psychiatrist before? If so, how did the staff/organization react to your request? Any advice and tips would be greatly appreciated.

&lt;p&gt;For some context I was hospitalized for mania and diagnosed with bipolar/psychotic features in October 2021 due to the hallucinations and delusions I was experiencing at the time. I got released from the hospital while still manic and without any medication and my situation only got worse. I got in a fight in January 2022 while in psychoses(thankfully nobody was seriously hurt) and was arrested as a result. It was an extremely traumatizing event but thankfully as far as legal charges go I was found not guilty by reason of insanity in May of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started treatment with my current psychiatrist/provider in February of 2022 because getting treatment was one of the conditions of my release from jail that was ordered by the court. I complied and quickly enrolled in treatment despite still being manic and paranoid in general. At the start of my treatment, my psychiatrist was immensely helpful. She put me on abilify which worked wonders and in just about 1 short month I was no longer experiencing any major manic symptoms. However, and I&amp;#39;m sure most of you all know how the story goes next, I felt a strong sense of embarrassment and shame about my manic episode and fell into a deep depression as result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where one of my key issues with my psychiatrist began. Over the course of my treatment since February 2022, I&amp;#39;ve been on 8 different medications, and am currently on a total of 5. I experienced exponential weight gain after starting some of the medications she put me on which only further plummeted by self-esteem as I use to always be a person who was in &amp;quot;good shape&amp;quot;. I feel strongly that I have been overmedicated and there are 2 medications I am on in particular that have had some significant side effects and that didn&amp;#39;t seem to present any net positive benefit to the table. I&amp;#39;ve been expressing my concern about being overmedicated for the entirety of this year to no avail. My concerns have fallen on deaf ears and the usual response of my psychiatrist to me bringing up these concerns is to simply INCREASE the dosages of the various medications I am on, which has only exacerbated my weight gain and intensified my feelings of depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that brings us to my appointment with my psychiatrist yesterday. I already felt prior to this meeting that there was a great deal of dissonance between us and I never feel any connection with what she says. I have many times left my appointments more stressed than when I got there because of something she said and I&amp;#39;ve vented to my mom plenty of times about how much she stresses me out. Before going to my appointment, I had read a note on myChart that said something to the affect &amp;quot;Person&amp;#39;s sleep schedule is inconsistent at his choosing and he has no motivation to change it.&amp;quot; I read this thinking to myself: &amp;quot;I choose to be unable to sleep at night? I choose to be depressed and have racing thoughts?&amp;quot;. Bothered by the note, I decided I would ask my psychiatrist at the appoint what she meant by that. However, when I attempted to do so, instead of explaining what she meant, she accused me of being a nittpicker and started to loudly assert that she wasn&amp;#39;t going to change the note(I never asked her to change the note btw). When I tried to ask a second time what she meant by that note, she very loudly said &amp;quot;This appointment is going to end. Can we have this appointment? Or this appointment is going to end.&amp;quot; When she said a second time that the appointment was going to end I was so frustrated I stood up and said &amp;quot;alright, see ya&amp;quot; and I got up and left. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wrenching ordeal wasn&amp;#39;t over quite yet though because about 40 minutes later I got a call from my psychiatrist and she began to insinuate that my &amp;quot;attitude and antagonistic behavior&amp;quot; was probably due to the recent increase in my wellbutrin(a medication which has helped me lots btw). I told her that&amp;#39;s impossible because I never picked up the new dosage to begin with because my insurance didn&amp;#39;t cover it, to which she said &amp;quot;Well don&amp;#39;t pick up the new one because it could cause more &amp;#39;irritable mood&amp;#39;&amp;quot;. So in other words, she tried to attribute our disagreement to one of my medications. Apparently people with bipolar aren&amp;#39;t allowed to disagree with someone without being suspected of being off their meds or on the wrong med. I&amp;#39;ve just absolutely had enough and do not feel comfortable seeing her at all. There are other providers/psychiatrists at the place I go to but I&amp;#39;m so afraid to ask about changing because I&amp;#39;m scared they&amp;#39;ll say no. Not sure how to handle this situation. Has anyone else requested to change to a different psychiatrist before? If so, how did the staff/organization react to your request? Any advice and tips would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all and sorry for the book. I&amp;#39;m just in a very depressed mood right now and don&amp;#39;t know where to turn. I feel so overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"Homelessness at 23 years old traumatized me forever

I had a psychotic episode and went homeless for a few months during winter in Canada. One night, there was one man that saw me asleep at the atm in the bank and began talking to me. At first he was helpful and curious about my life. Then he began verbally abusing me for 30 minutes to an hour. Non stop yelling, saying I‚Äôm a meth head, crack addict, etc. and it got to the point that I started to believe him. I‚Äôm not lying, I actually began believing I was a crackhead because he pounded the idea into my brain with his yelling. Then he gave me two five dollar bills and went off. 


Every other interaction with any human was just as negative. Be it a police officer, a random customer offering to buy me food, or a security guard escorting me out .

I never felt empathy from the strangers I met. Even the ones buying me food did it out of their own desire to highlight their self image, it was so obvious. The police officers looked at me like another opportunity to trap a person into jail for as long as possible. The police would smile in my face while they say I looked like shit or that my eyes are dilated so much that I‚Äôm obviously on drugs when I wasn‚Äôt on drugs at all. 

Civilians never interacted with me. They only did so when they asked me to leave their property and they‚Äôd do it with no sense of humanity just a cold and short demand for me to get out of here. That was their words, get. out. of here.

I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 during an extremely destructive hypomanic episode in September and October. Since around late October has definitely been a low, but the past week or two have been unusual and I wanted to see if anyone has experienced something similar.

Last Monday I slept for an entire 24hrs and spent the days after that sleeping probably 20 hours a day and involuntarily ruminating for any of the time I spent awake. This Tuesday I stayed up for a full night and was energized the next day on top of noticing that the rumination had stopped. The next day, a fter another night of staying up I was wired until my body forced me asleep.

Since then, it feels like I've been contradicting myself to the point I worry I made it all up. I've been ruminating again but also have moments of energy where I make plans to do things that I later have no interest in. My energy levels are all over the place and I don't know how to even name the state I'm in.

,bipolar,"So, I recently had a hypomanic episode and I'm pretty sure it just ended, but I'm having a few really severe symptoms still. The biggest issue is severe hypersexuality, to the point where I can no longer function at work. There doesn't seem to be any trigger because I won't even be having sexual thoughts and it'll just happen. And it lasts for hours on end and becomes agony.

A major issue is I no longer can walk comfortably because of it. Any sort of walking aggravates it, which is why working and doing physical stuff is becoming so difficult. And another issue is I have terrible restlessness as well. I can't stand still for longer than five seconds most of the time and feel the need to pace nearly constantly.

So these two symptoms will aggravate each other and get so intense that it's impossible to focus and work. My mom thinks I might still be in an episode if my functioning is impaired but I'm not sure because I haven't had elation in a while. And also it's strange because hypomanic episodes have never impaired my functioning before and were usually very mild.

I should say I've got a therapist and psychiatrist appointment scheduled but I still have a week before one of them and longer for the other. But do any of you have things that might work and get rid of the unwanted arousal, or at least a way to tolerate the sensation. It's getting the point where I'll break down crying because it's so uncomfortable.

,bipolar,"It first started when I was a teen in 2004 and was having a major depressive episode for 2 years because I wasn't really happy with the new high school. I was failing in all my courses in my second year of high school due to severe cognitive decline and memory issues retaining what I studied. I had to drop out for 2 years. 

That's around the time when I went on a week long vacation with friends in summer 2005 and had a blast and my moods turned to manic those days. My brother had to come down to supervise me because of my erratic behaviour. I was misdiagnosed as having borderline personality disorder because the expensive psychiatrist I went to met me while I was severely depressed and couldn't express myself and she couldn't figure it out. 

I think that vacation saved me though because I found my first love in my manic state. She was nurturing and helped through the 4.5 years we were together. I was full of life for a while and managed to pass my high school exams somehow. I was intermittently depressed again during the first year with my new girlfriend but she was supportive and I made it all the way through college without depression. I've always been a bit excitable and people just thought of me as a little crazy in college which I now realise was because of BP. I had a good time all through college without getting manic though.

I didn't have any symptoms from when I started college in 2006. I finished college with good grades, got a good job in business research soon after college where I was a top performer and was rapidly promoted, had ambition. I went to The Netherlands to do my master's in 2014.

Christmas 2014 I was backpacking through Europe with friends and was full of joy in those days and that's what triggered my mania but I managed to get back to my university town somehow alone and in mania. I was getting progressively manic over the next month and was left unsupervised in a foreign country. I had a very severe manic episode and the police had to get me hospitalised. I was involuntarily admitted by a magistrates order for 4 months. In another country with better mental healthcare that I wouldn't have got back home, I feel I was lucky even though I had to drop out of University and didn't get a chance to complete my studies.

2015 went by with severe cognitive decline. I slept 16 hours. I couldn't read or talk much but met with few friends daily, smoked some weed and chilled for the next two years recovering. I wasn't as bright as before so I managed to get a less demanding job in a bank doing business development. Sadly I was laid off because I was underperforming and haven't held a job since 2017 because I was getting intermittent mild hypomanic mood swings.

The next 3 years were completely stable I read 50 books a year, listened to a lot of music, did many online courses for 2 years which didn't help me get a job however. But I was content because I felt normal then.

I moved states during the pandemic in 2020 and had another severe manic episode mid 2021 was hospitalised in October for over a month and again had cognitive decline and was still a bit manic but not severe for a few months after discharge. During my recovery I again began sleeping 16 hours. I meditated for 4 hours a day during my recovery which helped out a lot in giving me some peace and satisfaction.

Sadly I broke off contact with most of my friends during that time because I couldn't get myself to get in touch and not many friends got in touch with me either. I did manage to keep a handful close friends though they don't live near me. I managed to make just one new friend in the place I'm at now and go out once in a while. Ihope I find new friends, I used to be more sociable

I only felt my normal self 6 months ago but the hypersomnia continues. I feel hopeful about 2024 though and plan to read more books like before, go out to the beach during the day which I find improves my mood and be content in life.

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s around the time when I went on a week long vacation with friends in summer 2005 and had a blast and my moods turned to manic those days. My brother had to come down to supervise me because of my erratic behaviour. I was misdiagnosed as having borderline personality disorder because the expensive psychiatrist I went to met me while I was severely depressed and couldn&amp;#39;t express myself and she couldn&amp;#39;t figure it out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that vacation saved me though because I found my first love in my manic state. She was nurturing and helped through the 4.5 years we were together. I was full of life for a while and managed to pass my high school exams somehow. I was intermittently depressed again during the first year with my new girlfriend but she was supportive and I made it all the way through college without depression. I&amp;#39;ve always been a bit excitable and people just thought of me as a little crazy in college which I now realise was because of BP. I had a good time all through college without getting manic though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t have any symptoms from when I started college in 2006. I finished college with good grades, got a good job in business research soon after college where I was a top performer and was rapidly promoted, had ambition. I went to The Netherlands to do my master&amp;#39;s in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christmas 2014 I was backpacking through Europe with friends and was full of joy in those days and that&amp;#39;s what triggered my mania but I managed to get back to my university town somehow alone and in mania. I was getting progressively manic over the next month and was left unsupervised in a foreign country. I had a very severe manic episode and the police had to get me hospitalised. I was involuntarily admitted by a magistrates order for 4 months. In another country with better mental healthcare that I wouldn&amp;#39;t have got back home, I feel I was lucky even though I had to drop out of University and didn&amp;#39;t get a chance to complete my studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015 went by with severe cognitive decline. I slept 16 hours. I couldn&amp;#39;t read or talk much but met with few friends daily, smoked some weed and chilled for the next two years recovering. I wasn&amp;#39;t as bright as before so I managed to get a less demanding job in a bank doing business development. Sadly I was laid off because I was underperforming and haven&amp;#39;t held a job since 2017 because I was getting intermittent mild hypomanic mood swings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next 3 years were completely stable I read 50 books a year, listened to a lot of music, did many online courses for 2 years which didn&amp;#39;t help me get a job however. But I was content because I felt normal then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved states during the pandemic in 2020 and had another severe manic episode mid 2021 was hospitalised in October for over a month and again had cognitive decline and was still a bit manic but not severe for a few months after discharge. During my recovery I again began sleeping 16 hours. I meditated for 4 hours a day during my recovery which helped out a lot in giving me some peace and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly I broke off contact with most of my friends during that time because I couldn&amp;#39;t get myself to get in touch and not many friends got in touch with me either. I did manage to keep a handful close friends though they don&amp;#39;t live near me. I managed to make just one new friend in the place I&amp;#39;m at now and go out once in a while. Ihope I find new friends, I used to be more sociable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only felt my normal self 6 months ago but the hypersomnia continues. I feel hopeful about 2024 though and plan to read more books like before, go out to the beach during the day which I find improves my mood and be content in life. I just hope I find someone who is understanding and accepting of me when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"The struggle of being Trans and Bipolar

I don't feel like people talk enough about how dysphoria can be triggering for a Trans person with bipolar disorder.

I don't speak for everyone in this post, I'm just reporting what MY experience is like as a bipolar trans person. 

It's literally a roller coaster. When I'm in hypomania, gender euphoria is frequent, well, until it isn't anymore and I decline very quickly into depression and in a very intense way. Sometimes it's a characteristic I notice in a person of a biological gender that I know I'll never have, or when I see that clothes don't fit me the way they do on cis people. Events like being called by pronoun are also a big trigger, and this simply derails me into episodes of external depression. 

My depression is usually very quiet, I keep getting up, doing basic everyday things, but I live in total apathy. I sleep too much at the same time that I don't sleep at all and I become a really quiet person.

But the depression caused by dysphoria is too explosive and sudden, very, very unstable. The slightest slip makes me burst into anger or start crying, I start to hallucinate about my own body and I have broken at least three mirrors when I see my reflection. 

As I said, I'm just telling you my experience. But if a person without the disorder already suffers considerably from gender dysphoria, a bipolar person can have much worse reactions to It.

However, since my autism diagnosis I and my family began doubting my bipolar diagnosis as it was not diagnosed by a specialised bipolar psychiatrist, but an eating disorder psychiatrist (as I was under his care at the time due to anorexia)

Further, my experience with antipsychotic medication (for bipolar) was somewhat subpar, I experienced adverse reactions and hyper sensitivity to extremely small doses - this could however be as autistic people do react more sensitively to medication.

,bipolar,"What does a mixed episode look like for you?

For reference, I was diagnosed bipolar 1 with mixed episodes 3 years ago, so I‚Äôm still fairly new understanding when I‚Äôm in an episode, mainly mania, hypomania, and mixed. 

I think I‚Äôm in a mixed episode or possibly just hypomania.

I am F(29) bipolar II amongst other things, I just got out of the psych hospital a week ago today for treatment for my depression. 

In the hospital I began to feel much better and was so happy to feel good again after such a long time.

,bipolar,"Sorry for the long post but‚Ä¶ September 27th, 2023 the day before my moms 48th birthday is the day my life fell apart. 

I barelyyyy graduated college in December 2022 with my bachelors after failing out of pt school and my mom and stepdad were so proud of me because I was the first bachelors degree college graduate in the family. I struggled to get a job but I finally got a job at a sketchy life insurance company that I quit 6 months later because it was a terrible job that took advantage of the elderly black community.  I got another job instantly after quitting and even got a large pay increase, even though I was burnt out on the industry I kept pushing. 

On a random Tuesday morning I woke up to 50 missed calls from my family. The man who raised me had a heart attack (51 m) and was in the hospital. I rushed to the hospital at 4:30 am (1 hr away) swerving through traffic and driving way faster than I should have. Once I got to the hospital there were 20+ of our close family members in the cardiac intensive care unit lobby. 

I didn‚Äôt feel like it was a huge deal, after all people have heart attacks all the time right? And he‚Äôs only 51, what‚Äôs to worry? My stepdad was a proud man he never admitted he was in pain or had any problems, he had a heart attack the week before and the day before his massive heart attack that put him into the hospital. 

When I saw him for the first time I broke down. The severity and gravity of the situation hit me like a freight train. I knew it was serious when I saw all the machines hooked up to him. I felt the helpless child that I overcame being come rushing back into me. 

To save you the gruesome stories, we ended up spending 4 days in the ICU in our first hospital and 27 in the second hospitals ICUs and went through dozens of surgeries and 100+ Vtacs ( basically afib on steroids ) and cpr and defibs. We basically watched him nearly die over 50 times each, sometimes together.  My mom and i slept in the hospital every night. We constantly stood guard over him and took day and night shifts so that someone was always with him. We took notes on procedures and medications and recorded every nurse and doctor so that we could look back and understand what‚Äôs going on. We slept in small chairs and very uncomfortable mini couches (and sometimes the floor) in the ICU lobby but we were so drained that anything worked for us. We legitimately spent more time in the ICU than any other nurse or doctor did in October. We fought so hard to make sure that we supported and cared for him to the fullest possible way. 

We ended up having to pull life support because we had maxed out every life support machine they had and 5+ doctors agreed there was no hope. It was so hard and by far the worst thing I‚Äôve ever experienced. 

Now I‚Äôm crushed. This man raised me after my bio father abandoned me. I never showed him the love he deserves. He left my mom and I enough money to live comfortably for the rest of our lives but I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôve been shot in the stomach with a shot gun  and I‚Äôm holding my organs in with my hands while I slowly bleed out. 

I‚Äôve drank and gotten high every day since he passed 10/23/23 just to not feel some of the pain. I know it‚Äôs a problem but it‚Äôs the only thing that doesn‚Äôt make me feel the excruciating pain of feeling like I lost the most important battle of my life and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. 

Everything reminds me of what I‚Äôve went through. Whenever I see a black Chevy truck I can‚Äôt help but wonder if that‚Äôs his truck. Anything slightly medical reminds me of the time i spent in the ICU. I can‚Äôt get him out of my head he‚Äôs all I think about.

&lt;p&gt;I barelyyyy graduated college in December 2022 with my bachelors after failing out of pt school and my mom and stepdad were so proud of me because I was the first bachelors degree college graduate in the family. I struggled to get a job but I finally got a job at a sketchy life insurance company that I quit 6 months later because it was a terrible job that took advantage of the elderly black community.  I got another job instantly after quitting and even got a large pay increase, even though I was burnt out on the industry I kept pushing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a random Tuesday morning I woke up to 50 missed calls from my family. The man who raised me had a heart attack (51 m) and was in the hospital. I rushed to the hospital at 4:30 am (1 hr away) swerving through traffic and driving way faster than I should have. Once I got to the hospital there were 20+ of our close family members in the cardiac intensive care unit lobby. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt feel like it was a huge deal, after all people have heart attacks all the time right? And he‚Äôs only 51, what‚Äôs to worry? My stepdad was a proud man he never admitted he was in pain or had any problems, he had a heart attack the week before and the day before his massive heart attack that put him into the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw him for the first time I broke down. The severity and gravity of the situation hit me like a freight train. I knew it was serious when I saw all the machines hooked up to him. I felt the helpless child that I overcame being come rushing back into me. &lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"Hello friends,

 Im here to share my story with anyone who might have been through something similar. I started getting treated for bipolar around 2-3 years ago but I recently had my first psychotic manic episode. This was a episode in which I accused my dad of SAing me in my sleep and got people involved.

 I also got back together with my ex etc.. My self destructive behavior led me to our local hospital that has it's own mental health unit. This is when my episode turned more psychotic and all the sudden I was in jail. This isn't who I am at all, I did lose a friend over it though. My ex's friend started spreading MY story to people that I went to school with not even relaying my trauma.

 Needless to say I have the hardest time leaving the house in my small town. My ex's friend works at the main grocery store in my town and so does a lot of the kids from my high school. Every time I go in there I see people who I know know about my situation. Im posting this so people know they aren't alone.

&lt;p&gt;I am ashamed. I fear for my future too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texted my doctor to let him know what happened and what I&amp;#39;m doing about it. I&amp;#39;m taking his lack of response as a vote of confidence. Maybe it&amp;#39;s not, and it&amp;#39;s just that doctor thing... Idk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;m a ravid dog. A beast that masquerades as a human. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living like this is painful and lonely. I&amp;#39;m so afraid of the future &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to make myself feel better. How to live even. This is messed up and I don&amp;#39;t to feel this pain, but I don&amp;#39;t know how to make it stop.&lt;/p&gt;

After a lifetime of sucking it up and doing what needed to be done, I finally realized I had a problem. The problem I realized, was alcoholism. I quit drinking because I got so drunk I fell asleep on the floor of the kitchen. My 16 year old daughter took a picture and as it turns out a picture really is worth a thousand words. There's a lot of stories and ones that are probably much worse, but that was the one that did it for me. That was September of 2022 and I haven't drank since.

 I came to realize (with the help and support of my wife and kids) that I needed more help than just quitting drinking. It seems I've been self medicating for so long I convinced myself everything was fine. It's not. It hasn't been for a long time. 

I started my mental health journey, and after a couple of incorrect diagnoses, I found out I'm bipolar. It actually makes perfect sense. The things I've read feel like they're being written specifically about me. It's wild. The realization is almost indescribable. I'm taking meds now and all things considered I finally feel... better?...Normal? I'm not really sure. Different. Not perfect, and far from better, but different. 

Today was a bad day though. I woke up angry. Angry doesn't feel like it does justice to the absolute blinding rage I feel. The notable part is that I knew it was happening. That didn't change anything about my mood, but it did give me the clarity to tell the people around me that I feel this way. I've spent the day trying to stay away from everyone. I don't want to start yelling and snapping and being an inexplicable asshole in general. I'm not sure when it ends. I don't think I have ever actually noticed it to this extent before. 12 hours later and I'm still furious. I don't want to talk to anyone or be around anyone in general. The thought of other people actually pisses me off. 

So is there a light at the end of the tunnel? I would say yes. I'm not ""fixed"" or ""better"" or whatever, but I'm starting to see things that I haven't before, and for me, that's a light. While my current mood is rage filled with an underscore of bummed out, I'm actually hopeful that one day I won't need to figure out how to cope, because it won't be happening.

,bipolar,"Bipolar diagnosed with several other things, along with borderline personality disorder. I think I‚Äôve been manic for about a week. But it is confusing because if certain stressors aren‚Äôt there/get resolved then I stop feeling stressed with racing thoughts/angry. So I can never tell if I‚Äôm having a bipolar problem, a bpd problem, or if struggling with both of them at the same time. But everyday for the past week and a half, I‚Äôve been dealing with lots of stress and intense anger. I can barely communicate/talk right/can‚Äôt understand simple things‚Äîit feels like I forgot how to talk/communicate sometimes lately. 

I am afraid to ask for help and possibly get admitted. I am working towards getting more or full custody of my son since the living situation is bad at his dad‚Äôs (I‚Äôm too stressed out to talk about it, and I‚Äôm not one of those parents that just wants to take my son away from his dad just because). I do not have any family within a 4 hour radius. Even if I did live close to anyone, I‚Äôm not close to any of them and I do not think I‚Äôd want my son in any of their care (this is a thought/belief I have, even when I‚Äôm not manic) for many reasons. 

I am afraid I‚Äôd have my son taken by the state/it would be hard to have my son back in my care once I got out, if I needed my son taken care of someone by the state on the days he would have been with me (his dad and I split the week). His dad got a new job where he works 5 days a week 12 hour shifts. The school goers don‚Äôt go back until the 2nd or 3rd of January. I would also feel guilty about not being able to spend time with him even if circumstances are better, but then again I am lashing out and not great to be around anyway. It has gotten to the point where if I am in a bad mood, I can‚Äôt see my partner because I end up taking my anger out on them about whatever I happen to be stressed out about. I don‚Äôt have any friends. I have one that I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôre still friends because we barely talk anymore and haven‚Äôt hung out since spring because I‚Äôve been revolving my life around being around my partner (not my partners fault at all). I do not know who to talk to. The other times I was manic (HYPOmanic, which is a less extreme version), my psychiatrist wanted me to check in to the hospital. I am also in limbo since she is leaving the practice the end of January (thank god), and my new psychiatrist is probably not going to be available right away‚Äîyou never know. There might be a gap. 

I am medicated, by the way. I‚Äôve gotten over that ‚Äúmaybe I can treat my bipolar naturally‚Äù phase. I take trazadone for sleep, so I have been getting enough sleep. Example, I got 10 hours of sleep last night. I take trileptal for the mood. Dose got doubled to 150mg twice a day, just last week. Will take a while for it to have any affect/improve. Antipsychotics work quicker, from what I understand. I wish I could get a shot of haloperidol but I have a son to take care of and can‚Äôt be knocked out without him being supervised for however long. 

I feel screwed. 

And even if I could check myself in, without worrying about what‚Äôs happening outside of the hospital, I swear there‚Äôs always that one shift with all of the mean nurses all at once. I also feel like the hospital can help, in some ways, but it is also stressful being around other people, that you don‚Äôt know, that are also not in great states. It amplifies my paranoia because you never know why some of them are there/what they did. 

If there is anything I can do to calm down with the anger, please help. If I have to admit myself, this would be the third time, and it does not get easier. I still get nervous as shit. Once the ambulance people load you up on the stretcher and they raise it up, you know its real and you can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI want to go home, I feel better‚Äù. The whole thing is confusing.

Asked about going home after several days and they said I‚Äôd have to write a letter and if it got rejected and I tried fighting it, I could be 302‚Äôed, which scared me into not bothering with writing the letter or however I was supposed to request leaving (paper that I signed when I checked in said 72 hour hold‚ÄîI also don‚Äôt understand why it says a certain time frame if you‚Äôre not 302‚Äôed).",t2_k1urp79c,False,,0,False,"When you need to be hospitalized, but you have a child and no one to watch them","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18tzooh,False,light,0.87,,public,15,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Support/Advice :shy:,False,15,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1703889789.0,richtext,,,,text,self.bipolar,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bipolar diagnosed with several other things, along with borderline personality disorder.

I‚Äôve done embarrassing things that I have shame from and am unable to look forward with any sort of hope. So many things have been destroyed and I find it painful to even put them into words. After being hospitalized, I decided to give life a real go again but find it impossible to connect with anything or anyone anymore. 

I feel a need to pick up and move very far away for a fresh start, hoping distance from the pain will help, however, my family is my only support system and leaving them would be difficult. I also don‚Äôt want to just run away from my problems. 

I‚Äôve taken on a very helpless/woe is me attitude. I‚Äôm just so tired but I want to fight this and find happiness again. I have a therapist and medication. I just started a new job where I make decent money. All of my basic needs are able to be met so I am grateful for these supports.

,schizophrenia,"EDIT

Apparently im banned from replying to the sub because i used the nono word in it.

But i'll be damned if i wrote it to the length I did and have it deleted, so I changed the word to Ignorant instead :)

HERE IS:

OK, so here it goes. I don't really know exactly how it all happened. But To get on the streets, I was living with my dad, after having just moved back to my home town from the Rocky Mountains. And his wife simply put, is ignorant. and would scream at me the way my mom does uncontrollably, and unnecessarily.... like ""Dude's got schizophrenia... I'm going to yell at him for taking my vitamin C pills... let's see how he reacts to that!!"". So then I went to stay at my mom's until I could get on my feet. Again. I had left some dishes in the sink, for no more than 3 hours, and I got back home to her drunkm on the couch, and talking to me as though everything was cool. I had no idea that when I went to go to bed, there was a pan, plate and fork in my bed, with a note that says ""I'm not your servant"". Schizophrenia seems to put a target on the person with it. People seem to enjoy seeing how you will react to gas lighting, and continue to call you crazy for it.  
  
It was that moment, I decided I wasn't going to take it any more. Even though it was -20(Celsius) in the winter time, I had to go. I couldn't handle staying at someone else's place and being subject to their random freak outs, and feeling like I owed it to them to take the abuse.  
  
I got checked in to a shelter. And got my ass in gear to get my job back at the tire retread plant, I had previously worked, and managed to do so. Gained employment 2 weeks into homelessness and got a job making $36/hour. I was set to only be homeless for a couple more weeks.  
  
Wrong.  
  
Even though, my life at this point was walking an hour and a half to work, and an hour and a half home, putting in 8 hours, and going to bed, I found myself getting my ass kicked, or bear maced, and lost my job very quickly.  
  
Shelters pay people to ensure your head is in the bed, and they get paid. especially if you are teasing them by only letting them host you for less than a month.  
  
Its scary and ridiculous.  
  
Anyways, as months went by, I was drinking more and more, and my mind would spiral. I really was, at times, the guy screaming in the middle of the road.  
  
One time I even threw my entire disability cheque in 20 dollar bills into the wind on the side of the road telling everyone to ""take it, you're all a bunch of fucks, anyways"" (1500$) in 20's gone. just like that. Before anyone is flabbergasted that disability is 1500$ here, ""why don't I find a place with that"" I live in a part of the world, where a 1 bedroom apartment is 1600 - 2600$/month nothing included.  
  
I got shot walking by a trap house on ""13th street"" believe it or not. Didn't even know I had gotten shot. I was on one of my rants, and i slipped on the ice. I landed on my back and thought ""Man... that really burns. I must have thrown something out in my back"" and went about my day. It wasn't until an unrelated X Ray revealed a .22 in my back 2 inches from my spine, I put it all together. Turns out, I slipped on the ice because someone shot my ass.  
  
I guess I scared a girl really badly while smoking meth with her in the grocery store parking lot. Because she pulled out a knife, and dragged it across my leg.. I looked her in the eye, while she was so stricken with disbelief at what she had done, and asked if she was ok before I realized the guy she was with also had a knife, and I should probably be more concerned about me being OK.  
  
Turns out, she was with the people that shot me. (I still have no idea why they shot me, I owed no money, I had hurt no one, but I would often ramble about some pretty crazy shit)  
  
A few months later, I went to the Trap house I had been shot by (at this point, I had no idea they had shot me) I was smoking a bowl in the living room when this guy named Smiley, of all things, says ""Is this him?"" while I was exhaling my hoot, He punched me in the face, but i started bleeding EVERYEWHERE. I tried to stay calm but the guy who was running the trap house told me to go before he stabbed me in the head again.  
  
So, then i realized I had, in fact, just been stabbed in the head, and I'm pretty sure, he was aiming for my eye. He missed. I now have a Harry Potter scar.  
  
I really had nowhere to go but the shelters, and the energy in those places is shit at best. and some don't do weapons checks.  
  
I once had to wander the streets and sleep in structures i made out of pallets in -20(Celsius) weather because the girl who cut me in the grocery store parking lot was staying at the shelter that didn't do weapons checks, and everyone sleeps in a gymnasium together with an L shaped wall around your bed so as to feign privacy.  
  
Anyways. I was losing everything every day. and everyone at that.  
  
Because I was homeless, and ""schizophrenic"" no one wanted anything to do with me.  
  
My father would almost daily, however, take me for coffee, and try to give me at least half an hour a day of some kind of link to the ""normal world"" but he couldn't do anything for me. all he could do was give me 20 bucks here, or 20 bucks there, to try to help me out, as I had been drinking a lot, and smoking a lot of stimulants (don't blame the guy... you have no idea how hard it is to see your son in this state, and say no to your child over $20 when you have a shitload of money). I wasn't going to make him choose his wife or me... anyways. besides the point. My father is a saint.  
  
I got so fed up with living the way I was, and the toxicity of where I was living. I asked my dad how much it would cost to drive me to the Rockies. (I was living in Kamloops, population 100 000, and where they dumped all the homeless people from Vancouver when the Olympics came.) The town I now live in, in the Rockies, has 5000 residents, and gain about 2000 more in the winter, as its a ski resort.  
  
He figured it'd cost $250 to get me to the Rockies. I had begged him to take me. He almost didn't as I had no game plan. I was just going to bring a tent, a lantern and a sleeping bag, and figure it out.  
  
  
  
He wasn't prepared to bring me here, if I didn't have a plan. He failed to realize, at this point, there are no plans. I'm sub human at this point. no one wants to even try to help me, no one wants me near them, my father has a hard time being around me,m its so upsetting to see. He was convinced I wasnt getting ym ass kicked, and I just missed work because I was drinking or something... I have no credibility. I'm schizophrenic... which also feeds into people not wanting to help me make a plan.  
  
I digress. I told him to fuck off, and I would hitch hike then.  
  
At which point, he let out a huge sigh, and said. ""I guess you leave me no choice then... we leave Friday""  
  
So, my old man and I went and bought a tent, lantern and sleeping bag, and drove 9 hours to the Rocky Mountains. to where I had ONE plan.  
  
I got dropped off at my old land lord's door, where I used to rent a room for $500. I knocked on the door (my dad had to take off before the door got answered in fear that my ""plan"" may not work, and he wouldn't be able to leave me knowing i would b camping in the mountains).  
  
So I knocked on the door, and my old land lord answers and says ""what are you doing here?""  
  
I said, ""Man, please tell me you have a room for rent...""  
  
He brought me in, and I told him my story for 45 minutes, and he said ""well, I'm renting to 3 other guys at the moment, but you can have my room. I'll sleep on the couch.""  
  
I now pay him $900 a month out of gratitude, I have since got a job at a local retail shop, There are no drugs to speak of here, and i manage to keep my drinking under control, even though, I still drink 3 or 4 times a week.  
  
I've put on 30 pounds, and life is great.  
  
I only hear negative voices if I drink too much, the rest are nice voices now, my visuals are those of beautiful naked girls (no joke) and I am finally feeling at one with the matrix.  
  
So yeah. It seems like there's no hope... but there is. Someone out there loves you. Until you find them, you got to keep going, and believe in yourself, and KNOW that the world is FAR more schizophrenic than you are.  
  
Schizophrenia is a label they put on strong people for the ""sane"" people to project their insanity.  
  
anyways, after writing such a long post, do i sign this or some shit?

Recently within the past 3 years maybe 4 I‚Äôve been having crazy shit happen at night and I mean hallucinations. It would only start at night and I would get zero sleep on these days, I would just be laying down in the darkness when I‚Äôd start to see shadows in the corner; what was weirder is they were always humanoid shaped and moving from corner to corner. The worst part is this would go on all night till I could see the morning light in my room. 

Most of the time I wouldn‚Äôt sleep for 2 nights straight because of this and I would be perfectly fine in the day. I feel like it‚Äôs getting worse, I have been stressed about school so I smoke weed/pot occasionally with friends and sometimes at night, but even before I smoked this would happen and it seems it‚Äôs started to stop now that I‚Äôve smoked most nights. I‚Äôve taken a tolerance break and it happened again, I could see the shadows walking and I used to be scared but now I‚Äôm not, another thing is that my fathers car has this very loud low humming v8. He leaves in morning around 2:00am to work and when I hear this sound slowly pass my room and leave the sound kept ringing in my ears all night, just a low buzzing and would sometimes get super loud then quiet like a music scale. I‚Äôd also get these weird visuals all over my field of view like water droplets in a big pond of water just small waves moving textures and shapes around my room changing colors. I‚Äôve never had an explanation for this.

One last thing I want to say is in my daily life I try my best to make things perfect; in the worst way. I try to stack things so they are exact or how I like it (maybe ocd), but I always think something bad will happen if I don‚Äôt. Like if the candles aren‚Äôt aligned I believe my whole family will be murdered or if I don‚Äôt open this door a certain way I‚Äôll die or even placing my water bottle in the exact place every time because in my mind bad stuff is going to happen if I don‚Äôt, I always have these feelings where I‚Äôm being watched so I‚Äôm looking out and making sure I‚Äôm not going to murdered by some rando. This has been happening for 3 years since the beginning of high school, I hate school with all my body and I avoid it as much as I can try it just stresses me out so much. The night stuff happens every once every 2-3 months. I just want ti know if this is serious or I‚Äôm crazy.

,schizophrenia,"hi everyone, i joined this sub reddit 5 days ago, and first of aƒ∫l i admire how all of you have the courage to talk about the ""voices"". Its difficult for me to talk about it because admiting that i hear them is forbidden (by the voices), and if i did, something horrible would happen to my family. 

After a cannabis induced psychothic episode, i was hospitalized because i was a threat to myself after my parents found me. 

i still drink cofee and smoke cigarettes, canabis is out of my sytem for more than 4 months now. 

i still beleive that this threat is real because of the non invasive brainwave analysis by AI. it can become a method of mass surveillance. i want to try and develop a method to false / hide my true intentions from my consciousness to hack this potential danger. But i think like it is only feeding into their training data. The deep state existence is confirmed. And whenever a technology can be weaponized it will be. 

throught some irrational conversation with my self im certain that if i die in any other way than suicide it can only confirm that i pose a threat for ""them"". So the voices will do everything to convice me to hurt my self, and therefore i have to listen to myself. 

I even tried to convice the voices that spying on me for there bosses is counter productive for them LOL. 

It results in tricking my self because of the voices

i dont know how to move foward, i have to do a 6month internship 

somtimes i feel like i can communicate telepathically. logic tells me that I'm have a delusion but it is still so difficult for me to come back to reality. because i hear tiny voices but i can't distinguish what they're saying. I'm battling between logic and delusions. and it goes on forever. sometimes i beleive that im some kind of evolved human being and that I'm being prosecuted by unknown entities, while my reason tells me that I'm imagining scenarios to keep my self entertained. an pathetic attempt to satisfy my ego, make my self interesting. because reality is harsh. 

it is easy to distinguish delusions but it is difficult for me to attach myself back to reality. i get anxiety from the delusions that i know are not real. 

i have nothing special thats the truth, but hearing voices makes me doubt that thus many theory emerges and it makes me lost. 

my most common delusion is telepathatic communication, especially in crowded places, at home too. i doubt everything i know, and my ""talents"" seems to fade, I have no idea what motivates me. the ideals i have are too farfetched and the road to get there seems too difficult. Add the constant delusions of being mind scanned constantly by a group of wealthy individuals, it results in me hallucinating about bunch of nonsense. i laugh at my own contradictions because otherwise its just too depressing.

because im not a diagnosed schizophrenic, I'm not even sure if i actually hear voices or over interpret any sound i hear, or reaction. the worst thing is that i feel privileged to have this condition. I'm like the laughing stock of my oppressors. they are rich, powerful, knowledgeable, and evil ( because of their mind surveillance program) and I procrastinate, have wealthy parents and haven't seized the chance to make something of myself, and ultimately stupid (iq and eq) because of my ignorance and contradictions. 

i should ignore my ideals seize every chance that my enviroment provides for me, while maintaining normal ethic and moral. it would mean pursue my career in finance, work in a financial institution or any company's financial department. i know that i won't be satisfied with this decision (nothing is certain but thats just how i feel for now). and starting something new now is like destroying all the efforts ive put in my studies before i lost my mind. the decision that i have to make now will be  crutial for my future, so im just turning in circles, delaying this decision, and ultimately giving up. 

emotionally, i was bullied in primary school, it is my core trauma, and i use it as an excuse for everything i fail. i don't know how the bullying started, race? age? wealth? these can all serve as an excuse to my overall bad character. in my mind i was beyond reproche, but thats my perception.

,schizophrenia,"I've been wondering if I might be developing schizophrenia for a few symptoms, but I'm most concerned with my negative symptoms. I felt like I had addressed the causes of my depression through drugs and therapy enough so that my motivation would improve,  however I'm still stuck with worse than ever avolition and withdrawal. It is uncommon for to feel specifically low mood (tearful), and my lack of suicidal thoughts dispite other depression symptom severity led me to believe schizophrenia might be more likely. Does adderall effect negative symptoms when dosage is constant daily? It seems like increasing my daily dose has never been beneficial, and I end up low motivated once I adjust to it.

,schizophrenia,"Very long rambling post but thank you if you read it all. I am using a throwaway account for privacy.  
For context: homeschooled M16 with no friends and I live in a country different than my home country so I only see my  parents and siblings when it comes to seeing family so I don't have a lot of social pressure.  
In  June of this year, my mom dragged me to a psychiatrist because she was fed up with my actions after thinking for years that something was wrong.

Doctor 1: I could not talk with the first doctor so my mom simply described the  physical actions she sees as ""obsessive"" and I got diagnosed with light OCD. I was put on sertraline 50mg and quetiapine 15mg. There was no improvement.   


Doctor 2: Could not talk again so she changed my meds to clomipramine 75 mg and fluoxamine 50 mg. I had a severe breakdown on these meds. Yelled to my ""fake"" parents to leave me alone because I  believed I was in a dream where something bad was going to happen and I kept hearing sounds of sirens and screams. Banged my head on the wall and tried to jump out of the window to kill myself since when I die in dreams I wake up usually, so that was my strategy to ""wake up"". My parents restrained me until I calmed down. This type of breakdown happens a lot to me and in it usually i accidentally hurt myself,  others, or break objects.   


Next time we went to that doctor my mom said  what happened and I decided to open up a little and said how I think I am being  watched all the time and cannot focus on even my usual  activities on my  desk like studying, drawing, or gaming because I see shadows of things looming over me, look back, and sometimes I either see figures or see nothing. I cannot resist the urge to look back because it always feels so real and threatening.   
\- I use LAN scanning applications to  check all the devices connected to the home network, check the MAC address's vendor and look up what that vendor makes. My worst fear is a vendor that sells anything camera related because I'm scared there will be a camera in my room that will record me or someone could be spying on me.   
\- Another thing is that i often see my mom and talk to her, when she is not even there.  Once while she was traveling  and I swore many times to her that I literally had conversations with her but she denied it.   
\- I often see insects and hear them  crawling in the wall next to my bed,  this can keep me awake at night for  hours. I got a bug repellent and sprayed it in my room and almost  turned it into a gas chamber because I didn't open the window, got caught and that's when I explained to my parents the  reasoning for that. I even once killed  one of the insects to prove to  my parents they're real but my parents always state they are not.   
\- I once believed a man was behind the curtain  and he was going to kill me  violently with his machete that i saw  peaking from the curtain if i  tried to go outside to tell my parents, so I sent images to my online  friend of how the curtain looks and he said it was flat and tried to state to me that it's not real until the meds kicked in and made me sleepy.   
The doctor said for sure I have schizophrenia alongside OCD and  put me on fluoxamine 50mg and quetiapine  25mg. My dad's cousin has  schizophrenia too so the doctor said it was genetic.   


Doctor 3: My parents did not like doctor 2's attitude so we went  to another one this morning.   
He says i don't have schizophrenia and it's just OCD. He put me on fluoxamine 200mg and aripiprazole 5mg. He says my hallucinations are normal things that everyone experiences. He said I act too normal and I'm talking to him normally so clearly I'm not sick with it.   


I'm so fed up with psychiatrists trying to mess up my  brain with meds that alter brain chemistry and I want to quit going there and to quit my meds but my parents won't let me. I feel like a lab rat right now. I hate this all and I want my normal life because I was such a smart kid. I'm still smart I believe because I'm graduating 2  years early in 6 months because I finished all needed highschool exams in only 2 years  instead of 4 but this is all so stressful.

Other symptoms I have: I have frequent handwashing and contamination OCD symptoms that sometimes I do not eat anything at all because I cannot get myself to go to the kitchen and touch all the dirty surfaces  and touch the dangerous tools that can kill me and the fact that someone can be staring and hiding in the kitchen or poison could be put in  place in one of the jars or bottles of food or drinks.   
Sometimes I see violent very visual or even auditory or physically sensational intrusive thoughts that are very violent and disgusting. My dreams  lately keep having disgusting sexual and gory immoral themes like me running babies over and shooting them in  the head and me violating my female family members even though I would never do it and I wake up feeling so ashamed that I think about  suicide.   
I believe my hands are evil because they make me waste time and I can hurt others with it so I  once tried to amputate it at home but failed because my parents came in and saw the scene before I did any  severe damage. I still believe I have an evil hand and my life would be better if i lost my right hand. I hear voices calling my name daily and see shadow figures or shadows of things where shadows should not be present.   
I get aggressive  when i try to protect my siblings from  possible harm like if one of  them is trying to hold a knife to cut fruit, I will get mad and yell without being able to control myself to take the knife before they stab themselves with it.   
The number 127 was a  number i got 4 times in a row from reading alternating dark and light reflections of light in different places in my house as binary code and converting it to a  ecimal number. The number 127 happened to be the ASCII escape code  for the ""DEL"" character and that  number horrifies me because I know it  means i need to delete something but as I don't know what it is, I always delete any files on my computer or throw away any object that has 127 on it. Once I scrapped a drawing I was working for days on because I realized it was 127 kilobytes and I shut off my computer promptly.

Is it possible to be aware of myself (most of the time, sometimes i'm not and I forget completely what happened or have faint memory of it) and have schizophrenia? Is it just OCD, schizophrenia, both, or  nothing and this is all normal but I'm getting medicated and diagnosed wrongly?",t2_r0n1nfbq8,False,,0,False,OCD and schizophrenia possible mix up?,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18ucprr,False,light,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Seeking Support,False,3,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1703931875.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very long rambling post but thank you if you read it all.

,schizophrenia,"Hello. I came here to describe my friend who has schizophrenia and if somebody could tell me if his symptoms are normal for this condition or are they the cause of the meds he takes or what. I would like to understand him more. I would like to educate myself some more on this.

So basically my friend who is 31 now, developed schizophrenia around 7 - 10 years ago. He doesn't like to talk about it. He did confirm to me that he has it and I also know this from other people. We live in a relatively small town. But he doesn't like to discuss anything about it. If I carefully ask him anything about it, he sometimes gets really defensive. He will just tell me that he does take meds and sometimes he doesn't want to take them and I know that he had a period where he wasn't taking them and i think his symptoms were worse at that time. Another thing I want to mention is that this condition probably came to him because he had a period where he did drugs every weekend (mostly ecstasy) and it really messed him up at that time. He still smokes weed occasionally and I keep telling him to not do any of that stuff and to try to live as healthy as possible but he won't listen. I sometimes take him with me to the gym or running but he lacks determination. 

So the main thing why I came here is to describe his symptoms: He has some really really strong concentration problems... You need to be really patient when you talk with him. It's very hard to even have a conversation with him. He will forget almost everything you tell him immediately and will often ask you the same thing five times or more. For example; if i tell him something he will always first respond with a pre-prepared response like ""that's cool"" or ""really?"" or something like that and I know that he didn't even register what I told him. I then wait 5-10 sec and then it finally gets to him and he responds appropriately then. I have to be sure to not say another sentence in that 10 seconds or I will just confuse him further. So it's very hard to talk with him, very hard to tell him longer and connected sentences because he just won't be able to follow. He knows he has this problems but it's impossible to discuss this with him because you can't explain anything to him and even if you go really slow he will just forget 80% of it...

He has parents and a brother that probably do a lot for him and he does visit his doctor frequently. That's all I know. Honestly I just miss my friend. He used to be the most outgoing person that was really fun to hang out with and everyone loved him. Now, it's impossible to have a real conversation with him. I apologize if I am ignorant but I know almost nothing about this condition and if someone could educate me on what he is going through, so that I can be more understanding of him. Are his concentration problems normal for schizophrenia or could this be due to something more?

,schizophrenia,"So, I've been labeled as depressive with psychotic symptoms by my former doctor. My gf thinks I'm actually schizophrenic (she has experience considering she is, herself), and hallucinations seem to confuse me a bit. 

I've always had intrusive thoughts, and there's a thing called ""visual intrusive thoughts"" where someone who's a visual thinker will get intrusive thoughts, but they're visual (i.e; thoughts, but they're pictures instead of words). I've explained a few of my experiences to her and she's said they're hallucinations but they don't seem to fit the clinical definitions of hallucinations. 

Example; the clinical definition says hallucinations feel 100% real to the person who's hallucinating. To me they don't necessarily feel 100% real, rather, they feel like something that's overlaying my world, rather than being a part of it. One of the only ways I've been able to describe this so far is with an example of art

What she's said are hallucinations, I generally see with around 10%-25% transparency. For instance, if I thought someone was in a hallway, and nobody actually was, then the person is as seeing would look almost transparent to me, and eventually would fade away. Think of a ghost; you can see though them but you know they're there. 

I've always referred to things like this as visual intrusive thoughts because they're not 100% real as if looking at the person in real life, rather they're just kind of overlayed in my reality.

,schizophrenia,"Hello, my name is Ethan I am new to the subreddit and reddit as a whole a little about myself before the rest of this post. I am a 3rd year student at a university for game design, but I have other hobbies like leather work where I craft sneakers, writing, and also really enjoy film. I like to diverse myself in creative endeavors and be introduced to new ones!

Reason for the post is that I am working on a video game for my academic project to depict schizophrenia. Reason being- after developing research papers around the project topic, it is not a topic depicted appropriately in mainstream games, leading to stereotypes and stigmas in the game space, especially showing the uneducated few on the topic. Movies and television often get criticism for what happens on screen, but I rarely see any video games that have done the same receive the same amount (especially with prominent characters). So, with my experience with mental illness between family and friends I wanted to attempt in creating an experience around a certain number of symptoms/experiences for a player to go through to understand some extent schizophrenia. I know a game like *Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice* is highly acclaimed in portraying psychosis. Though I jumped into this project to do the same and I wish to spread awareness by the end. I have read post about experiences, but never spoke to people appropriately or ethically feel comfortable in taking post and throwing them into a game.

So, I am here just asking for some advice and insight on the topic to be depicted in a game. If there is something I should focus on or something to stray away from it can help. If there are any misunderstandings that I may have that could be corrected. I do not want something negative or offensive in my portfolio or record to end my career before it starts, so anything helps. If some proof is required of this project, I have written papers and create game components, and do not mind sharing. I am not here to collect information as a form of studies of someone's experiences or opinion nor do I intent to survey, poll, or interview through this post.

Lastly, I know something like this would not be perfectly created or established, everyone is different. It would be solely on myself, but I am trying my best on all points to make sure my efforts would achieve something positively.

During that time Covid happened and couldn‚Äôt travel so I went to stay with family in Vancouver (main family is in Toronto). I had a psychotic break and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

&lt;p&gt;Recently I started drawing again for the first time in 2 years. I used to be a fine arts grad but I withdrew from classes to go travelling. During that time Covid happened and couldn‚Äôt travel so I went to stay with family in Vancouver (main family is in Toronto). I had a psychotic break and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. I worked for a year then couldn‚Äôt work bc of schizophrenia. &lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"I am on abilify now for a few years, and I'm worried that I am getting dumber because of it.  
Although I really appreciate not getting any severe psychosis again,   
and my paranoia has become weaker (although clearly not gone),   
I want to stay creative as much as possible,   
I want to memorize things I read in the best way possible,   
and I want to comprehend new stuff.  
But I have the feeling that since my medication, these things decline.   
I used to have a lot of things in my mind like different associations I've used in my highly creative states. Of course these associations also made me insane, because I connected dots that had no connection at all. But TBH, I miss that situation. Not the negative effects such as psychosis and paranoia, but the whole creativity that was going on in my mind and the euphoria that sometimes came along with it.   


Does anyone relate to this? Am I am just having unjustified doubts, or do antipsychotics like abilify make us less intelligent? I've read that some of them caused a decrease in brain volume, also my psychatrist once mentioned that this is the side effect I have to take into account for not getting sick again. But is my current state really better? Am I more healthy now if I feel a little bit like a zombie?  


Are there any people here who actually got more creative and intellectual WITH antipsychotics?  
I already considered to reduce my medication and take this risk, of course in agreement with my psychatrist. I'd rather have a colorful mind than a sane, but dull mind.

,schizophrenia,"To start, this post is by no means condoning sudden withdrawal of medication. It‚Äôs always safer to contact your doctor about it first.

For background information, I‚Äôve been on medication for psychosis, mood issues, and anxiety for around six years now (much of that time only being for mood). I always felt that it never treated my issues beyond hallucinations and delusions, rather only displaying healthier external behaviors. I‚Äôd be less isolated and more outgoing, but personally, I still didn‚Äôt feel too hot. Every time it had been a while since a medication update, the issues would be too unbearable for them to mask themselves and it‚Äôd repeat.

The same cycle, lasting 3-6 months each, for six years. Constant overthinking, irritation in struggling to express myself, and nightly senses of restlessness and despair.

Not the best choice, but I decided to cut off the source behind the back of my mom, who acts as my caretaker. I want to make it clear that I know it‚Äôs not safe and I‚Äôve been having awful physical withdrawals, I just don‚Äôt want to cause conflict with her.

It‚Äôs been a bit more than a week and I‚Äôm managing it surprisingly well. The most positive outcome being: I‚Äôm completely numbed out. For the first time in all those years, I haven‚Äôt been weighed down by my emotions. I can cry and laugh out of habit or instinct, but there‚Äôs no feeling backing it. The only thing I can feel is the pure relief of being away from it all.

To those who may read this and be concerned for my physical withdrawal symptoms: I will be discussing it with my psychiatrist tomorrow. My thought is that, if I can explain this to an unbiased healthcare worker and gain a go-ahead, I can go about this the rest of the way much safer with my mother‚Äôs trust in his judgment on my decision.

I‚Äôm so relieved that my mind is at peace with everything. I realize medication can be life-saving for so many others, but I‚Äôll be living without it unless something concerning comes up.

My thought is that, if I can explain this to an unbiased healthcare worker and gain a go-ahead, I can go about this the rest of the way much safer with my mother‚Äôs trust in his judgment on my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm so relieved that my mind is at peace with everything. I realize medication can be life-saving for so many others, but I‚Äôll be living without it unless something concerning comes up. I doubt anyone will read this ridiculously long post, but I can at least keep these thoughts down for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,My grandma been having forever  but gotten worse lately. She went through phases where she took meds and stopped and on and off again. I honestly dont know all the details as my father deals with it but its now getting out of hand and it needs to be adressed more.  He kinda puts it off as she lives by herself and he just sends ger money to live. She ismt getting real treatment and nobody wants to be around her ( rightly so but I feel bad). She refuses to take her meds as it makes her sleepy and she is stubborn and the voices tell her not to. She naturally a very stubborn and blunt woman but when you combine that with the schesifrenia it makes her unbearable. She came for Christmas this year and  she mocks the people around her and thinks me and my mom are out to get her son (my father) and stuck the middle finger at me and mom. She is mean to us when father us out of room. I guess the voices tell her that my mom out to get my dad even though they been together for 25 years and im the product of them therfore i get some hate too. Also their is a race aspect to it because their interacial couple. . She is constantly talking to herself. Even mean to the dog. As I write this she is downstairs just talking to herself in the middle of night .  She never been violent and supossally she knows that voice aint real but idk.  She will say sorry but start again and its even hard for her to say sorry sometimes. She is aware of her disease but it just seems like the disease is winning. W3 always knew she had the disease and we always treated her as if she was normal. but now we are starting to feel scared which is something we never felt. It's to the point where I'm sleeping with one eye open tonight.  Idk I just feel bad therfore I'm trying to figure out how I coud help my dad figure this out as he is all she got and me and  my mom is all my dad got and he already has enough on his plate .

,schizophrenia,"Hello, just making this post to see if I can get some help with my situation. 

My mum has had schizophrenia all my life (30 years) and always had an issue with medication compliance which usually leading her into hospital admission for about 1 month. 

Over the last year, she has gotten worse and is unable to recognise that she is unwell and thinks the medication is poison for her. 

Her symptoms are these delusions where she owns this really nice house and is the owner of a shopping mall. Few months ago, she acted on this thought and went to the house and demanded the people who lived there to get out of the house. Police were involved. 

Currently mum is on the maximum dosage of a depot injection of a medication that I can‚Äôt remember the name of. She is also advised to take quintiapine once per night however is non-compliant. 

Just wondering if anyone had any advice or tips for me as I am finding it very difficult to hold a relationship with my mum as all she does is brings up her delusions and she absolutely hates me as I am on the side of the medical team and advising her to keep taking her medication.

(not sure if this is the right flair to useüôÑ)

I'm really freaked out because I have a appointment next month seeing some lady who specializes in psychotic disorders but I've never really been tested for things I've not even been at the doctor much and I cried 2/3 times I've spoke to previous psychiatrists(one of witch was really mean btw)

it's probably to diagnose me with something because it's over an hour long
will they scan my brain that's my biggest fear do I have to sit in a brain scan machine I won't be able to do that
will she be mad at me for not taking my medication because no way I'm going if she's going to be negative like that

will she think I'm lying when I tell her stuff  because my mom told me I'm lying to get medication or something so 
a general idea for what to expect would be good :/ especially since I don't even think I have anything but since it took months to get the appointment I thought if I said I wasn't going I'd waste a bunch of people's time.",t2_d6wdoonc1,False,,0,False,what is the actual testing process like??,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18th6jd,False,light,0.86,,public,5,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice / Encouragement,False,5,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1703833978.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(not sure if this is the right flair to useüôÑ)&lt;/p&gt;
