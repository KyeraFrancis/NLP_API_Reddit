,Army,"Trying to become an officer at almost 35

Hi everyone. I am a male, 34 years old; I'll be turning 35 in a couple of months. I've had some familiarity with the military since an early age. My stepdad retired from the US Army as an E-8 in aviation. While we lived in the States, I was forced to join the JROTC (to gain some discipline at the time). I did it for a year, and after we moved abroad. I've been moving from place to place since then. I am looking at going back to the States and settling.

I hold a US Bachelor's degree in Philosophy and Psychology. And I have two Master's, both from a Spanish university online. One is in Education, and the other one in UX-Design. My GPA in all my degrees ranges from 2.4-2.8.

My career has developed mostly in language teaching. I am considering the option of becoming an officer either in the US Army or USAF. In the Army, I am a good fit for a Human Resources Officer, and in the USAF, I could potentially be an Intel Officer ( I did not find an HR officer on their website.

I am currently abroad, so I can't visit a recruiter. I am physically able to score 100 on the PT in both branches; however, I am approximately 30lb overweight for my age group. I'm 5'10'' with 220lb.

Also, I don't have any tattoos; however, I have a couple on my bucket list, and I might get them this year.

I would really appreciate any suggestions on how to approach this goal.

,Army,"Hello,
Not sure if this topic falls under here, it‚Äôs my first time posting on Reddit.

  I‚Äôve been enlisted in the Army for almost 2 years now and I‚Äôve been actively thinking about quitting. 
It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm in a shitty unit or that my NCOs treat me horribly, I have a medical condition that makes me non deployable (I can‚Äôt attend training in order to make me deployable) and I‚Äôm looking forward to a life of gate guard and arms room. It‚Äôs terribly frustrating because I was looking forward to the opportunities I‚Äôll get, but got my physicals back just to be disappointed. I believe it would get better with time (maybe), but the way everyone else is treating my non deployable status makes me want to quit and discourages me to go on. The thing is if I got stationed in a unit that doesn‚Äôt require any previous training in order to deploy it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered, but since this unit needs this class, now I‚Äôm just a shit bag getting all the jobs that nobody wants.

  Another reason I want out is that my fianc√© is stationed far from me and simply is hard to balance plane tickets and bills to see each other often. We have been considering the fact I get moved to a unit at their station after getting married, but from what I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs a gamble since we‚Äôre both active. 

  I wanted to propose the fact that I have no use in this unit if I can‚Äôt deploy (since this unit is on a constant rotation) and if they could somehow move me if we get married, but I‚Äôm not sure how this process works or if I would fall in my favor. 
Between balancing my health, mental health, and anxiety it has been rough past 6 months and started my new years depressed. 

The best result would be moving to a unit at my fianc√©‚Äôs station and living together and staying in the army till my contract is up, but if that‚Äôs not possible I want out. 

  My room mate had thrown out the suggestion of failing ACFT, but I feel like that wouldn‚Äôt work so well. My other friend suggested going to BH again and explain everything I‚Äôve been going through and get separation papers that way, but I don‚Äôt know if my reasons would be valid enough for that.
I‚Äôm not exactly sure what I‚Äôm trying to ask, but I‚Äôm just burned out and want to be with someone that wants to be with me and needs me. Is failing PT test or BH really the method to go? Would getting married warrant me a change of duty stations? I know there‚Äôs no way of avoiding hate and shitty jokes about how I‚Äôm trash and a quitter but at this point no matter what I do I‚Äôm no use to the unit and am trash anyways. I just want to know how the process would look like.

,Army,"Have you checked the HRC trends report for your MOS?  HRC periodically issues statistics not simply on the promotion point cut-off score for each MOS for promotion to SGT and SSG, but also publishes a look at the distribution of eligible soldiers by their current promotion points.  The attached chart is created from one of these HRC reports: SSG\_SGT-Eligibles-Trend-Report with the most recent being dated 4 DEC 2023.

In the chart, ranges of promotion points are shown on the horizontal axis (e.g. 24-49 points).  The bars represent a count of the SSG eligible soldiers and show the actual number above the bar.

If you are working towards promotion, this will give a clearer sense of where you stand relative to others in your MOS on promotion points.  Then you can strategize on ways to strengthen your position or to coach your soldiers.

As context using 11B, the SSG promo points cut-off for Oct, Nov, and Dec was 360, 357, and 396 points, respectively.  Also, in Dec 2023, there are 1220 SSG eligibles developing and moving towards promotion.  The average point score is 287 and average cut-off score over recent months is 365.

How does the distribution strike you?

Getting ready to go see a recruiter for the Army, anything I should keep in mind.

Background, i‚Äôm 16, in highschool, and i‚Äôve been very interested in the service my whole life. I‚Äôm not bad at school, my grades are very good and i‚Äôm in all advance classes. I‚Äôm considered a lot of things and a lot of options. Being an 18 series has been on the table for me, but i‚Äôve also always been very into human ecology and more specifically the way humans interact with each other. So that led to me into checking out HUMINT. I don‚Äôt know much, pretty little actually and I‚Äôm planning to talk to a recruiter about all of this and just want to make sure I know what I need to know going into it. Thanks!

Im in high school right now and I have plans to join the military soon when I join 18. I been doing a lot of research since I know this is what I want to do and I am stuck on either trying to become a Ranger or enlist as a 35L (Counter Intelligence Agent). If you have served as either or have an opinion of which I should choose, please let me know because they both seem like good options in the long run.

I'm about to start my 6th week of basic training, and I love the Army so far. I'm looking to really protect and serve my country, but I fear I'll be recycled if I don't meet the Army standards for the upcoming 7-mile ruck we all have after HBL or if I don't pass the next ACFT. Even if I get recycled, as long as I do not quit, they won't kick me out, right?

I'll continue pushing. I don't know how long it takes, but I just worry they'll give up on me. I hear a lot of people say the Army doesn't care about you, and I refuse to believe in that. I just want to succeed in this.

Almost set on going 11X, I am overweight (25% BF) | need discipline, I plan to only do 4 years as 11 series to see if I enjoy it. What should I be expecting/looking to get out of it?
I heard people while I was at MEPs saying there doing their airborne physical, but to be honest I could care less if I was airborne or not, I am more interested in getting the discipline / benefits out of it etc. I mean arctic or mountain would be coool tabs.
Anyways, should I expect a bonus/airborne option? (never asked my recruiter about it cuz I figured I wasn't qualified due to weight)

It's no secret that 15W and 15E Shadow UAV community are about to be restructured and reorganized in a way that could mean reducing and reclassing many soldiers. I've seen several post for advice on forced reclassing pop up and think it would be beneficial for a stickied post to be created. Give the Shadow guys a place to discuss the future of the MOS along with advice on what to do going forward.

Also, any advice on being reclassed? How the process starts and about how many offerings they give? Asking for a friend...

I‚Äôm 17 and planning on joining the Army next summer. I‚Äôll probably go talk to recruiters by January or February and just trying to make a decision. I‚Äôm mainly going into the Army for the experience not so much as a career unless I love my job. 11B and 12B both sound awesome but am worried I‚Äôll regret it from what I hear from videos I‚Äôve watched. I‚Äôve heard of people not getting to do the job they signed up to do very often and get stuck doing shit details. For anyone who has been a 11B or 12B or currently is one do you recommend going that route or is it not really worth it over other MOS‚Äôs I could choose. Also interested in a realistic week of what each of these MOS‚Äôs do since most videos only show the best of what they do and not a realistic day to day. Appreciate anyone taking the time answering my questions!

(question starts in paragraph 2) Took the ASVAB and went to MEPS back in mid August, scored an 85, DQ for an old asthma diagnosis and antidepressant prescription from 2 years and 8 months ago at the time, quickly did what was asked of me to get waived, received the asthma waiver, because I don‚Äôt have asthma, then my recruiter was able to schedule the psych evaluation, backed up until mid January, fine, whatever, been waiting since then.

My question: is my recruiter bullshitting me? He has said since day one I can get airborne even with the waivers, I have not received an airborne physical, when I asked about it the recruiting station (commander? Chief?) said they would put in a special order for just the airborne physical at MEPS. I have no reason to question their promises, although while looking it up everyone I see asking about it is being told you cannot get an option 4 with any waivers, so I figured I would float my specific situation by y‚Äôall. the recruiter has said I won‚Äôt be able to sign opt. 40 or 18x with waivers, but that I should be fine for an opt. 4, and can volunteer for RASP at airborne. (I know I will be able to volunteer for RASP at airborne if I choose to, my question is just if I will be getting an option 4) the final seed of doubt in my mind was at my first go around at MEPS, when meeting with the guy who could print out a contract (if I didn‚Äôt need waivers and was G2G) said I couldn‚Äôt get airborne with waivers, when I brought this up to my recruiter after MEPS he said the guy must have been mistaken, or meant I couldn‚Äôt get airborne until I get my airborne physical, I have just been getting so much info saying ‚Äúyou CAN get an option 4‚Äù, then immediately someone else is telling me ‚ÄúYou CANT get an option 4‚Äù As much as I would love to just take my recruiters word for everything, I wouldn‚Äôt be doing myself any favors by not seeking the opinion of people who don‚Äôt ‚Äúget a number‚Äù whether I sign or not. Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks.

Should recruiters let you know when they‚Äôre on leave? I‚Äôve been working with my recruiter for a while. We got to the part where he submitted my waiver and it got denied. He told me he will submit it again the same day I went to the office and would hear back by the end of the week. No word so I go back in later on and the boss guy told me he talked to his staff sergeant and that they‚Äôll submit my waiver then. Did they not submit it the last time I went? Texting my guy to let me know when it‚Äôs submitted and the results and I got no response. Apparently he‚Äôs been on leave for a little over a week. I didn‚Äôt know, he just disappeared and they‚Äôve been giving me the run around so I was under the assumption that they gave up on me.

Shipping FEB 5th to OSUT then Off to Germany as a 19D... ONLY option 19 to germany in my contract... Question is :   ""COULD"" I volunteer and get airborne during OSUT and potentially go 1-91 with the 173rd? or am I most likely going to 2CR  with no chance at an European Airborne unit?

I went to meps about a year ago and failed the hearing test twice, submitted a waiver and got denied. I was told I can go back to meps and try again and plan on going within the next month.

Has anybody had any experiences like this and gotten accepted to enlist? Any tips on what I can do to improve my chances of passing, or advice in general would be appreciated.

Been thinking about reclassing. I remember when I went through my MOS school the first time (AIT), that you could speed up the process and just take the test for that particular class week, and passing it would advance your progress. I don't remember what it was called. Can anyone help so I can look up the details?

What is AIT like?

I graduated BCT recently and will be reporting to Ft Gregg-Adams as a 91S soon, and was wondering what the AIR experience was like. I asked some of the DS's at Basic, but most of them gave pretty vague answers and said that it varies from base-to-base. Below will be a list of questions that I have. If you have the time, answers to any are appreciated. Thank you ahead of time. 

Will I go through reception again at AIT? If yes, will it be as thorough as BCT was, where they make you dump all your bags and check every item you bought? 

What is the living situation like? Will it be similar to basic where I'm in a bay with x amount of other personnel, have a room to myself, or be with just a few other bunkmates?

Following up living arrangements, am I able to bring my PS5 and monitor? Will I have enough personal time that it would even be worth bringing?

How does going off post work? Since I am not allowed a POV while in training, do I have to uber/lyft anywhere I need to go that isn't within walking distance?

I have a ton of questions, but I can't think of them on the spot right now, so maybe I will make another post later, but for now these are my main curiosities/concerns. Any input is appreciated, thank you in advance for your time.

Hi, when I enlisted into the National Guard, I took parts of a questionnaire that I found out was pre-filled when I did a background check for a TSA job application.

1.) Was it the SF-86 I was filling out before enlistment or was it something they use from it to gather relevant information pertaining to me?

There's a section on it that asks for foreign contacts and after swearing it, I find out that I'm in contact with a foreign national over social media which turned into a full blown relationship not too long after.

I come home from IET not even a day later and we ended things with each other but I have never been contacted by an investigator during my training and apparently obtained my security clearance while in BCT.

2.) Will I just have to contact my unit to let them know that I was in this relationship or will the information on the SF-86 for TSA suffice?

Jobs

Prior service here, looking to go back into my original MOSs but it‚Äôs under precision retention so idk how that‚Äôs gonna go. 

My grade determination came back and it said I have to choose from 35F, 35G, 35P, 35T, and 88H to keep my grade. 

Anyone know how life is in those MOSs? What‚Äôs the day to day job like? What type of units would I be in?Trying to figure out what I should choose as a back up option.

Attempting to enlist in the Army as 11B, failed my hearing test twice as an H3 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èThey didn‚Äôt clean my ears so I assume they didn‚Äôt see a reason to. From what I know, I don‚Äôt have hearing issues but clearly the test shows other wise. I can‚Äôt tell you the exact scores because I don‚Äôt remember, but I do remember that my lower frequency scores were within normal ranges, then as it progress to mid- high frequencies it got worse and pretty sure my highest frequency was at a 70 score. How likely am I to get a waiver for this? What will the process ensue? Will I be able to keep my MOS with this DQ? to be completely honest, I‚Äôm not even sure I did the hearing test correctly because I may have misunderstood the MEPS employee who only explained it once and I was severely deprived of sleep that day, should I mention that as a factor? I should also mention I have 0 problems communicating effectively in every day scenarios, I can hear someone having a private conversation from a closed room away.

I am a 17 yr old girl who is thinking about joining the army because I like the values and the structure, plus I like to get my hands dirty but as I was reading through reddit comments I see a lot of men who advise against women joining. I want to really know how the army culture is, like I know how most guys are and I can handle all the jokes and I can enjoy a few of them but I really wonder if there is anything that I have to worry about or any red flags that I have to pay attention to if I join. My family has told me to make sure to keep my eyes and ears open, but I was wondering if I need to take more caution.  The mos that I want to join is like a 13m

I had my option 40 contract taken because I got to meps and they said that I needed a waiver for astigmatism in my eye. I went back for a second time with a regular infantry contract and then they told me I cant go infantry because my eyes were not corrected to 20/20. I ended up signing a 19d cav scout contract because they were telling me i could still join the regiment as a cav scout but after researching I realized you can't. What would I have to do to join the ranger regiment? Could I just get eye surgery when I get out of bootcamp and switch to infantry? How quickly could I switch my mos? I signed for 3 years.

I‚Äôm 17 and my mom is making me join the military. I know technically I don‚Äôt have to, but I have to live with her and she‚Äôs my legal guardian, and she‚Äôs a terrifying person. I have too. She wanted me to join the Air Force but I guess they weren‚Äôt getting back to her when she was trying to correspond with them because I ended up talking to an army recruiter. I‚Äôm going to meps tommorow and after medical she wants me to refuse to swear. I don‚Äôt know about the ‚Äúpermanentness‚Äù (for lack of better words) of swearing at meps and if that makes it set that I have to join the army, but she‚Äôll get upset if I swear anyways. Who would I tell and when that im not swearing. I‚Äôm trying to avoid awkwardness and kind of do it as smooth as possible, I have no idea what I‚Äôm walking into tommorow and Thursday.  
(I also have a bad cold right now, I can work through life and stuff fine, but my nose is inflamed and congested asf, and I heard the meps doctors are strict. Will I probably not swear anyways orrrr?)

Hi everyone, 

I'm about to join the Army (obviously) and I really need some help picking an MOS. I scored a 95 on my ASVAB and have every possible job I could want which, tbh is a little overwhelming. I'm currently fixed on 25B and 37F as they I have personal interests in both and believe they allow for fantastic opportunities outside of the military. My main goal is to get an MOS I like and has useful skills in the civilian world, gain experience and familiarity with the military, and then submit a packet for SFAS. I don't want to join as an 18X because I personally want to advantage of some of the scholastic benefits I have access to while active duty. I would really love to hear some experience from guys in 25B or 37F but also just guys who are active and like their MOS or retired guys who found great success in the civilian world due to the experience they gained in their MOS. 

For added context I am 26, not kids, never married, and serving in the military has always been a goal of mine and I want to milk my benefits and come out as best I possibly can on the other side. 

Thanks in advance.

Did I do the MEPS hearing test wrong twice?

I failed 2 hearing test twice at MEPS. Does anyone know how exactly it‚Äôs performed? If I hear a series of 3 beeps in a row, do I push the button once at the first beep or do I press the button 3 times in a row?

Hello everyone,

This one is probably asked a lot but here it goes. So right now I‚Äôm 24 pushing 25 and have done  two office jobs and was terrible at both of them. I‚Äôve always wanted to be in the military but am curious about the office work load that officers get. Are you constantly doing paper work as an officer in the army if so should I consider being enlisted since I was pretty bad at being at my office jobs and would succeed better outside working hands on instead of being at a computer.

I‚Äôm a prior service Marine switching to army. For MOS‚Äôs I was offered either 13B or 19K. I‚Äôd like to do the full 20 and make a career out of the military. Which MOS would I have an easier/better career in? I know I‚Äôm stupid but I‚Äôm interested in both MOS‚Äôs. Completely aware most soldiers in 13B or 19K hate their lives. From my research it seems that 13B has the better duty stations and more duty stations to choose from and I‚Äôd have a better chance of going to schools like airborne or air assault. For 19K I found being a tanker slightly more interesting and I heard the promotions are really fast. Any advice would be appreciated. I‚Äôm being very indecisive.

What are the Female Physical Requirements?

I‚Äôm enlisting into the army very soon and I wanted to know what all females have to go through during basic training. My cousin is also in the army however, he is a male in infantry so I know that females don‚Äôt necessarily do as much as males. My mos will be a 42A but I would like to know the physical requirements for BCT so therefore I can prep myself such as ‚Äúrucking‚Äù, deadlifts, planks, push-ups, etc. Do/can females do knee-push-ups or full out push-ups? Also how long would I be rucking in duration of miles &amp; estimated amount of weight. I will also be in Fort Jackson, SC if that helps as well. I‚Äôm new to all this so I just wanna come as prepared as possible.

&lt;p&gt;Getting ready to go see a recruiter for the Army, anything I should keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background, i‚Äôm 16, in highschool, and i‚Äôve been very interested in the service my whole life. I‚Äôm not bad at school, my grades are very good and i‚Äôm in all advance classes. I‚Äôm considered a lot of things and a lot of options. Being an 18 series has been on the table for me, but i‚Äôve also always been very into human ecology and more specifically the way humans interact with each other. So that led to me into checking out HUMINT. I don‚Äôt know much, pretty little actually and I‚Äôm planning to talk to a recruiter about all of this and just want to make sure I know what I need to know going into it. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im in high school right now and I have plans to join the military soon when I join 18. I been doing a lot of research since I know this is what I want to do and I am stuck on either trying to become a Ranger or enlist as a 35L (Counter Intelligence Agent). If you have served as either or have an opinion of which I should choose, please let me know because they both seem like good options in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m about to start my 6th week of basic training, and I love the Army so far. I&amp;#39;m looking to really protect and serve my country, but I fear I&amp;#39;ll be recycled if I don&amp;#39;t meet the Army standards for the upcoming 7-mile ruck we all have after HBL or if I don&amp;#39;t pass the next ACFT. Even if I get recycled, as long as I do not quit, they won&amp;#39;t kick me out, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll continue pushing. I don&amp;#39;t know how long it takes, but I just worry they&amp;#39;ll give up on me. I hear a lot of people say the Army doesn&amp;#39;t care about you, and I refuse to believe in that. I just want to succeed in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost set on going 11X, I am overweight (25% BF) | need discipline, I plan to only do 4 years as 11 series to see if I enjoy it. What should I be expecting/looking to get out of it?
I heard people while I was at MEPs saying there doing their airborne physical, but to be honest I could care less if I was airborne or not, I am more interested in getting the discipline / benefits out of it etc. I mean arctic or mountain would be coool tabs.
Anyways, should I expect a bonus/airborne option? (never asked my recruiter about it cuz I figured I wasn&amp;#39;t qualified due to weight)&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve seen several post for advice on forced reclassing pop up and think it would be beneficial for a stickied post to be created. Give the Shadow guys a place to discuss the future of the MOS along with advice on what to do going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, any advice on being reclassed? How the process starts and about how many offerings they give? Asking for a friend...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone ever got or heard of getting a medical waiver for a past shoulder dislocation (mine was in 2017) get approved? Like how lenient is the army on approving that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been out almost two years in March. Thinking of reenlisting. Would I have to go back to BCT?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm 17 and planning on joining the Army next summer. I‚Äôll probably go talk to recruiters by January or February and just trying to make a decision. I‚Äôm mainly going into the Army for the experience not so much as a career unless I love my job. 11B and 12B both sound awesome but am worried I‚Äôll regret it from what I hear from videos I‚Äôve watched. I‚Äôve heard of people not getting to do the job they signed up to do very often and get stuck doing shit details. For anyone who has been a 11B or 12B or currently is one do you recommend going that route or is it not really worth it over other MOS‚Äôs I could choose. Also interested in a realistic week of what each of these MOS‚Äôs do since most videos only show the best of what they do and not a realistic day to day. Appreciate anyone taking the time answering my questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm new to the Reddit community. I tried to post earlier but it wasn‚Äôt approved. I don‚Äôt understand why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone is on antidepressants right now, can they join the army?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone had a minor fracture(not a break) in their hand in the last 4 years, without needing a cast or anything, will they be disqualified joining the army?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I scored 90 on asvab and my recruiter and family saying not go to infantry. My recruiter trying to push nurse but I‚Äôm not joining the army to be a fucking nurse. 5,10 155 pretty fit. Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/army/comments/18fr4sq/weekly_question_thread_12112023_to_12172023/kd21ald/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to Comment Chain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(question starts in paragraph 2) Took the ASVAB and went to MEPS back in mid August, scored an 85, DQ for an old asthma diagnosis and antidepressant prescription from 2 years and 8 months ago at the time, quickly did what was asked of me to get waived, received the asthma waiver, because I don‚Äôt have asthma, then my recruiter was able to schedule the psych evaluation, backed up until mid January, fine, whatever, been waiting since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question: is my recruiter bullshitting me? He has said since day one I can get airborne even with the waivers, I have not received an airborne physical, when I asked about it the recruiting station (commander? Chief?) said they would put in a special order for just the airborne physical at MEPS. I have no reason to question their promises, although while looking it up everyone I see asking about it is being told you cannot get an option 4 with any waivers, so I figured I would float my specific situation by y‚Äôall. the recruiter has said I won‚Äôt be able to sign opt. 40 or 18x with waivers, but that I should be fine for an opt. 4, and can volunteer for RASP at airborne. (I know I will be able to volunteer for RASP at airborne if I choose to, my question is just if I will be getting an option 4) the final seed of doubt in my mind was at my first go around at MEPS, when meeting with the guy who could print out a contract (if I didn‚Äôt need waivers and was G2G) said I couldn‚Äôt get airborne with waivers, when I brought this up to my recruiter after MEPS he said the guy must have been mistaken, or meant I couldn‚Äôt get airborne until I get my airborne physical, I have just been getting so much info saying ‚Äúyou CAN get an option 4‚Äù, then immediately someone else is telling me ‚ÄúYou CANT get an option 4‚Äù As much as I would love to just take my recruiters word for everything, I wouldn‚Äôt be doing myself any favors by not seeking the opinion of people who don‚Äôt ‚Äúget a number‚Äù whether I sign or not. Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family is putting together a shadowbox to commemorate my dad&amp;#39;s service, and we were struggling to find what a specific unit pact should look like. Are there any dedicated resources that might provide pictures of what to look for and from what years? We are trying to find what the exact patch he would have had being part of JCSE at MacDill in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should recruiters let you know when they‚Äôre on leave? I‚Äôve been working with my recruiter for a while. We got to the part where he submitted my waiver and it got denied. He told me he will submit it again the same day I went to the office and would hear back by the end of the week. No word so I go back in later on and the boss guy told me he talked to his staff sergeant and that they‚Äôll submit my waiver then. Did they not submit it the last time I went? Texting my guy to let me know when it‚Äôs submitted and the results and I got no response. Apparently he‚Äôs been on leave for a little over a week. I didn‚Äôt know, he just disappeared and they‚Äôve been giving me the run around so I was under the assumption that they gave up on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipping FEB 5th to OSUT then Off to Germany as a 19D... ONLY option 19 to germany in my contract... Question is :   &amp;quot;COULD&amp;quot; I volunteer and get airborne during OSUT and potentially go 1-91 with the 173rd? or am I most likely going to 2CR  with no chance at an European Airborne unit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been thinking about reclassing. I remember when I went through my MOS school the first time (AIT), that you could speed up the process and just take the test for that particular class week, and passing it would advance your progress. I don&amp;#39;t remember what it was called. Can anyone help so I can look up the details?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can i go to MEPS and not sign a contract? my recruiter is telling me that i‚Äôll go to meps for a physical and ASVAB, then come back and wait for an opening and i can sign the enlistment papers whenever i want&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is AIT like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated BCT recently and will be reporting to Ft Gregg-Adams as a 91S soon, and was wondering what the AIR experience was like. I asked some of the DS&amp;#39;s at Basic, but most of them gave pretty vague answers and said that it varies from base-to-base. Below will be a list of questions that I have. If you have the time, answers to any are appreciated. Thank you ahead of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I go through reception again at AIT? If yes, will it be as thorough as BCT was, where they make you dump all your bags and check every item you bought? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the living situation like? Will it be similar to basic where I&amp;#39;m in a bay with x amount of other personnel, have a room to myself, or be with just a few other bunkmates?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following up living arrangements, am I able to bring my PS5 and monitor? Will I have enough personal time that it would even be worth bringing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does going off post work? Since I am not allowed a POV while in training, do I have to uber/lyft anywhere I need to go that isn&amp;#39;t within walking distance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a ton of questions, but I can&amp;#39;t think of them on the spot right now, so maybe I will make another post later, but for now these are my main curiosities/concerns. Any input is appreciated, thank you in advance for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, when I enlisted into the National Guard, I took parts of a questionnaire that I found out was pre-filled when I did a background check for a TSA job application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Was it the SF-86 I was filling out before enlistment or was it something they use from it to gather relevant information pertaining to me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a section on it that asks for foreign contacts and after swearing it, I find out that I&amp;#39;m in contact with a foreign national over social media which turned into a full blown relationship not too long after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come home from IET not even a day later and we ended things with each other but I have never been contacted by an investigator during my training and apparently obtained my security clearance while in BCT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Will I just have to contact my unit to let them know that I was in this relationship or will the information on the SF-86 for TSA suffice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/army/comments/18fr4sq/weekly_question_thread_12112023_to_12172023/kdkxgmn/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to Comment Chain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempting to enlist in the Army as 11B, failed my hearing test twice as an H3 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èThey didn‚Äôt clean my ears so I assume they didn‚Äôt see a reason to. From what I know, I don‚Äôt have hearing issues but clearly the test shows other wise. I can‚Äôt tell you the exact scores because I don‚Äôt remember, but I do remember that my lower frequency scores were within normal ranges, then as it progress to mid- high frequencies it got worse and pretty sure my highest frequency was at a 70 score. How likely am I to get a waiver for this? What will the process ensue? Will I be able to keep my MOS with this DQ? to be completely honest, I‚Äôm not even sure I did the hearing test correctly because I may have misunderstood the MEPS employee who only explained it once and I was severely deprived of sleep that day, should I mention that as a factor? I should also mention I have 0 problems communicating effectively in every day scenarios, I can hear someone having a private conversation from a closed room away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a 17 yr old girl who is thinking about joining the army because I like the values and the structure, plus I like to get my hands dirty but as I was reading through reddit comments I see a lot of men who advise against women joining. I want to really know how the army culture is, like I know how most guys are and I can handle all the jokes and I can enjoy a few of them but I really wonder if there is anything that I have to worry about or any red flags that I have to pay attention to if I join. My family has told me to make sure to keep my eyes and ears open, but I was wondering if I need to take more caution.  The mos that I want to join is like a 13m&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a criminal history with no charges and some hand tattoos how likely is it to get multiple waivers approved as 32 yr old male? just began talking with a recruiter today and he said he did not want to give me false hope but he would be talking to his boss and be in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had my option 40 contract taken because I got to meps and they said that I needed a waiver for astigmatism in my eye. I went back for a second time with a regular infantry contract and then they told me I cant go infantry because my eyes were not corrected to 20/20. I ended up signing a 19d cav scout contract because they were telling me i could still join the regiment as a cav scout but after researching I realized you can&amp;#39;t. What would I have to do to join the ranger regiment? Could I just get eye surgery when I get out of bootcamp and switch to infantry? How quickly could I switch my mos? I signed for 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

I have too. She wanted me to join the Air Force but I guess they weren‚Äôt getting back to her when she was trying to correspond with them because I ended up talking to an army recruiter. I‚Äôm going to meps tommorow and after medical she wants me to refuse to swear. I don‚Äôt know about the ‚Äúpermanentness‚Äù (for lack of better words) of swearing at meps and if that makes it set that I have to join the army, but she‚Äôll get upset if I swear anyways.

(I also have a bad cold right now, I can work through life and stuff fine, but my nose is inflamed and congested asf, and I heard the meps doctors are strict. Will I probably not swear anyways orrrr?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m about to join the Army (obviously) and I really need some help picking an MOS. I scored a 95 on my ASVAB and have every possible job I could want which, tbh is a little overwhelming. I&amp;#39;m currently fixed on 25B and 37F as they I have personal interests in both and believe they allow for fantastic opportunities outside of the military. My main goal is to get an MOS I like and has useful skills in the civilian world, gain experience and familiarity with the military, and then submit a packet for SFAS. I don&amp;#39;t want to join as an 18X because I personally want to advantage of some of the scholastic benefits I have access to while active duty. I would really love to hear some experience from guys in 25B or 37F but also just guys who are active and like their MOS or retired guys who found great success in the civilian world due to the experience they gained in their MOS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For added context I am 26, not kids, never married, and serving in the military has always been a goal of mine and I want to milk my benefits and come out as best I possibly can on the other side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I do the MEPS hearing test wrong twice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I failed 2 hearing test twice at MEPS. Does anyone know how exactly it‚Äôs performed? If I hear a series of 3 beeps in a row, do I push the button once at the first beep or do I press the button 3 times in a row? I need to know if I failed due to my own negligence or because I genuinely have hearing issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is probably asked a lot but here it goes. So right now I‚Äôm 24 pushing 25 and have done  two office jobs and was terrible at both of them. I‚Äôve always wanted to be in the military but am curious about the office work load that officers get. Are you constantly doing paper work as an officer in the army if so should I consider being enlisted since I was pretty bad at being at my office jobs and would succeed better outside working hands on instead of being at a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a buddy who‚Äôs looking to join with me. He‚Äôs just worried about his genital psoriasis. He said it doesn‚Äôt bother him at all and it‚Äôs just a few red marks. He was never diagnosed by a doctor for it but he‚Äôs worried when he would go through MEPs a doctor would see it and disqualify him. What are your thoughts? Thank you in advance for the help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently a dep for 17E which I will be shipping out in sep of 2024 but as im looking more into 35t I feel like this mos could provide me with better opportunities after my contract. Any input on which mos would be better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm a prior service Marine switching to army. For MOS‚Äôs I was offered either 13B or 19K. I‚Äôd like to do the full 20 and make a career out of the military. Which MOS would I have an easier/better career in? I know I‚Äôm stupid but I‚Äôm interested in both MOS‚Äôs. Completely aware most soldiers in 13B or 19K hate their lives. From my research it seems that 13B has the better duty stations and more duty stations to choose from and I‚Äôd have a better chance of going to schools like airborne or air assault. For 19K I found being a tanker slightly more interesting and I heard the promotions are really fast. Any advice would be appreciated. I‚Äôm being very indecisive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the Female Physical Requirements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm enlisting into the army very soon and I wanted to know what all females have to go through during basic training. My cousin is also in the army however, he is a male in infantry so I know that females don‚Äôt necessarily do as much as males. My mos will be a 42A but I would like to know the physical requirements for BCT so therefore I can prep myself such as ‚Äúrucking‚Äù, deadlifts, planks, push-ups, etc. Do/can females do knee-push-ups or full out push-ups? Also how long would I be rucking in duration of miles &amp;amp; estimated amount of weight. I will also be in Fort Jackson, SC if that helps as well. I‚Äôm new to all this so I just wanna come as prepared as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"So to start off with some background, I‚Äôm a 15W that is waiting to start class so that I can become MOS-Q (Qualified) and head to my first duty station. When I was researching Aviation jobs that related to operating drones, I did not find much info on the different MOSs and their job descriptions. So I thought I‚Äôd share some with others now that I know. 

The drone you will be operating is called the RQ-7 Shadow. From my understanding, our classroom cirriculum mainly includes memorizing different emergency procedures, then just getting familiar with the operation platform and how to read the information on the screen.


In regards to the barracks life, everyone wakes up for PT at 0400, then we march to the DFAC around 0600. From there, if you are a hold (not in class) you walk back to the barracks in battle buddy pairs and have around 3 hours to be productive (nap) or exercise at the nearby gym. Our Company is made up of around 150 students all of which are 15W, 15E, 15C or 15M.


We have 3 formations during the weekday. All of which are for attendance purposes and to make sure no one is dead in a ditch somewhere. As for the busywork, depending on how the company ‚Äúbehaves‚Äù it‚Äôs between, picking weeds, cleaning vacant rooms on the empty floors of the barracks, or random field training (rarely) like LandNav or voluntary Ruck Marches which you can earn lots of promotion points for participating in.


Weekend/Holiday privileges are based on your phase status. Everyone (besides MOS-Ts) begins as Phase IV and is able to apply for phase up testing after 3 weeks upon arrival. As Phase V you are able to go 30 miles off post, can skip certain accountability formations and as a result have about 9 uninterrupted hours of the day to yourself 0900-1800. As Phase V+ (Final phase) You are able to store and consume food in your room as well as go 100 miles off post on weekends.

Now i wanted to know if its possible for him to get out of germany during his leave so we can go back stateside or if he has to stay here till his ETS date. (Im german and married to him, im sorry if my grammar isnt the best lol) Also wed like to know if hes requried to fly home via military flight or if hes able to fly lufthansa with me (we have two cats and a dog which we need to take on the flight back stateside, im not command sponsored so i have to pay everything on my own and fly with lufthansa.) well go back to florida and lufthansa wont fly animals after july as its to warm, now im concerned that he cant fly with me and we arent able to fly together in may or june. I honestly dont wanna fly without him and i wanna have all my animals there at once which means because of the airline restrictions that only two animals are allowed per person. 

im sorry if i wrote absolute nonsense lo but so far noone is able to give us some kind of answer. We are gonna ship his car back hopefully as soon as we get the orders. now i wanna know if someone did leave before ETS date and what have you done to be able to do that? how does it work to ship household goods and is he able to fly with a ""normal airline""?

Is it possible to get reimbursed for the difference by Florida if I register it there since it‚Äôs my HOR on my LES? I do not have a Florida DL anymore nor do I have a Florida address there as it‚Äôs been 15 years. 

Any insight or help would be great.

,Army,"Ok, so bear with me here. 

I‚Äôm conflicted because I have a couple of options that I‚Äôm weighing out but I ultimately want to go Civil Affairs. I have the option to do SMP Cadet (something like ROTC) and essentially sign with an MOS (68W), finish up my school after about 3yrs but with this route, it requires that I commission as an officer upon graduation (complete either 8 years reserve upon graduation or compete for Active Duty [4yrs]), and as far as going CA I‚Äôm aware that I‚Äôd be looking at around another 3-4 more years before I‚Äôd even be able to put in a packet for a CA Officer. 

OR

I can directly enlist as a 38B in the Reserves and wait some time (say 2-3 years) and then try to go Active Duty and attend CAAS. During this time in the reserves I‚Äôd also like to finish my school in person (if possible), I‚Äôm guessing this way I won‚Äôt have to go the Officer route.

Also, how long would it take me to reach the required rank of SPC in the reserves component?

OR

I‚Äôve thought about the prospect of enlisting Active Duty as a 35P (which I‚Äôm aware I‚Äôd have to go 35W), gaining valuable language skills and then putting a packet in for Civil Affairs when I reach the required rank (not sure on the timeframe). 

Any guidance or suggestions are appreciated. Which of these makes more sense?

Well it made me relic on my first duty station, showing up to 2CR as an 18 year old 11b in December 2011. 

The details are all important because I had A. No experience in the world, and now I‚Äôm suddenly in Europe with an old Samsung phone that slid up for a keyboard and a laptop with a US outlet. The phone was basically dead but before it died never fixed the time and I didn‚Äôt have anyone to ask the time. I show up to the unit, get yelled at for about an hour and get picked up by some SSG who tells me I‚Äôll be in the scout platoon, however, I hadn‚Äôt tried out for it so it fuckin sucks to be me. Also - in December, if you didn‚Äôt know gets dark AF early in the afternoon in Germany. Didn‚Äôt know that either.

The SSG takes me to the PX to get some blankets and whatnot, I think we discussed timezone differences but again my phone was done for and nobody including him told me about the outlet situation and I hadn‚Äôt been to the barracks yet. We get to the barracks and everyone has a roommate who sleeps in the same room with them, except for me. There is nobody there to give me a heads up on anything. Ole NCO tells me to be at PT at 5:45 in ACUs so I can do in processing at 0800 (üòë). I tell him I don‚Äôt have an alarm and all he told me is CQ will wake me up at 5:30. After this I walk across the hall and knock someone‚Äôs door and ask if I could borrow Wi-Fi for the night to know what time it is and the dude tells me no cause he doesn‚Äôt want my porn lagging his Xbox and slammed the door in my face (didn‚Äôt matter I didn‚Äôt have a plug for my phone or laptop anyway)

Next morning I wake up to absolute beatings on my door by a ton of specialists who had just got back from Afghanistan FREAKING OUT at me because it was 0600 and I hadn‚Äôt shown up yet. Once I‚Äôm fandangled into uniform I ask the CQ if they ever knocked on my door and these dudes just chuckle and go back to doing nothing. I show up to my platoon area where my acting PSG (who I don‚Äôt know and is in PTs) is going OFF on me about how every infantryman should have an internal clock and know what time it is at all portions of the day.

Seeking anyone‚Äôs experience with attending the National Intelligence University‚Äôs part time or monthly Masters of Science in Strategic Intelligence program. Also curious about anyone‚Äôs experience with their graduate certificate programs.

Previous posts have provided some details but I‚Äôm curious about:

- how difficult it was to balance the curriculum with work while maintaining a personal life

- Is all your work conducted in a SCIF or are you able to complete some readings and assignments from home? Is it logistically challenging to conduct thesis research?

- how does the monthly program work? Classes all day during a weekend and then you spend the time between weekends doing assignments/research?

- was the experience and education worth the time? Can you leverage the degree for post-army employment?

**Getting Fit: An Overview**

**Four levers to pull:**

**Training**: this is where you force adaptations in your body to get stronger, gain endurance, etc.

**Nutrition**: this is where you fuel that magnificent beast of a body and lose fat

**Activity**: this is where you stop dying early and help burn calories

**Sleep**: this helps your body recover and benefit from the other levers

**Training**: Try and get in at least one session a week of those four kinds of training:

* *Strength*: this could be barbells or machines at a gym, or pushups, pullups, and air squats at home. It could be Pilates or power yoga‚Äîanything where you are doing sets of movement that push your muscles. Don‚Äôt stress over particular programs, set/reps, etc. If you do 3-5 ‚Äúhard sets‚Äù (like maybe you had another 1-2 movements in you), for basic movements like squatting down/picking things up, pushing away, pulling towards, lunging forward/sideways, and twisting, you will get stronger.
* *Cardio/Zone 2:* jogging, rucking, powewalking, biking, etc. Half an hour at a moderate pace, like 60-70% of your max heart rate (220-age). Don‚Äôt go too hard or you miss the benefit! This is your base of your endurance.
* *Metabolic/HIIT*: bursts of activity that are close to maximal: skipping rope, elliptical, sprinting, etc. The goal is to get your heartrate up very high for working sets, with active recovery in between. I like 30 seconds work/1:30 active recovery. You could do 1 minute on/1 minute recovery, etc. But something like an 8-9 on a scale of 1-10 for work, and then drop to a 5-6 for the recovery period.
* *Mobility*: just go to youtube and find a 20-30 minute routine you like (Julia Reppel and Tom Morrison are good).

**Nutrition**: This can be overwhelming, and in a culture where we are surrounded by tons of crappy food. Some manageable suggestions:

Focus on getting in good food. When you eat high quality food, you will be less likely to eat crap. Also, good fuel will help you train, recover, and improve your body.

*Eat whole foods instead of processed foods; cook as much as you can instead of take-out*. Think of Panera and McDonalds as poison dispensaries; fruit juice, granola bars, breakfast cereals, store-bought muffins, breads, and cakes are all pretty much posion. Poison, poison, poison. Replacing poison with nuts, drinking milk, searing proteins like fish and chicken, eggs, cheese, broccoli/Brussel sprouts/cabbage, etc. is a huge move in the right direction.

*Don‚Äôt kid yourself*: it doesn‚Äôt matter what some calorie counter/TDEE website says. Over the course of a week, scales aren‚Äôt informative, but over the course of months they are. If you are not gaining muscle and want to, add a small portion of food daily. If you are not losing fat and to, cut out a small portion of food daily. Reassess every two weeks and cut/add as needed.

*Cut out some obvious crap*: empty-calorie drinks like soda or caramel-frappalacho iced vente w/ extra pump+cream, potatoe chips/fries, ice-cream, etc. Set a boundary you can follow, e.g. you will have 2-scoops of ice cream once on the weekend, a peppermint latte w/ extra sprinkles. The important thing is to identify something clear you can cut out to reduce calories in (assuming you want to loose fat)‚Äî‚Äúeat less‚Äù will never work, but cutting out the mid-AM hostess snack cake daily will.

*If you drink alcohol, consider setting clear bounds to reduce consumption*, e.g. if you have a couple beers most nights, set a clear rule that you will only have 3 beers total Fri-Sat.

**Activity**: very simply, a sedentary lifestyle is deadly. Every hour you spend on the couch watching Netflix chips away at your life and health, while every hour walking/gardening/doing chores/playing with your kids is life-extending/improving. Find a way to move more often: go for a 30 min walk after dinner.

**Sleep:** Find a way to get in sleep: a cool room, no lights, calm before you go to bed, no using the bed for anything other than sleeping (and makin‚Äô whoopee), regular bedtime‚Äîwhatever it takes.

Essentially I am transitioning &amp; got a offer to take a 120 day skill bridge internship with General Dynamics.   The only issue is that I have 87 days of leave on the book and the program goes for 120 days. It would start in April &amp; end August 1st my final day of my contract. 

My direct SNCO wants me to be able to use it because he truly thinks that my current unit doesn‚Äôt need me as I am not used for anything but the rest of my Chain isn‚Äôt too much on board because they want me to ‚ÄúTrain my replacement‚Äù who would arrive after the start date. Im in one of those units in which we honestly have Marines for the sake of having Marines.  Like that one commander that doesn‚Äôt use his Marines but will never admit it because he enjoys the idea of having extras on standby.

Here is where I have a issue.

1. The command I am apart of is Top heavy and as you know in Top Heavy commands Sergeants don‚Äôt do much.
2. If I go on skill bridge the command won‚Äôt approve my leave and there reasoning for is that Im supposed to use my leave dates for skillbridge which I know is false &amp; their stubbornest will make me have to sell 80+ days when I dont do anything at all.
3.  The Average work day is from 0800 - 1500 and I am serious.  It is literally a ghost town come 1430/1500. On top of that I don‚Äôt even do anything. Seriously I spend 90% of the day on youtube because my job is just misc stuff they don‚Äôt want to do like organizing files.  It usually two meetings day then every one goes home.
4.  I find it hard to think that they can‚Äôt afford to lose but others in the shop can go TAD for sports games.


How should I go about doing this.

A Marine made a few untimely decisions (how many times have you heard a story start like that) got in a loud argument with his wife in a public place, and got himself 3 hots and a cot for a while - next court date is January 8th. He is also facing four felony counts as the result of him hitting his van (wife and kids were in the van) with his truck. 
Wife is not pressing charges. She never wanted him arrested. 

He knows his actions are his responsibility and knows too that he done fucked up. This is his 1st negative interaction with local law enforcement. He was arrested and charged with: four felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill; three misdemeanor counts of child abuse; one count of communicating threats; and one count of hit and run failing to report property damage.

He is also facing four felony counts as the result of him hitting his van (wife and kids were in the van) with his truck. 
Wife is not pressing charges. She never wanted him arrested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He knows his actions are his responsibility and knows too that he done fucked up. This is his 1st negative interaction with local law enforcement. He was arrested and charged with: four felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill; three misdemeanor counts of child abuse; one count of communicating threats; and one count of hit and run failing to report property damage. 
He is being held in the county Jail on a $500,000 secured bond and is scheduled to appear in court Jan. 8.&lt;/p&gt;

Coming from a 6 year reservist. I dont care what bullshit you have against reservists or the current marine corps. What keeps you guys going, is the spirit. The spirit to keep it together to do your thing. Whatever it is. 

But tonight, we celebrate. Another year gone by. I love the corps. For its marines,  Its history, and their ability to adapt and overcome. I hope I‚Äôm not the only one.

Well tonight, I just wanted to say, I hope you are all safe, comfortable, and with good company. Nothing better than a group of leathernecks and go getters. The world is expecting. Hold your own and keep it together right?

I‚Äôm here for you. I can‚Äôt help but know there are some of you here tonight looking for a voice. Something to read. I‚Äôve been there. I love you guys and girls. You‚Äôre doing what needs to be done, but with little gratitudes‚Ä¶marines don‚Äôt need gratitude. We know we‚Äôre good to go. But it takes a lot to admit that we do need some camaraderie. 

Too all you killers out there, I hope your in good spirits, good health, and good company. Don‚Äôt neglect. Do yourself something no one else would do. Hit the gym. Hit the chow hall. Go out with the group. Be kind and hit hard when it counts.

If yalls plan is to distract commands and have their attention at 1443 go ahead and assume some initial success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink responsibly so those on duty  tomorrow don&amp;#39;t have a worse night than already being on duty. One of the said memes (from DD214memes) for yalls time, can&amp;#39;t imagine if there is actually a Cpl Hyde and how many calls they will be getting but that person is a meme in and of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

,USMC,"Not sure if the picture helps but is there a way you can tell if the Inactive Duty Points ""NonPaid"" (-it shows the number 4 second row down) relate to Disability Income taken in lieu of ""drill pay""?  We've run into this before YEARS ago-forgot about the $100/month disability he was receiving but he was also Active reserves  collecting drill payments and we had to write a check for almost $4000 to   
 reimburse because they continued VA payments throughout the years.

He was rated 100% disabled end of 2019- and I think we ran into this again. 

He was an 0-6 with 28 years of service. Is there a way someone can look at thisandcan calculate:

The second link has some of my data breakdowns.

When filtered by branch, a lot of the questions had trends that matched the overall answers. I didn't spend time making separate graphs for those because it looks the same as all the answers combined. The branches match, the only difference is how many in each branch answered the question.

Welcome back from your research. Here's the deal, I fully realize that this little ~~fetish~~ census is flawed in several fashions. Here's my shit list of all the ways I fucked this year's census up. If any of you have suggestions for next year that I haven't already discussed, hit up my inbox. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

* I only noticed that I didn't include a question asking which branch you're a part of after 13 people already submitted answers. Fixed it live from my phone, but still.
* My dumbass listed warrant ranks as CW-02 instead of CWO-2.
* I busted my own deadlines! Sinceriously sorry about that. I vastly overestimated my bandwidth and writing this up repeatedly fell to the bottom of the to do list.

Anyways, now that I've taken some time to look a bit deeper than face value at all this data here's what I've found.

# Basic Facts

* Y'all made 1,123 submissions. The ratio of branch submissions shaped how most questions were answered. In most charts, the disparity of answers per branch matched the disparity below. I only bothered making my own charts if I saw a trend that broke from this mold.
   * Air Force: 462
   * Army: 258
   * Coast Guard: 85
   * Marine Corps: 69 ^(nice)
   * Navy: 107
   * Space Force: 70 ^(tried too hard for nice)
   * Blank: 72
* I didn't make a chart for the question regarding your unit encouraging attending sick call or medical appointments, but I did notice something unique. The Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, and Space Force all increased in submissions as the likelihood of encouraging attendance increased from 1 to 5. The Navy was about even across 1 to 3, but did have more submissions for 4 and 5 proportional to the other services. Then, the Marine Corps were roughly equal in submissions across all 5! They really are a cult. Look, real talk for a moment. Don't sacrifice your body for your service if you're supporting peace time ops. And if you do, don't chaff getting rated with the VA as if you didn't earn it. Y'all take care of yourselves!
* Also, there were a few questions that I thought were easy pickings for branch comparisons even if the Google Forms results don't show it that way. I've made a little imgur gallery for six of them that y'all can check out [here](https://imgur.com/a/xgKqDEd). Probably fun for the number nerds out there but I'm not sure who else gets down like that, so...

# Generals

* Three of you claim to be generals in our midst! One is plausible... but the other ""two"" I'm not so sure about. While all three ages match (50+), two of y'all are AH-64 Apaches serving as ""Class IX"" employees in the Army, commissioning with a degree in cunnilingus, would rather fight 3x other generals than other ranks, use condoms 24/7 as COVID preventative measures, claimed spanking as their highest form of punishment (though I have a feeling it wasn't punishment for the receiver since their favorite form of supervisors correcting troops without paperwork is using ball gags), and would implement Titty Tuesday if they were \[AH-64 Apache\] For a Day. You know, just your based pervert, basically.
* On second thought I think the plausible one is probably u/SilentD testing the submission form... so no Generals this time around. Don't worry, you can be my Lieutenant General anytime, boo! o7
* Also, there's something to be said about our willingness to pose anonymously as any of the General ranks... but not a single soul nutted up to be a CWO-5. Y'all know you'd get force choked even thinking about it, haha.

# Levels of Punishment

* You know, I think the one who listed 'marriage' and another who listed 'heavy spanking at home' should probably get together.
* More than a couple of you got 'your balls smoked off' or some variation like 'Just had my ass smoked. Made 20-year old me sit down and take a breather like a 45 year old at their first BJJ practice,' lol. I appreciates handling the situation old fashioned and off the books.
* There was a fair amount of extra duty and paperwork for juniors and seniors being on an episode of When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong. Good reads if y'all wanted to grab some shovels.
* The Marine Corps had the lowest 'None' and 'Verbal' responses among the branches, but the highest 'Extra Duty' and 'Administrative Paperwork', with the second highest 'Article 15'. Conversely, the Space Force had the highest 'None'. I think we all saw those coming a mile away, lol.

# THERE I WAS...

I handle the THERE I WAS question Clint Eastwood style through the categories of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. The Good are tales that are lighthearted, funny, or of benefit to the storyteller. The Bad are tales of fucking up somewhere in the chain and leaves a downer taste in your mouth. The Ugly are tales that give me a bit of a cringe as I read them. These responses are cherry picked exactly as submitted; no edits have been made.

* The Good
   * When I first check on my ship they put us in an overflow berthing where marines were supposed to stay. They‚Äôre was HUGE dent in one of the bigger stand up lockers. After about a month someone had the video of happened, several marines used a singular marine as a battering ram and slammed his in the locker several times without a helmet. The also broke all of washer and dryers on board in a similar way with the writing of ‚Äúbroken courtesy of the USMC""
   * Baghdad 2007, walk in fresh off the plane, Army Col looks up, sees me, says ""come with me."" Go into a section, he yells for the SFC, who comes running. He tells the SFC, ""This is SSgt XXX, he is your new section chief. Understood!?"" SFC replies yes. I didnt get it then, but within two weeks, it was perfectly clear. On his NCOER, under leadership, I wrote ""the only reason anyone follows this man is to see what he will fuck up next.""
   * I got bitched at by an Air Force E6 for using profanity when talking to other Army E4‚Äôs (combat wounded guys in the hospital with me) told we weren‚Äôt professionals talking like that‚Ä¶AND THEY (USAF) WERE AUTHORIZED TO WEAR CROCS IN PTS BECAUSE IT WAS HOT
   * \[Editor's Note: I'm not going to put them in here because they're COALITION and not JOINT you numbskulls, but there's several funny short stories about working with other nations if'n you wanted to go diggin'.\]
* The Bad
   * It wasn't a group but I did my Corporal's Course at Henderson Hall in DC. My unit was actually on Fort Meade, MD but this was the nearest we could get for the course. They put us up in army barracks. It was so bad, rats ate through our cammies. We had to hang all our shit from the ceiling otherwise they would chew through it. I lost 3 pairs of pants and a blouse that they had eaten through...
   * I was an Air Force Academy cadet on exchange to the Naval Academy. I can definitely say that my school (Air Force) is a college where we put on uniforms and pretend to be in the military. Navy was a real military academy. There were pros and cons to both. Navy had way better esprit de corps, but Air Force had infinitely more common sense with what seemed like very obvious shit. Case in point. If it's late hours at the Naval Academy and you require medical attention for anything (including emergencies), you are supposed to call the duty officer, have him or her coordinate a ride to the hospital an hour away, have them inform your chain of command, and only then can you actually go to the hospital. If anyone in that chain doesn't pick up their phone... well.. hope the problem isn't \*too\* urgent. The Air Force by contrast, the sequence is; wake up anyone with a car, get to the hospital, and \*then\* figure out who you need to contact for accountability.
* The Ugly
   * There I was in a Joint Command. Of all branches, Army is the only one that does not have a functioning SHARP or EO Program. Someone comes on the net on the watch floor that wanted to file a Sexual Harassment complaint. I had been trying for 6 months to get audience with the CDR with Stars on his chest to let him know about this deficiency, to no avail (because the lack of EO Program meant we didn‚Äôt have an Open Door Policy either, as noted by the Element CSM at the time who is now thankfully retired). It was embarrassing that no one in the Army Element anywhere could tell this SM, or the CMSgt in the AF, where our Soldiers could file a complaint to receive help. We‚Äôre doing better on the SHARP Program over a year later, but we still haven‚Äôt had any presence from an EOA in the Command
   * \[Editor's Note: I won't put any one particular in here to not belabor the point, but damn there are quite a few stories about the Navy's E-O divide, competency, and fitness.\]

# King / Queen for a Day Hits

* \[These were givens, honestly\]
   * B E A R D S
   * Actually releasing for the day when the work is done
   * BETTER PAY HOLY SHIT PLEASE PASS THE 30% JR ENLISTED PAY
   * Homesteading
* If a command doesnt immediately start an investigation into a report of sexual harassment, sexual assault or regular assault the senior person with knowledge of the allegation is relieved for cause.
* Step Promotion is decided by trial by combat.
* Boot bands not being required for some friendly bonding.
* \[Honorable Mention\] Space Force Chief Master Sergeants are now referred to as ‚ÄúMaster Chiefs‚Äù (Same response I gave in the 2020 census because this is, in fact, the hill I‚Äôm willing to die on)
* \[Dishonorable Mention\] Everyone has to watch a season of anime every quarter.

# Branch Retention

* Air Force: 75.96% (Next highest: 7.93% I'd go back in time to punch myself in the face)
* Army: 29.33% (Next highest: 26.67% Air Force)
* Coast Guard: 75.32% (Next highest: 12.99% I'd go back in time to punch myself in the face)
* Marine Corps: 58.33% (Next highest: 20.00% Air Force)
* Navy: 38.30% (Next highest: 26.60% Air Force)
* Space Force: 61.90% (Next highest: 19.05% Air Force)

So... if you didn't re-pick your same branch, you're likely to cross into the AF. Except if you're already AF or a Coastie, in which case you already know the truth, haha. Also, the Puddle Pirates are only willing to go into the CG, AF, or SF in that order. Zero were willing to cross into the blue, green, or red. When it comes to the Marines, they only branch they refuse to fuck with is the SF. The Navy refuses to join the Marines. And finally, the SF refuses to join the Army or Marines. Makes total sense, but I get a kick out of seeing the instinct we all have validated here.

Now, unless any of you have other questions or things you'd like to see from the data set I'm going to look away and try to get my eyes to stop bleeding.",t2_bdev9,False,,0,False,Military Subreddit Census 2023 Results,[],r/USMC,False,7.0,purple,0,,,False,t3_18u8lxz,False,dark,0.92,,public,11,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,11,,False,False,self,1703947442.0,,[],{},,True,,1703916222.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.USMC,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, ladies and gents, the results are in! While &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the results are viewable with the first link, questions that have user input instead of pre-defined answers are typically displayed very poorly in this view. Also, there&amp;#39;s no ability to filter any of the results to begin to compare branches or to analyze trends. That&amp;#39;s where this &lt;a href=""https://media0.giphy.com/media/A9KfKenpqNDfa/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e476jgwq0kipfh55xiwgtelrf3zfbytrdo1gktp7psh&amp;amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;amp;ct=g""&gt;fucking nerd&lt;/a&gt; comes in! The second link has some of my data breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When filtered by branch, a lot of the questions had trends that matched the overall answers. I didn&amp;#39;t spend time making separate graphs for those because it looks the same as all the answers combined. The branches match, the only difference is how many in each branch answered the question. Booooooooring. Without further ado, the results!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JxkwKNacCGXIs1Ys-1ppZGl75XFWDh4nsyYGlSbgBbs/viewanalytics""&gt;Military Subreddit Census 2023 Results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back from your research. Here&amp;#39;s the deal, I fully realize that this little &lt;del&gt;fetish&lt;/del&gt; census is flawed in several fashions. Here&amp;#39;s my shit list of all the ways I fucked this year&amp;#39;s census up. If any of you have suggestions for next year that I haven&amp;#39;t already discussed, hit up my inbox. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only noticed that I didn&amp;#39;t include a question asking which branch you&amp;#39;re a part of after 13 people already submitted answers. Fixed it live from my phone, but still.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My dumbass listed warrant ranks as CW-02 instead of CWO-2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I busted my own deadlines! Sinceriously sorry about that. I vastly overestimated my bandwidth and writing this up repeatedly fell to the bottom of the to do list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, now that I&amp;#39;ve taken some time to look a bit deeper than face value at all this data here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Basic Facts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y&amp;#39;all made 1,123 submissions. The ratio of branch submissions shaped how most questions were answered. In most charts, the disparity of answers per branch matched the disparity below. I only bothered making my own charts if I saw a trend that broke from this mold.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: 462&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Army: 258&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coast Guard: 85&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marine Corps: 69 &lt;sup&gt;nice&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navy: 107&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space Force: 70 &lt;sup&gt;tried too hard for nice&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blank: 72&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t make a chart for the question regarding your unit encouraging attending sick call or medical appointments, but I did notice something unique. The Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, and Space Force all increased in submissions as the likelihood of encouraging attendance increased from 1 to 5.

&lt;li&gt;You know, I think the one who listed &amp;#39;marriage&amp;#39; and another who listed &amp;#39;heavy spanking at home&amp;#39; should probably get together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than a couple of you got &amp;#39;your balls smoked off&amp;#39; or some variation like &amp;#39;Just had my ass smoked.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There I was in a Joint Command. Of all branches, Army is the only one that does not have a functioning SHARP or EO Program. Someone comes on the net on the watch floor that wanted to file a Sexual Harassment complaint. I had been trying for 6 months to get audience with the CDR with Stars on his chest to let him know about this deficiency, to no avail (because the lack of EO Program meant we didn‚Äôt have an Open Door Policy either, as noted by the Element CSM at the time who is now thankfully retired).

# Ego: ""I ain't hurtin' no one, so what's it matter?""

When the Marine starts to think the rules aren't beneficial, what others will be broken?

If you're showing your command and peers a lack of self-care, and self-discipline, then what are you gonna try to get away with when NO ONE is looking, hm? That's the worrisome part! That's why everyone's on your butt, man. Do ya get it?  This is a ""red flag"".

If you're lax on trimming on your own damn bushes then how lax are you gonna be clearing out those bushes obstructing your field of fire. If I was your TL, I'd be constantly concerned about you.

# Pride: ""I'm putting out more than them, I deserve a break""

When the Marine starts to think that he's too entitled to tuck his shirt in while he's working because it's hot and he's working on something big and important for the team. Maybe he just got back from a long 7 day mission and he just wants to sit in the chow hall with his gym shirt on. That tells me that you're not always gonna put out 100%. You know there's a time and place for a break, for a gym shirt, for R\&amp;R; but breaking protocols in front of a unit that's bonded on the structure and discipline and uniformity of it's men is not the time and or place. 

Remember the head shaving process, the issuance of the same uniforms for everyone? What about when 1 marine screwed up, do you remember your entire team getting punished along with you? You all lost that right to be a one man band when you joined the Corps! Now you're part of a corps, THE CORPS.

You've heard it said before, but do you really know what esprit de corps means?

It's the feeling of comradery, fellowship, unity and pride all felt by the same group.

But when the Marine starts to not follow the rules like everyone else, they start to etch away at that comradery. A cancer that eats it's own body must be stopped before it spreads

,bipolar,"I dont even know where to begin.

I (30M, Bipolar 1) came from a broken family. My parents (mum, especially) did well financially. She supported all her children needs but not me. Idk why. Maybe because she is ashamed that her son have a mental disorder. So i basically had to build my life from ground up myself. But its hard because i only have high school cert with no real life skills.

Life wasnt that good until i met my wife. She's awesome for accepting me for who i am. (Met her when i was having psychosis mania, but thats a story for another time.) Still broke af but at least i started to feel happy with life.

Long story short, i struggled financially for not being able to stick with a job. Worked min wage jobs, wife works too, helping to keep food on table. We lived in a ghetto but cheap apartment.

And fast forward years later

I finally managed to land a good job that i can finally stick to. (Low stress level and good pay). Before this, i could only work at a job for maximum 3-4 months.

And due to having that job, i managed to get 2 credit cards and due to have been working a stable job. I could apply for all type of loans. And most of it was approved.

So i started to buy cars, get a personal loan, moved to a better house. Life was finally good for a while. 

But when manic finally came after working for almost 2 years, i lost it all. I got fired.

That was the start of my downfall.

To keep on living, i had to max out my 2 credit cards. But that only lasted for few months.

I started to not being able to pay my rent and loans, and fast forward few months, the debt collectors keep fucking with me to get the payments. (Calling everyday, threaten with all kind of threats to get the money back). They are not loan sharks btw. Loan sharks are way worse.

Had to move far far away. To start a new life.

Now i live with my inlaws that hates me because i cant provide for my family. My mum hates me even more. I only have my wife and kid. And my wife are currently pregnant. We just found out.


Ive been thinking of declaring myself bankrupt because i have no capability to pay off all my loans.

Im in deepest depression episode of all my life. Rapid suicidal thoughts.

I feel so guilty towards my wife and kids. She is struggling so much to help me. I keep thinking she is better off without me. But thank god she still love me and understand my illness. I cant imagine life without her.

On the bright side, i got offered by a government agency to go for a skill bootcamp (electronics repair course), FOC, but i have to commit fulltime. I could only work part time during night if i need to. 

She's willing to let me go for the bootcamp (6months), to have a skill that could get me a good stable job again, hence, rebuild our life.

But we will struggle for 6 months.

Everyone else thought this is a stupid idea because a man should support the family, not my wife. And they may be right. Maybe this plan is plain stupid.

,bipolar,"So my friend and I met in a  psychiatric ward. We are both diagnosed with bipolar type 1. We have both been stable and on meds for the past couple of years. In the past few months she moved away from my city and told me she was going to quit one of her unde psychotic medications and would only stay on lithium.

 After that I started noticing her behavior was changing rapidly and becoming somewhat erratic. I am writing this because yesterday out of the blue she started talking to me about starting the new year with Jesus and saying very very religious things and quoting passages from the Bible and she has never done that before. She was never a very religious person. How she keeps telling me about how she needs to cleanse her sins and she also mentioned that she was possessed by a demon in her dreams.

We are both diagnosed with bipolar type 1. We have both been stable and on meds for the past couple of years. In the past few months she moved away from my city and told me she was going to quit one of her unde psychotic medications and would only stay on lithium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that I started noticing her behavior was changing rapidly and becoming somewhat erratic. I am writing this because yesterday out of the blue she started talking to me about starting the new year with Jesus and saying very very religious things and quoting passages from the Bible and she has never done that before. She was never a very religious person. How she keeps telling me about how she needs to cleanse her sins and she also mentioned that she was possessed by a demon in her dreams.

,bipolar,"So I‚Äôm diagnosed as BD II, but since my brother was diagnosed as schizoaffective I‚Äôm wondering if my first episode of depression was really psychosis. 

I could barely talk, I was convinced I was a demon, I was hallucinating on and off, and I would get so convinced a demon was behind me that I would be unable to turn around or look at reflective surfaces or be in a quiet room, stuff like that. I was not communicating most of this due to not being able to speak much, so my doctors at the time just thought I was depressed.

Most of that has happened semi frequently my whole life aside from the talking thing, just to lesser degrees or not all at once. By the time I was talking again I was so used to it that it didn‚Äôt seem worth mentioning. I found ways to deal with it. 

I‚Äôd been blaming the demon stuff on OCD, but in light of recently discovering I‚Äôve been hallucinating since I was a kid, I‚Äôm wondering if the other stuff is worth bringing up to my doctor.

Does any of that sound psychotic? I don‚Äôt want to overreact but I don‚Äôt want to underreact either. Would it change what treatment I‚Äôm doing if it was psychosis?

My neck likewise. The gums have a special atrocity. Itching with a sensation I can liken unto the warm fuzzy yet unwanted tingle elicited by the act of licking the end of a Double-A battery that only the hard strokes of the tip of my tongue can soothe.

I have to clean my room because Mama shouldn‚Äôt have to walk around my clutter. I eat because she‚Äôs eating. I groom myself because I saw how much grooming benefits my cat. I exercise because I know I‚Äôm my best self for her when I do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She‚Äôs exactly what I needed and im so grateful she chose me of all people&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"(Some edits made as requested)

Long post, but detail needed to explain my story.  (52 M) New to this group. Have been Bipolar 2 diagnosed since I was about 18.  I had trauma when my 15 year old brother was killed in an accident on vacation, which I‚Äôm sure also contributed to my issues.  Despite this, I‚Äôve been lucky enough to manage to hold down a well paying job, 16 years at my current employer. Was married 19 years, divorced as of 18 months ago, have two wonderful kids and we are all on very good terms. My ex even supports me emotionally and worries about me.

Two things that are major issues for me, becoming worse than ever now. First financial  -  despite earning $250k+, when married we always ended up way over spending. Some of it was also my ex‚Äôs fault, but when we divorced we were $100k in debt, just from credit cards. Luckily we had enough equity in our home to clear that. 

Now after buying my own home, 18 months later I‚Äôm almost $100k in debt again. Credit cards, $15k property tax bill I didn‚Äôt escrow, income tax bill, and embarrassed to admit money spent on girls - strip clubs, sex workers. That‚Äôs another story. Some of this was bad financial management, but much I would attribute to mania, spending on stuff like Hi-Fi gear, and the girls to alleviate my loneliness, difficulties with relationships, plus feeling the constant need for sex when manic.

Second, in the last month, I‚Äôve gotten into a sugar baby relationship. Found a girl on one of these sugar websites living locally who is a stunning 26 year old from Ukraine. Absolutely not a bimbo, she‚Äôs smart, and works as artist. She sugars to support herself and develop her business and art. Again the morality of the sugar lifestyle is another topic.  I believe there is very much a difference with a long term sugar relationship and a sex worker.

Two thoughts here that concern me. I‚Äôm developing feelings for this girl after a month and 6 dates.  She certainly enjoys being with me and finds me attractive - these girls can choose from 100s of guys on these sites. But of course she‚Äôs doing it for the money.  I know I‚Äôm being ridiculous but I can‚Äôt help but convince myself this could become a real relationship and long term.  I have challenges building and keeping romantic relationships - I fall in love quickly and generally scare people away.  The sugar baby thing means she sticks with me despite my faults.

Second huge issue is funding this sugar ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù to this girl. We agreed $3k a month for an exclusive relationship - no boyfriends, no other sugar daddies.  Yes sex is involved of course but also genuine date time together. But I‚Äôve already taken out a $17k 401(k) loan to fund 6 months with her, and as I say above currently getting a $100k heloc  of of my home equity to get me get clear of debt AGAIN.  Of course if I‚Äôm with her 6 months and more, I‚Äôll be in fully in love with her and nearing being financially ruined.

So a big mess. Just wanted to tell my story and see who can relate. Would welcome constructive advice and comments. Please don‚Äôt judge me for stupidity with money or morality of sex workers and sugar babies.   I‚Äôm on medication, have a great psychiatrist and new therapist, but haven‚Äôt as yet been brave enough to share the full extent of the financial side.

,bipolar,"39M, Argentinian living in Argentina

Diagnosed: mid 2019 during 1st and only hospitalization.

First symptoms looking back: Late 2016

Current meds:
Lithium
Lamotrigine 
Wellbutrin XP
Clonazepam
Olanzapine

I‚Äôve been having these 2 not urgent but persistent and life altering symptoms:

1. I can‚Äôt get up at the time I want in the morning. It‚Äôs as if there‚Äôs a force greater than me that doesn‚Äôt let me. Please don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôm just being lazy lol. It might be related to not wanting to confront my current job because I‚Äôm able to get up for other activities (therapies, on weekends, etc). Ideally I wake up several hours before my work starts (11am) and am able to go run some errand, run, gym, swim, go to a nice place for breakfast. I have no trouble sleeping and I‚Äôm not in a (hypo)manic state. I have no trouble identifying signs for those states and those are not the case.

2. I‚Äôm stable and balanced but I seem to have lost that ‚Äúlife-spark‚Äù that makes you want to create things, activities or any kind of new things. It‚Äôs as I‚Äôm existing only to respond to outside triggers (work requests, friend calls, medical suggestions). It‚Äôs not terrible but I have a little voice inside saying that I‚Äôm wasting my life away. I once believed this was related to Lithium. Tried leaving it for Lamotrigine (during the course of 1 month) and had strong paranoia episodes. So went back to Lithium.

Anyone having similar symptoms or advice?

So I'm diagnosed with Severe Major Depression but my psyc doctor is keeping an eye out for bipolar. Given my past history of being really depressed all the time, but also swings of what we both think is mania. I'm about 2 years out from telling anyone anything. That only happened because I fully lost my shit and no longer saw a way out. Someone stood between my firearms and me... and they called 911.

For the last 2 years I've been trying. For the 17 years before that (I'm 36) I was hiding everything. But I've been trying. I take my meds, I communicate with my doctor, I talk to my Significant Other. But everything is still just going down hill. The suicidal ideation are back and brought thoughts of self harm/ mutilation and homicidal ideations with it.

I feel that I am sick. I am only getting more sick. At some point someone is going to realize that I should not be allowed to work anymore.

I had trauma when my 15 year old brother was killed in an accident on vacation, which I‚Äôm sure also contributed to my issues.  Despite this, I‚Äôve been lucky enough to manage to hold down a well paying job, 16 years at my current employer. Was married 19 years, divorced as of 18 months ago, have two wonderful kids and we are all on very good terms. My ex even supports me emotionally and worries about me.

Two things that are major issues for me, becoming worse than ever now. First financial  -  despite earning $250k+, when married we always ended up way over spending. Some of it was also my ex‚Äôs fault, but when we divorced we were $100k in debt, just from credit cards. Luckily we had enough equity in our home to clear that. 

Now after buying my own home, 18 months later I‚Äôm almost $100k in debt again. Credit cards, $15k property tax bill I didn‚Äôt escrow, income tax bill, and embarrassed to admit money spent on girls - strip clubs, sex workers. That‚Äôs another story. Some of this was bad financial management, but much I would attribute to mania, spending on stuff like Hi-Fi gear, and the girls to alleviate my loneliness, difficulties with relationships, plus feeling the constant need for sex when manic.

Second, in the last month, I‚Äôve gotten into a sugar baby relationship. Found a girl on one of these sugar websites living locally who is a stunning 26 year old from Ukraine. Absolutely not a bimbo, she‚Äôs smart, and works as artist. She sugars to support herself and develop her business and art. Again the morality of the sugar lifestyle is another topic.  I believe there is very much a difference with a long term sugar relationship and a sex worker.

Two thoughts here that concern me. I‚Äôm developing feelings for this girl after a month and 6 dates.  She certainly enjoys being with me and finds me attractive - these girls can choose from 100s of guys on these sites. But of course she‚Äôs doing it for the money.  I know I‚Äôm being ridiculous but I can‚Äôt help but convince myself this could become a real relationship and long term.  I have challenges building and keeping romantic relationships - I fall in love quickly and generally scare people away.  The sugar baby thing means she sticks with me despite my faults.

Second huge issue is funding this sugar ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù to this girl. We agreed $3k a month for an exclusive relationship - no boyfriends, no other sugar daddies.  Yes sex is involved of course but also genuine date time together. But I‚Äôve already taken out a $17k 401(k) loan to fund 6 months with her, and as I say above currently getting a $100k heloc  of of my home equity to get me get clear of debt AGAIN.  Of course if I‚Äôm with her 6 months and more, I‚Äôll be in fully in love with her and nearing being financially ruined.

So a big mess. Just wanted to tell my story and see who can relate. Would welcome constructive advice and comments. Please don‚Äôt judge me for stupidity with money of morality of sex workers and sugar babies.   I‚Äôm on medication, have a great psychiatrist and new therapist, but haven‚Äôt as yet been brave enough to share the full extent of the financial side.

&lt;p&gt;My former friend would roll her eyes whenever I tried to describe my depression. When she witnessed me manic, she stopped talking to me completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was once told I was faking being suicidal and was only claiming it for attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, after describing a fight I had with my sibling where I explained I couldn‚Äôt help with my mom due to being suicidal, I was told I was weaponizing being suicidal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was told I could fix my mental health if I just fixed my diet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was told on a date that bipolar isn‚Äôt a mental illness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had potential dates quit talking to me after I opened up about my bipolar.&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"Hi all, want to share my experience in case it's useful to others (and it's just my experience, some have had it much worse, or different I know).

**DIAGNOSIS**

* One year ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar Type II.
* Key symptoms were a 15 year history of long bouts of depression (and anxiety, which I received a round of psychologist appointments for each time, roughly every 2 years coinciding with big life events/change), very serious plans to join the 27 club, and hypomanic episodes getting more frequent (cycling between depression and hypomania with no normwl time in between for 6 months+). Also, history of it in my family sealed the deal for the psychiatrist to diagnose me. This was all triggered by a massive change in my life and a loss.
* I was convinced I was coping alright throughout this whole time of acute struggle. I enjoyed hypomania, it was a nice release from the dullness of depression, I got super into hobbies and could deep clean everything, not need sleep, feel crazy energy, but it does get to a point of crisis by the end of a super saiyan week where my decisions got weird and I was a bit out of touch with reality, saying and doing whatever, then a dreaded comedown. Depression was awful of course, but it's not my first rodeo, and had enough strategies in place to wait it out. Note that I didn't really recognise hypomania at the time, I didn't know anything about BDII.
* Why I finally decided to seek help was not because I was cared about myself, but because I was losing my memory (lack of sleep related? I'll never really know) and was worried I would hurt someone else inadvertently. I was often losing focus in a big way while driving, just for 30 seconds going into a dreamlike state not knowing what I was doing or where I was - that's enough to drift into an innocent person coming the other way (and I live in a rural area so people are going 100km/h or 60mph, pretty much instant death if you crash). Worst memory fail was trying to fill out a form and not being able to recall my own name, lucky I had ID on me so I eventually remembered and got through it.

**TREATMENT**

* From a doctor's appointment to a psychiatrist to be available was 3 months.
* Two resources I found helpful in the first few months to learn about it all, were the free workbook from [CCI](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Bipolar) (a website I was recommended by a psychologist in my depression/anxiety era), and [Bipolar II Disorder Workbook](https://www.newharbinger.com/9781608827664/the-bipolar-ii-disorder-workbook/).
* Started mood tracking so I could accurately tell my psychiatrist what I needed. I started lamotrigine on daily 25mg, slowly increased to a daily 100mg - my mood stabilised on that amount so psychiatrist agreed I could keep on that unless something changed.
* I found the psychiatrist experience great - it was like all my struggles were acknowledged as real (idk, sometimes psychologists seemed to suggest that it was a thinking/attitude problem you could solve and it was frustrating) and he was just matter-of-fact and it was validating.
* Didn't feel the need to go back to a psychologist. Had a bad experience with my last attempt and I have a lot of helpful strategies from my last 5 or whatever. Talking about yourself is exhausting. Wouldn't recommend neglecting this side of treatment though, I am going to try again.

**OUTLOOK**

* I've still had a couple of hypomanic episodes this year, and a few bouts of depression - but they are way less severe and don't last as long as they used to, therefore it's much easier to maintain a normal-ish life. I've got a steady job again, and feeling more stable.
* Memory and focus have basically returned. I feel a bit dulled and slow to understand, only sometimes but it's nothing too noticeable. I write everything down.
* Told my immediate family, and one friend (who also shared another diagnosis with me, so it felt safe to share with her), and that's it. They're chill, don't think they really understand it and I've appeared high-functioning most of my life (mostly because I self-isolate whenever I have an episode, like a werewolf haha). I don't think I'll tell anyone outside of that group.
* Things I'm still struggling with ‚Äî accepting the diagnosis and reconciling it with my identity. Don't like the idea of taking a pill for the rest of my life. Feel a bit exhausted and hopeless thinking about the future, just experiencing this over and over. I also just don't want to be constantly aware of my mental health, it'd be nice just to not worry for a while.
* This year I'm going to find a good psychologist again, and request DBT instead of CBT (think I've got everything I can out of it). I *know* there's hope for the future, but I need to work out how to *feel* it. I also need to build up a better support network (how, I'm yet to work out), and get some healthy routines going, because you can feel like shit without that, even when you're not technically depressed.
* Things I've found helpful - keeping a daily record (3 memorable/grateful moments, and a mood rating; 1-7, 1 being dangerously depressed, 7 being dangerously manic, 3-5 being a normal range of moods), stream of thought journalling once or twice a week. Keep a simple list of easy things that improve your mood and tick what you managed to do each day.

&lt;li&gt;Started mood tracking so I could accurately tell my psychiatrist what I needed. I started lamotrigine on daily 25mg, slowly increased to a daily 100mg - my mood stabilised on that amount so psychiatrist agreed I could keep on that unless something changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found the psychiatrist experience great - it was like all my struggles were acknowledged as real (idk, sometimes psychologists seemed to suggest that it was a thinking/attitude problem you could solve and it was frustrating) and he was just matter-of-fact and it was validating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t feel the need to go back to a psychologist. Had a bad experience with my last attempt and I have a lot of helpful strategies from my last 5 or whatever. Talking about yourself is exhausting. Wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend neglecting this side of treatment though, I am going to try again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OUTLOOK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;ve still had a couple of hypomanic episodes this year, and a few bouts of depression - but they are way less severe and don&amp;#39;t last as long as they used to, therefore it&amp;#39;s much easier to maintain a normal-ish life. I&amp;#39;ve got a steady job again, and feeling more stable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory and focus have basically returned. I feel a bit dulled and slow to understand, only sometimes but it&amp;#39;s nothing too noticeable. I write everything down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Told my immediate family, and one friend (who also shared another diagnosis with me, so it felt safe to share with her), and that&amp;#39;s it. They&amp;#39;re chill, don&amp;#39;t think they really understand it and I&amp;#39;ve appeared high-functioning most of my life (mostly because I self-isolate whenever I have an episode, like a werewolf haha). I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll tell anyone outside of that group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things I&amp;#39;m still struggling with ‚Äî accepting the diagnosis and reconciling it with my identity. Don&amp;#39;t like the idea of taking a pill for the rest of my life. Feel a bit exhausted and hopeless thinking about the future, just experiencing this over and over. I also just don&amp;#39;t want to be constantly aware of my mental health, it&amp;#39;d be nice just to not worry for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year I&amp;#39;m going to find a good psychologist again, and request DBT instead of CBT (think I&amp;#39;ve got everything I can out of it). I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; there&amp;#39;s hope for the future, but I need to work out how to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; it. I also need to build up a better support network (how, I&amp;#39;m yet to work out), and get some healthy routines going, because you can feel like shit without that, even when you&amp;#39;re not technically depressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things I&amp;#39;ve found helpful - keeping a daily record (3 memorable/grateful moments, and a mood rating; 1-7, 1 being dangerously depressed, 7 being dangerously manic, 3-5 being a normal range of moods), stream of thought journalling once or twice a week. Keep a simple list of easy things that improve your mood and tick what you managed to do each day. Enjoy bipolar memes on Reddit, I don&amp;#39;t spend too much time on here if I can help it but have got lots of valuable info from here that has been really helpful to me - thank you all.&lt;/li&gt;

I'm here to ask something to you all. Last year i had my first manic episode and got diagnosed type one. Right now i lost the ability to sleep and is more than 24 hours that i'm awake and i don't feel the need to sleep, right now is 6 am so i'm waiting at least one more hour to call my psychiatrist.

Anyway, what i wanted to ask is, is it possible to have like an episode that doesn't feel like an episode? Like last time i went manic i had a big delusion about a some kind of God wanting to k*ll me and i had expansive mood but right now i just can't seem able to sleep and stay still but that's all.

I sent my psych a message but I likely won't receive a response until Tuesday or Wednesday because of the holiday and now I'm going so out of control that my husband even requested to not sleep next to me tonight because I'm draining the life out of him and idk what to do because I can't stop.

 I can't comprehend and process much of what's going on and I keep forgetting and I'm bouncing off the walls and made a huge decision to work in a career that was so bad for my mental health but I feel so confident that i can change it and excel at it and I keep dancing and singing and talking so so much and i don't realize that I keep doing things that make him feel so exhausted. He doesn't even want to talk to me and I feel so helpless and he says that I'm being too nutty for him rn and that I need to get myself under control and this is why he doesn't like when I try and add or change my meds because then he has to deal with this.

 I wish I could just stop but I can't and it makes me want to cry my eyes out but even if I did cry my eyes out I would still be too high. Please help. I need advice or support or words of encouragement, understanding... something bc I'm not getting it from him

Edit: he just called to apologize (I'm out rn) he says that we need to find a compromise during my episode but I'm not sure what kind of compromise I can do maybe if anyone has any ideas on how to meet someone in the middle when you're hypomanic that would also be super helpful

before i forgot to mention that both my grandma and mom do have bipolar 1, and so do I. ive never been in contact with them as i am adopted, so ive never learned much of them and how they worked with bipolar. all i know is my mom was addicted to opioids, when she gave birth to me.

Been here 

But it‚Äôs changed 

Not scared

Blanket on my eye lids

Rearrange my morals

Replace like a cork

From survive

Wanna have that cork explore the ceiling once more

Shake all that is a bore

Lie to get by

Been on rails that made me want to die

,bipolar,"Social isolation is the main star of all the manifestations of my depression. This time is taking so long and has ruined so many good things in my life. It's been 4 months of extreme social anxiety, that extends to my phone. I (24F) can't even read the texts my friends send bc then I'd have to realize how stupid depression makes me act. Everyone knows how I disappeared sometimes. But this time I got diagnosed. I know that's a good thing and I finally have have a chance with meds, but I'm just wallowing in my self isolating bubble coming to terms with everything I've done and trying to forgive myself. 

Since February I really believed I would never be depressed again, and this became a certainty over the following months. But this disease is at its core a masterclass of self sabotage. Icarus is the perfect metaphor.

It's agonizing remembering how I was thriving 6 months ago, on an academic level as well in relationships with friends and SO. The persona who's a social butterfly, out of my hometown, worker-student. My personality, confidence and strength are robbed from me every single time depression comes knocking on the door. My plans and hopes are washed away by the great tsunami of pain and doubt, once again. 

I just needed to vent a little bit. I've been stable but this afternoon just hit me how sad it is to be spending this night alone, because I don't have the energy to pretend everything is okay, until it is. 

I'll probably need to change meds. I'm on 100 sertraline and 50quetiapine (1st time). I need to figure out with my doctor if the quetiapine is dragging me down, bc sertraline/fluoxetine seem to  have worked faster in my previous episodes. I'm from Portugal so sorry about any mistakes. 

Happy New Year everyone - I'll end this with one of the most beautiful lyrics ever written 

*There been times that I thought*  
*I couldn't last for long*  
*But now, I think I'm able*  
*To carry on*

*It's been a long*  
*A long time coming, but I know*  
*A change gon' come*

This time is taking so long and has ruined so many good things in my life. It&amp;#39;s been 4 months of extreme social anxiety, that extends to my phone. I (24F) can&amp;#39;t even read the texts my friends send bc then I&amp;#39;d have to realize how stupid depression makes me act. Everyone knows how I disappeared sometimes. But this time I got diagnosed. I know that&amp;#39;s a good thing and I finally have have a chance with meds, but I&amp;#39;m just wallowing in my self isolating bubble coming to terms with everything I&amp;#39;ve done and trying to forgive myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February I really believed I would never be depressed again, and this became a certainty over the following months. But this disease is at its core a masterclass of self sabotage. Icarus is the perfect metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s agonizing remembering how I was thriving 6 months ago, on an academic level as well in relationships with friends and SO. The persona who&amp;#39;s a social butterfly, out of my hometown, worker-student. My personality, confidence and strength are robbed from me every single time depression comes knocking on the door. My plans and hopes are washed away by the great tsunami of pain and doubt, once again. &lt;/p&gt;

Even when my mum was dying my brother would still ask her for money.

I don't really want anything to do with him. My dad criticises me for this. My brother used to get angry when he didn't get his own way. He wouldn't take no for an answer when it came to money and he'd just hang around until someone handed him some cash. My father tells me to get on with him anyway, to forget the past and just get on with him, as if it was an even thing - as if I had created all the problems myself. My dad still insists I get on with him and am nice to him, almost positing me as an equal problem. Is this gaslighting? It is ok to want to cut him off?

My father and now deceased mother always used to cave in because they knew if they didn&amp;#39;t he might cause problems for them in terms of being in trouble with police.

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really want anything to do with him. My dad criticises me for this. My brother used to get angry when he didn&amp;#39;t get his own way. He wouldn&amp;#39;t take no for an answer when it came to money and he&amp;#39;d just hang around until someone handed him some cash. My father tells me to get on with him anyway, to forget the past and just get on with him, as if it was an even thing - as if I had created all the problems myself. My dad still insists I get on with him and am nice to him, almost positing me as an equal problem. Is this gaslighting? It is ok to want to cut him off? He&amp;#39;s done this for about 20 years - always been the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hello and Happy New Year !  


I want to shine a light related to alogia and how do I get better over time. It was a long time since I suffered from this (like 4 years) and I was thinking to post here in case someone want to hear my story of recovery.  


Before my illness I was a quite guy but not that quieter. I used to spoke in medium sentences using the right amount of speech (not much but not little either like I used to say with alogia).  My alogia was mild says the doctors because I wasn't used sounds to comunicate only speaking in a short sentences such as yes or not or sometimes asking few question.  


  
Now I'm pretty much recovered when it comes to Alogia since I spoke like I used to before somethimes even better. For those who still struggles with alogia give it times and I believe that you can recover too. I tried severals pills to do that along with my doctor and afterone month on Piracetam my speech and toughts appears from nowhere. So I believe it's related to chemistry in our schizophrenic brain even if experts arren't sure yet. If you watch Living Well With Schizophrenia channel, Laurel says she was struggling with alogia throught out period of her illness and she clearly made a recovery.

,schizophrenia,"(Diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar 2, suspected Autism)

Last night i missed my dose of abilify and i woke up at 6 am after an extremely off-putting dream. it felt very odd honestly and it gave very specific bad feeling.

After waking up, the room was very disorienting. Things kind of seemed 2D and the colors were very block-like. It felt like childhood sort of. I kept trying to shake the dream but very graphic flashes would keep popping up in my mind.

I then went to my bathroom and kept the lights open and played Tetris for a while since I saw a post on social media saying that playing it as long as possible after a traumatic event can lessen the impact and it sort of worked. The memory of the dream didn't really stay in my mind long-term.

I've been getting these sort of psychosis-like episodes more often lately even with the Abilify and I feel a little worried that it might be schizophrenia. Not that there's anything wrong with being diagnosed, but I do know it can be very debilitating.

Should I get myself checked? What next steps should I take? How do I lessen the frequency of having these episodes?

I find myself growing more and more paranoid that I'm losing my mind. What could be causing these sensations?

I'm specifically worried it may be schizophrenia since the ADHD and Bipolar symptoms can overlap.

,schizophrenia,"I had a lot of bursts of angriness, would have awful argument, being paranoid, and ended up losing tone of friends and losing family support. And then I would feel terribly humiliated and ashamed of being such an awful friend and human being. Some old friend even told me that I was the most self-untitled bitch she ever seen. This is what helped me the most to fight less and keep my friends.

**1st, it may be counterintuitive, but the first emotion you need to manage is not anger, it's shame.** Shame as an emotion is super toxic for your brain, and schizophrenic brain triggers an insane level of shame. Very few people talk about it, but shame is the emotion of schizophrenia, the same that sadness is the emotion of depression, and anxiety is the emotion of anxiety disorder. It means that it both aggravates your disease, AND is overproduced by your sick brain.

How to deal with shame, so that your brain can rest and produce less anger? Auto-compassion is the way to regulate shame. You can take a time for yourself, think about your experience of having all this shame and facing all these awful events and gives yourself the loving embrace a parent would give to a lost child. Tell yourself how much you understand that you are having a terrible time. You can hug a pillow against your chest while doing that, cry and imagining yourself as a child. If done properly, self-compassion can help you to move from shame and access guilt, which is a less toxic emotion and gives you the will to change. (Shame is more about wanting to hide and disappear, guilt is more about understanding you don't want to act not in accord with your values, and the truth is that you have great values, you don't want to have fight with your family and friends.) (Side note: shame can mutate in pride. It is super damaging for your relationship too. If you see yourself sliding in the ""I am superior"" mindset, take yourself back to self-compassion, acceptance and healthy guilt).

**2nd, how to regulate paranoia?** Paranoia is super tricky. I deal with it both with self-help stuff (like described here : [https://mind.help/topic/paranoia/coping/](https://mind.help/topic/paranoia/coping/)), direct communication (""I may be wrong, but I am afraid X, Y, Z is happening and it makes me feel angry and sad, I am right ?"") and by having some trustworthy people that are aware of my condition and help me to deal with people when I am paranoid. For example, I make my husband read my angry messages before sending them, he validates my anger and tells me when I am going too far. He is very good in non-violent communication and active listening, and de-escalate me when I am getting super angry against someone else. So, find the most emotionally intelligent person in your surroundings, be honest with them and ask them to call you out when you are getting paranoid. This is a difficult role. They must be super good in active listening, emotion validation, and boundaries setting.

**3rd, how to regulate anger?** Anger is an emotion that tell us that our space/boundaries is invaded. So, the easiest way to get it lower is to separate us physically from what makes us angry. If you feel you are too angry, just go away. Far. Far from the person, from your phone or computer if you are having online argument. Anger is also an emotion that is powerful and needs to be expressed. So write down how angry you are AND DONT SEND IT !!! It is only for your emotion to get out of your body. And also, last resort: the ""and then what ??"" game. Repeat yourself ""and then what ??"" until you don‚Äôt give a fuck about the situation. When you have done all of that, if still angry, examine if you need to express one boundary, and have the conversation in the nicest way possible.

**4th, how to repair?** A lot of people are not able to understand what we are going through, but some will and will accept our repair attempt. And know that in relationships, connecting after an argument is more important than not having arguments. Learn how to give proper apologies ([https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology) ). I lost many friends for ever at the beginning of my disease. But some family members that I have deeply hurt are now strong allies in my recovery. I also abandon the idea that everything is fixable. Some of my bad behaviors are not fixable, and I am ok with that. When I lose some friends, I go back to self-compassion and accept that my actions have consequences, even if caused by a terrible disease.

I still have anger issues, but less often, and life is getting easier as I progress in emotion regulation.

Here is what helped me,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18wni54,False,light,0.84,#ffd635,public,4,0,{},,f0f1c0ee-f18e-11eb-91bf-82cec2bd6a8e,False,[],,False,False,,{},Relationships ,False,4,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1704195656.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of bursts of angriness, would have awful argument, being paranoid, and ended up losing tone of friends and losing family support. And then I would feel terribly humiliated and ashamed of being such an awful friend and human being. Some old friend even told me that I was the most self-untitled bitch she ever seen. This is what helped me the most to fight less and keep my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st, it may be counterintuitive, but the first emotion you need to manage is not anger, it&amp;#39;s shame.&lt;/strong&gt; Shame as an emotion is super toxic for your brain, and schizophrenic brain triggers an insane level of shame. Very few people talk about it, but shame is the emotion of schizophrenia, the same that sadness is the emotion of depression, and anxiety is the emotion of anxiety disorder. It means that it both aggravates your disease, AND is overproduced by your sick brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to deal with shame, so that your brain can rest and produce less anger? Auto-compassion is the way to regulate shame. You can take a time for yourself, think about your experience of having all this shame and facing all these awful events and gives yourself the loving embrace a parent would give to a lost child. Tell yourself how much you understand that you are having a terrible time. You can hug a pillow against your chest while doing that, cry and imagining yourself as a child. If done properly, self-compassion can help you to move from shame and access guilt, which is a less toxic emotion and gives you the will to change. (Shame is more about wanting to hide and disappear, guilt is more about understanding you don&amp;#39;t want to act not in accord with your values, and the truth is that you have great values, you don&amp;#39;t want to have fight with your family and friends.) (Side note: shame can mutate in pride. It is super damaging for your relationship too. If you see yourself sliding in the &amp;quot;I am superior&amp;quot; mindset, take yourself back to self-compassion, acceptance and healthy guilt).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd, how to regulate paranoia?&lt;/strong&gt; Paranoia is super tricky. I deal with it both with self-help stuff (like described here : &lt;a href=""https://mind.help/topic/paranoia/coping/""&gt;https://mind.help/topic/paranoia/coping/&lt;/a&gt;), direct communication (&amp;quot;I may be wrong, but I am afraid X, Y, Z is happening and it makes me feel angry and sad, I am right ?&amp;quot;) and by having some trustworthy people that are aware of my condition and help me to deal with people when I am paranoid. For example, I make my husband read my angry messages before sending them, he validates my anger and tells me when I am going too far. He is very good in non-violent communication and active listening, and de-escalate me when I am getting super angry against someone else. So, find the most emotionally intelligent person in your surroundings, be honest with them and ask them to call you out when you are getting paranoid. This is a difficult role. They must be super good in active listening, emotion validation, and boundaries setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd, how to regulate anger?&lt;/strong&gt; Anger is an emotion that tell us that our space/boundaries is invaded. So, the easiest way to get it lower is to separate us physically from what makes us angry. If you feel you are too angry, just go away. Far. Far from the person, from your phone or computer if you are having online argument. Anger is also an emotion that is powerful and needs to be expressed. So write down how angry you are AND DONT SEND IT !!! It is only for your emotion to get out of your body. And also, last resort: the &amp;quot;and then what ??&amp;quot; game. Repeat yourself &amp;quot;and then what ??&amp;quot; until you don‚Äôt give a fuck about the situation. When you have done all of that, if still angry, examine if you need to express one boundary, and have the conversation in the nicest way possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4th, how to repair?&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people are not able to understand what we are going through, but some will and will accept our repair attempt. And know that in relationships, connecting after an argument is more important than not having arguments. Learn how to give proper apologies (&lt;a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology""&gt;https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology&lt;/a&gt; ). I lost many friends for ever at the beginning of my disease. But some family members that I have deeply hurt are now strong allies in my recovery. I also abandon the idea that everything is fixable. Some of my bad behaviors are not fixable, and I am ok with that. When I lose some friends, I go back to self-compassion and accept that my actions have consequences, even if caused by a terrible disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have anger issues, but less often, and life is getting easier as I progress in emotion regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

So I was formally diagnosed with schizoforum disorder when I was 15. In that time, I've had an almost rotating amount of Hallucinations - or, as my doctor and I have dubbed them, my ""Cast of Characters"" - that come and go as I've grown up (I'm 24 now). 

However, I'm worried that it makes me look like I'm faking, even though both doctor and therapist have told me that there is no way that I could be faking, because I meet everything needed to have a diagnosis in the first place. Especially because my hallucinations aren't just audible or visual - the visual matches the auditory, so when the hallucination talks, the voice matches the figure. 

I've always been self-conscious about it, because I know it sounds weird, but does anyone else have some experience with that? Anyone else's hallucinations more nice than mean?

I at the time had been for several weeks, deteriorating with my mental health and I reached a point where I needed to vent or I was going to explode. 


I left a voice memo telling them about how utterly ashamed I feel to have these types of problems (hallucinations + delusions) and, lamented about how lately I‚Äôve been insecure with the way I speak when we get to talk. Their reply made my heart totally drop. They commented that they noticed I‚Äôve been acting really out of it lately, and cited an example of them making a joke to me on the phone. They said I apparently got scared and took it ‚Äòreally seriously‚Äô which made them feel guilty for messing with me like that when it wasn‚Äôt their intention.

,schizophrenia,"Hi I am the little sibling of a brother who has recently developed schizophrenia.

Recently my brother had a delusion where he has no mental illness and doesn‚Äôt have schizophrenia. This is terrifying to me because he was recognizing he had it it felt like there was a chance we can move forward and try to get him medicated or at the very least allow him to use his schizophrenia to get on disability because he is currently living in aweful poverty in the other side of the country so I never get to see him physically and to let him ask my opinion on a delusion for reassurance (idk how much that would actually help but at the very least then I could know what‚Äôs going on because his situation is so horrible and I only have his words to go off of so it‚Äôs like my understanding of his life had the same schizophrenia filter on it. 

The only time I know for certain when he is telling me stuff that is a delusion is when it is text book like tearing off drywall looking for cameras, or him sending me a picture of something innocent and then sending a string of texts connecting that to a conspiracy while staring the the picture is of body bags when it is not.

When I am certain his delusions are false I don‚Äôt try to outright prove him wrong. I just want him to feel better and I am aware that when he takes a picture of a leaf and sees it as a dead body it is completely out of his control. My current understanding is that i don‚Äôt need to prove to him a delusion is false I don‚Äôt know like if that is even doable (please someone confirm or deny how possible to is to help a person with schizophrenia realize a delusion is false) but I assume it is incredibly difficult and often not worse because it risks agitating my brother, and would probably result in him justifying the delusion further cementing it in place.

Talking to my brother is very draining I haven‚Äôt spoken to him in the 4 years and I still live with my parents and he is on his own. I want to be able to talk to him about the stuff that goes on in his life so I know what‚Äôs going on but I never know when he is telling me about what‚Äôs happening in his life and his delusion (I don‚Äôt want him to avoid telling me about his delusions ever, they effect his mental state so much they are a part of his life and effect him just as much as his physical situation) but I dread conversations with him because I am very out of practice with talking to my brother the last time I did he didn‚Äôt have schizophrenia so I struggle to make conversation which results in him mostly venting, I am ok with him doing this I am ok with feeling a little drained after words it‚Äôs worth it to stay in touch and to give him a chance to vent and me to try and comfort, but I am scared by letting him vent I am hurting him more so this is something else I would like an opinion on. 

I just worry by letting him vent I am giving him more time space to allow the delusions to control his throughts which must not be good, but he also doesn‚Äôt have anyone else to talk to so he must need to vent a little bit I think it is good for him. But on the flip side I worry that having him talk about them to vent will only make them worse and stronger because when he vents about the effects his negative life situation + delusions he wants to give me context but to do so must elaborate, and I assume elaboration causes the delusions to become better thought out and more convincing.

So to make things less draining and scary every time I talk him I was thinking about outright telling him I don‚Äôt want to talk about whatever delusion that I have a decent understanding and don‚Äôt need him to talk more or when the delusion is just to big and scary and I worry talking about to will make it worse (I won‚Äôt say delusion because that would draw direct attention to it but I just will address the delusion and say I don‚Äôt want to talk about it). I assume this won‚Äôt work perfectly and he will try to continue especially if it‚Äôs very scary so I feel like if we drift back to talking about it I can tell him again I don‚Äôt want to talk about it to soften it maybe I could say I don‚Äôt want to talk about it but if it‚Äôs very important to you I can. I am ok with doing this but I want to know if this is too much of a push over thing to say that would result in him just always saying yes.

So tdlr; I am trying to help my little brother but I don‚Äô know the right things to do. Also I am worried I‚Äôm hurting more than helping because I am scared I can only say yes to him (part of that is because I pity him because it‚Äôs so unbelievably unfair he‚Äôs suffering and I‚Äôm not. So I want to sacrifice things for my self because I don‚Äôt have it as bad as him and I want to make up for the fact that life is unfair) finally I would like some perspectives on this from people who have experience with delusions. How do you feel when people either tell you that something is a delusion or when you try to talk to someone about it and they tell you they don‚Äôt want to hear it. I want him to vent if he needs too but I also want to tell him no sometimes. So can I get some thoughts on what could happen when I outright call out a delusion for being one in response to a hidden camera/wires in wall delusion for example.",t2_lgp56td6,False,,0,False,How would you feel if you were stressing over a delusion and trying to talk about it to someone and they said they didn‚Äôt want to talk about it?,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18w7b4f,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice / Encouragement,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1704144635.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi I am the little sibling of a brother who has recently developed schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So tdlr; I am trying to help my little brother but I don‚Äô know the right things to do. Also I am worried I‚Äôm hurting more than helping because I am scared I can only say yes to him (part of that is because I pity him because it‚Äôs so unbelievably unfair he‚Äôs suffering and I‚Äôm not. So I want to sacrifice things for my self because I don‚Äôt have it as bad as him and I want to make up for the fact that life is unfair) finally I would like some perspectives on this from people who have experience with delusions. How do you feel when people either tell you that something is a delusion or when you try to talk to someone about it and they tell you they don‚Äôt want to hear it. I want him to vent if he needs too but I also want to tell him no sometimes. So can I get some thoughts on what could happen when I outright call out a delusion for being one in response to a hidden camera/wires in wall delusion for example.&lt;/p&gt;

One of my biggest struggles is that I‚Äôm completely isolated. I live with family and I basically don‚Äôt leave the house or have a single IRL friend other than some people I haven‚Äôt seen/met up with in around 5-10 years.

People and social interactions terrify me. When I used to socialise I would become paranoid that they‚Äôre laughing at me or just pretending to enjoy spending time with me.

,schizophrenia,"Came across this subreddit while looking to learn more about experiences of being involuntarily hospitalized.

I‚Äôm losing my mind with my sibling (36M) who was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia a few years ago when he was also involuntarily hospitalized after getting arrested. He stopped taking his medication for over a year now and has been in a psychotic episode for five months. He lives with our very old mother and she‚Äôs his caretaker. There‚Äôs no one else but us two, our mother and me, to handle this, no one else who can intervene or talk to him. We have begged for months that he takes his medicine and he refuses completely. In those months, he has displayed really worrying behavior but hasn‚Äôt been violent against a person, and he occasionally threatens with violence. He held knives toward us once (but we knew he wouldn‚Äôt hurt us), a cutter to delivery guys, and smashed appliances around the house. He is also posting worrying stuff online, mainly threats to kill or wishes of harm against public figures.

We tried non-invasive ways of encouraging him to take his medicine, like withholding pocket money, but he is finding ways around that, mainly getting credit and accumulating a lot of debt, and also using these threats of violence to try and get money from us.

He finally opened up about what he thinks is happening and he def has delusions of self-grandeur and persecution.

After his first involuntary hospitalization he was traumatized and very resentful. He doesn‚Äôt acknowledge his illness at all. He held us accountable for hospitalizing him and he threatened many times of self harm or harming us if we hospitalize him, including before the first time.

,schizophrenia,"This last year I worked at a well known company but for only six months. It has been really hard to find the motivation. It was not due to stress. Also the contracted ended. So I have to make an effort again to find a new job.

&amp;#x200B;

I have lived with roommates before but my mother says there were problems. I did have two relapses within three years. I also lived in an apartment alone but like five minutes away from my parents.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a big city called Madrid in Spain away from family. I am living in a shared apartment as part of an association that has others with mental illnesses. It is transitional from dependent to independent living. So far I have gone one year and nine months without a relapse ever since I started this great medication for me, Latuda. I have been learning a very difficult language called Bulgarian and taking classes. Now I can have conversations in Bulgarian!

&amp;#x200B;

I go out every day. Walks and studying in the park. The chess club about once or twice a month for social activity.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is worried that I won't know how to handle the problems living with other roommates without supervision like from the association. But I did for three years already! But again she found problems with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I have to be perfect or something for my family to let me be independent. Also, two psychiatrist s told me that if I take my medication I can live a ""normal"" life. My mother is a psychologist. So she has experience with mental illnesses. But is she being too protective? If I can solve this motivation issue I could work continuously without breaks. I really made a huge effort last year and feel like it wasn't good enough. I wonder if anyone else has gone through something like this.

It has been really hard to find the motivation. It was not due to stress. Also the contracted ended. So I have to make an effort again to find a new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have lived with roommates before but my mother says there were problems. I did have two relapses within three years. I also lived in an apartment alone but like five minutes away from my parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in a big city called Madrid in Spain away from family. I am living in a shared apartment as part of an association that has others with mental illnesses. It is transitional from dependent to independent living. So far I have gone one year and nine months without a relapse ever since I started this great medication for me, Latuda. I have been learning a very difficult language called Bulgarian and taking classes. Now I can have conversations in Bulgarian!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go out every day. Walks and studying in the park. The chess club about once or twice a month for social activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother is worried that I won&amp;#39;t know how to handle the problems living with other roommates without supervision like from the association. But I did for three years already! But again she found problems with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I have to be perfect or something for my family to let me be independent. Also, two psychiatrist s told me that if I take my medication I can live a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; life. My mother is a psychologist. So she has experience with mental illnesses. But is she being too protective? If I can solve this motivation issue I could work continuously without breaks. I really made a huge effort last year and feel like it wasn&amp;#39;t good enough. I wonder if anyone else has gone through something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm new here. I was hospitalized since November 21st, 2023 until December 30th, 2023. 

I believed that I was hearing voices from Jesus and that he wanted me dead. When I was working retail, I began paying for customers groceries and acting strange. I stopped taking my medication and lied to everyone that I was still taking it. I stabbed myself with a knife. I almost killed my mom. 

In the hospital, I had ECT (electric compulsive treatment) which led me to forgetting what had happened when I was schizophrenic. We had a lot of group therapy sessions. It was extremely boring in the hospital and I hope I never have to go back again.

I‚Äôm actually still schizophrenic and still hear voices if I allowed myself to talk out loud. My mouth automatically moves on its own and words come out. My rectum also moves and has a voice of its own as well. Nowadays, I‚Äôm left extremely restless and can‚Äôt stop moving.

Leading up to this, I did marijuana, mushrooms, vaping, and certain drugs. I now know that I never wanna do marijuana again because I don‚Äôt want to trigger schizophrenia. I don‚Äôt wanna do drugs anymore either. 

Honestly, I just want to lead a normal life and get in a relationship with someone and be happy. I don‚Äôt want to do drugs anymore and I don‚Äôt want to have another schizophrenic episode. I don‚Äôt want to stress or endanger my parents. I don‚Äôt want to find out more about my schizophrenia by letting my mouth move on it‚Äôs own and talking in tongues.

\- integrated maths (high school basic course)

\- HTML/CSS, basic Javascript

 \- B2 English (Upper Intermediate)

\- maybe ancient history but not sure

What I definitely could not do is teaching in person because of poverty of speech (I only have it in real life, it seems) and getting weak when talking to the audience.

\- make a website with text courses in my native language with many exercises

\- contribute on Brainly

\- write a fiction/non fiction book

‚Äî

All my life; I have walked in the footsteps of ‚Äòtake me as I am or leave me alone‚Äô.
Why?
Such a question requires an honest answer.
Are you patient?
Such an answer requires enough time for us to enjoy a cup of coffee together while enjoying the ocean breeze.

‚Äî

It is true,
People do change or at least we all were blessed with ability to adapt.
In most cases, it is possible.
In some cases, it is nearly impossible.

People like me; AA or NA doesn‚Äôt exist.
People like me; support groups are not ‚Äòmagical cures‚Äô.
People like me; no amount of prayers, holy books, or scripture verses can silence the voices.

Schizophrenia is a fucking beast.
It is a savage animal that claws, bites, and stalks its prey.
It doesn‚Äôt retreat nor does it take ‚Äòbreaks‚Äô.
It is a 24/7 adrenaline junkie that seeks to wear down, torture, and confuse its prey.

We aren‚Äôt ‚Äòbroken‚Äô or ‚Äòcracked‚Äô screens that you can take to a mall shop to be fixed or replaced.
We aren‚Äôt ‚Äòprojects‚Äô that you can ‚Äòwork on‚Äô for extra credit.

‚Äî

I have seen,
I have experienced it.
My ex wife,
My adopted parents,
College buddies,
Past lovers and friends with benefits,
It didn‚Äôt matter what gender, skin color, or political beliefs they had;

In the past,
I flirted with both men and women,
In the past,
I ate pussy and sucked dick,
In the past,
I let girls and guys tie me up,
In the past,
I was stretched out by real dick and toys.
It didn‚Äôt matter how long we dated or how long we had been friends;

As soon as I became ‚Äònot useful‚Äô,
As soon as the ‚Äòfun‚Äô ended,
As soon as they were ‚Äòtired of me‚Äô,

I found myself alone in a room,
No one sitting across from me,
Both cups of coffee cold,
Behind me stood three ‚Äòevils‚Äô.
Behind me three ‚Äòbeasts‚Äô whispered in my ear;
‚ÄòDidn‚Äôt we tell you this would happen?‚Äô.

‚Äî

It didn‚Äôt matter if we both shared similar hobbies,
It didn‚Äôt matter how many things we had in common,
I was just a ‚Äòplay thing‚Äô.
I was just a ‚Äòfling‚Äô.

No matter how hard I tried to change,
No matter how medicated I was,
No matter how many times I attended therapy,

It never was enough.
Alex, Josephine, Bella, Caleb, Tyrone, Michelle, India, and Lily,
Kim, Charlie, Oscar, Fatima, Zeynab, Mohammed, and Clifton.

It took only one psychotic break.
It took only one episode of following a zombie Abraham Lincoln in a grocery store for all of them to pack their shit and leave without a note or even a text.

‚Äî

When I say,
‚ÄòJust as I am‚Äô,
What do you think it means?
Take your time,
Have a sip of coffee,
Think before you speak;
‚ÄúIt means take me as I am‚Äù.

‚Äî

Brief smile.
Sun‚Äôs reflection upon the sea.
You are correct.
I am unable to change who I am;
I am unable to build a TARDIS,

No matter how hard I try,
No doctor or surgeon can remove ‚Äòschizophrenia‚Äô from my brain.

I might be troubled.
I might be crazy.
I might not be able to provide ‚Äòeverything‚Äô someone wants;

What can I do?
I can provide laughter.
I can provide comfort.
I can provide unconditional love.

It is true,
I can‚Äôt provide ‚Äòpromises‚Äô or ‚Äòa boring life‚Äô.
If someone dares to stay instead of leaving in the middle of the night or early in the morning,

They will witness chaos.
They will witness ups and downs.
They will witness just how cruel ‚ÄòCharlie, Xavier, and Cassandra‚Äô can be,
They will witness an imperfect lover who dares to give everything they have left to whoever is willing to stay,

‚Äî

In the beginning,
I asked if you had enough time to enjoy a cup of coffee,
It seems that you kept your promise,
In this case,
Would you like to walk along the beach as a sign of friendship?

&lt;p&gt;‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my life; I have walked in the footsteps of ‚Äòtake me as I am or leave me alone‚Äô.
Why?
Such a question requires an honest answer.
Are you patient?
Such an answer requires enough time for us to enjoy a cup of coffee together while enjoying the ocean breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true,
People do change or at least we all were blessed with ability to adapt.
In most cases, it is possible.
In some cases, it is nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like me; AA or NA doesn‚Äôt exist.
People like me; support groups are not ‚Äòmagical cures‚Äô.
People like me; no amount of prayers, holy books, or scripture verses can silence the voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a fucking beast.
It is a savage animal that claws, bites, and stalks its prey.
It doesn‚Äôt retreat nor does it take ‚Äòbreaks‚Äô.
It is a 24/7 adrenaline junkie that seeks to wear down, torture, and confuse its prey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aren‚Äôt ‚Äòbroken‚Äô or ‚Äòcracked‚Äô screens that you can take to a mall shop to be fixed or replaced.
We aren‚Äôt ‚Äòprojects‚Äô that you can ‚Äòwork on‚Äô for extra credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen,
I have experienced it.
My ex wife,
My adopted parents,
College buddies,
Past lovers and friends with benefits,
It didn‚Äôt matter what gender, skin color, or political beliefs they had;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past,
I flirted with both men and women,
In the past,
I ate pussy and sucked dick,
In the past,
I let girls and guys tie me up,
In the past,
I was stretched out by real dick and toys.
