,Army,"If you haven’t heard, you no longer go to “My Absences” in IPPS-A to request leave. You go to “PAID” (Pay-Absences-Incent-Ded) to do that now. In some ways, the update actually seems better than the old system. But there’s a big flaw: you can no longer edit or delete any requests after you’ve submitted them. Here’s why that really sucks. 

My child was born last Thursday, so now I’ve gotta go in and request paternity leave so I can be home to help the wife out and be with my family. I unfortunately wasn’t able to get on IPPS-A on my phone or my computer on the hospital wifi (and there was no phone carrier service) and my wife and child weren’t discharged until Saturday. So we get home, I make a request, and go on with my day. Later on, I realize that I chose “birth of child” and not “non-birth parent” when requesting, which means I have to go in and change that. This is when I discovered that you can’t edit or delete requests anymore. Only the commander (hopefully) can. So I make a second request and explain the situation in the comments section of my new request. No big deal. 

Except now I realize that I’ve been requesting my leave to start on 03Jan, right after the 4-day. Uh-oh, I can’t do that, since the commander isn’t going to even see that request until 03Jan when we all return to work. I still have to report for duty that day since leave requested is not the same as leave approved. Realizing this, I go in to “edit” my request yet again, now for the third time. In comes our second major flaw in PAID. Since all three of my paternity leave requests would now exceed 84 days combined (84 is the max paternity leave dates allowed per birth/adoption/foster), my third request is not valid for submission. Now I get to email my commander explaining the whole situation and I feel like a tool for making all these mistakes back to back, but that’s what happens when your newborn destroys your sleep schedule. 

I don’t know if I’ll ever see the day when the military doesn’t give a contract to the lowest bidder, but it would be nice if we had a centralized system that wasn’t constantly full of coding errors.

,Army,"I'm at my first assignment where we have a heavy GS Employee presence within our organizations. Looking for advice on dealing with a shitty GS employee that's causing my team and supervisors headaches.

We had a really good GS Staff primary retire. His replacement, is not good. The guy is suave, charismatic, confident, and appears technically confident. Meanwhile, this hiree has no work ethic and continues to gets my team, who serves in the higher HQs, in trouble constantly. We've been tasked multiple times for either myself or my team to go down to his location to ""Catch him up on work"" for a recorded period of 54 calendar days and counting. 

Analyzing our help desk tickets for example, in the month of November, we had 271 help desk tickets come into our shop. 176 of those tickets came from his organization, or 65% for that months tickets. Out of those 176 tickets, 148 tickets or 84% of those tickets, were account activation and cell phone tickets. Out of my other organizations? They had requested for support for issues they couldn't do at their level, but overall, zero tickets for account activations and cell phone activations were sent by those six other organizations. The data for the other months more/less looks the same.

During one of our forced visits by my chain-of-command, our NCO discovered the new hire was committing time card fraud (unauthorized vacation), was late to work every day, and leaves early daily. I informed the person's leadership, who told to me to ""mind my own business"". HR was worthless too. They threw up their hands, told me that if the COC doesn't want to do anything about it, then they can't touch it. My leadership got scared, told me that time card fraud is a big deal, and left it alone. I tried IG and IG directed me back to HR, whose not doing anything about it.

The guy's actions are starting to impact my team's morale. We keep having to provide soldiers to ""catch him up"". My leadership is apathetic and doesn't see anything wrong with helping the guy out. Just recently, he got my XO in trouble at a meeting for failing to do a high visibility task. Everyone who has to work with this guy continues to complain, but it falls on deaf ears. The response continues to be, ""Do the job for the guy"". We are now at the point now where I can't go half a day without some sort of problem happening at his level that only my team can solve or do.

For context sake, it is not a replacement for TAP, VA, SkillBridge, or any other organization that helps you get skills/employment after you are out. It is not meant to be focused on any one service branch (although it might be Army heavy at the moment because that’s where I’m from). It is to address what the heck is going to happen to you as you get closer to getting out (regardless of reason, such as Medboard vs. retirement vs. not renewing your contract).

&lt;p&gt;For context sake, it is not a replacement for TAP, VA, SkillBridge, or any other organization that helps you get skills/employment after you are out. It is not meant to be focused on any one service branch (although it might be Army heavy at the moment because that’s where I’m from). It is to address what the heck is going to happen to you as you get closer to getting out (regardless of reason, such as Medboard vs. retirement vs. not renewing your contract).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It went live on 1 October. I’ve told probably about 100 other service-members and retirees. These are the stats as of 19
October:
Unique visitors: 214
Pageviews: 1,126
279 total visits from 16 countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it will always be free: no paywall and no subscription requirement. I’ll figure out later how to make money to support the site maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I post the link here? (I didn’t want to get coffee thrown in my face, lol).&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"Throw away account for obvious reasons..

I’m a 36 year old army wife and I have been married to my husband (33), for 2 years. In the last two years he’s been abusing steroids and me. When he’s not roid raging he’s a great guy. However now, he’s taking heavy Russian steroids and injecting a great amount every single day for weeks with no breaks.

We have a one year old daughter and I  am not currently working or have access to money as he has complete control. I can make a plan to leave but it won’t be easy and will take time to make it happen. 

I understand if we spilt hell still have legal rights to see my daughter and I don’t want her stuck alone with steroid freak as he can’t control his violence in front of her. 


I truly want him to get help and get off steroids since I can leave him but my daughter will still have to see him. He’s been on them 17 years straight no breaks other than for basic training. 

He always had a bad temper but who he’s become now with this insane dose he’s taking is absolutely terrifying. If I leave him while he’s still on them I’m scared he’ll come kill me. 

If I tell his command would he get kicked out or would they get him the help? 

I don’t want him kicked out because he’s the father of my child and he needs the job as he wasn’t successful doing anything else. 


But if I leave him before he gets help I’m scared he will come kill me or hurt me. I currently have so many random bruises from his freak outs. 

He said he wouldn’t get off steroids for any reason no matter what.

,Army,"Look, this isn’t easy for either of us. I recognize that now. But we can’t keep meeting like this, it’s just getting upsetting. 

I thought I made it clear almost a year ago. I tried to let you down easy, I really did. I felt like just saying “it’s not you, it’s me” and letting you go your own way would be fine. I thought you didn’t care anyways. But here we are. You keep texting, and calling, and even fucking emailing me. How the hell did you get my new email anyway? I don’t have your name in it anymore…

But fine, I’ll be frank. When we started, I truly loved you. Not like I had a choice really. In some weird oedipal complex you were all I knew, but I was never more proud than the day I was yours. We wore matching clothes. You and I said it would be forever. We had so much fun together through the years. God you could be so sexy…

I really saw myself growing old with you, which made what came next all the more painful

Because down the line, and I won’t name specifics because I don’t think it would even matter, I began to realize I was nothing to you, and nobody meant anything to you in general. I saw you use people up and spit them out. I saw you lie, cheat, and steal. I saw sides of you I thought I could get past; but I couldn’t. Then you fucked me over. Multiple times. Despite my willing devotion. I grew up that day maybe, or perhaps I was just finally honest with myself.

I didn’t love you anymore. I don’t love you anymore. I will never be with you again. We are through. I am sorry, but also not really.

,Army,"Lately, I have seen so many ""I want out"" or ""this shit sucks"" type posts and I just want to offer a bit of perspective.  

I have been in the Army for 24 years and I plan on retiring just shy of 26.  I have been AD enlisted, NG enlisted, and currently, I am an AD officer.  I've deployed three times to Afghanistan and I've PCS'd nine times, for context.  

My first duty station was Ft. Hood, pre-9/11.  This was well before smartphones and wifi became ubiquitous.  I thought my unit was pretty good, I made a lot of friends and had a lot of fun - even when it sucked.  Camaraderie was pretty high.  

From Hood, I went to Germany.  Germany was an absolute blast and I had an amazing three years there.  I absolutely hated my unit in Germany and my leadership.  I dreaded every day and only looked forward to the weekend.  I legit had a thought one day that if I could only break my arm, I'd not have to go to work today.  That's how much I hated going.  But I loved Germany, so it balanced in a way.  As much as it sucked at times, I never contemplated failing PT, HT/WT, or something else more drastic to simply get out.  I know a lot of you may feel like you need to consider these, but I implore you not to cut off your nose to spite your face - as the adage goes.  I joined for a shot at a better life, consider why you joined before you get drastic and while it may not register now - you may look back in 10 years and wish you stayed the course.  

I ETS'd from Germany and was heading to college to do ROTC.  I really disliked my unit and most of the leadership, but I also realized that whole grass is greener adage.  Overall, the Army was good to me.  I had one great unit and one bad unit, so I was 50/50.  Plus, college was always a goal of mine since I grew up poor and the Army was the only way I was going to get a college education.  That, and I was ETSing and heading to college at the time my HS friends were just graduating college, had debt, and didn't make much money.  I thought real hard about just doing school and remaining a civilian, but the Army itself, the pension, and a few other factors tipped me towards the Army as a career.   

In the end, going back to the Army as an O was a no-brainer - for me.  But for you, again, consider why you joined.   A great NCO once told me to never base your feelings about the Army on one duty station alone.  I don't know if this is still a thing - but how I got to Germany from Hood was by submitting a 4187 for re-assignment.  You used to be able to do this once you hit 12 months on station.  I'm not saying this will work for you, but it may be something to look into if you're not currently happy in your current unit.  

The Army has changed a bit in 24 years.  Society has changed a bit too.  The Army has some pervasive issues to work through as well.  But please, I implore you, do not resort to drastic measures simply to get out.  You truly never do know what unintended consequences those actions may have.  Take care of your health, both mental and physical, and even if the Army isn't fully for you - use this time to plan (and save money) for what you want your life to look like post-Army.

,Army,"Trying to become an officer at almost 35

Hi everyone. I am a male, 34 years old; I'll be turning 35 in a couple of months. I've had some familiarity with the military since an early age. My stepdad retired from the US Army as an E-8 in aviation. While we lived in the States, I was forced to join the JROTC (to gain some discipline at the time). I did it for a year, and after we moved abroad. I've been moving from place to place since then. I am looking at going back to the States and settling.

I hold a US Bachelor's degree in Philosophy and Psychology. And I have two Master's, both from a Spanish university online. One is in Education, and the other one in UX-Design. My GPA in all my degrees ranges from 2.4-2.8.

My career has developed mostly in language teaching. I am considering the option of becoming an officer either in the US Army or USAF. In the Army, I am a good fit for a Human Resources Officer, and in the USAF, I could potentially be an Intel Officer ( I did not find an HR officer on their website.

I am currently abroad, so I can't visit a recruiter. I am physically able to score 100 on the PT in both branches; however, I am approximately 30lb overweight for my age group. I'm 5'10'' with 220lb.

Also, I don't have any tattoos; however, I have a couple on my bucket list, and I might get them this year.

I would really appreciate any suggestions on how to approach this goal.

,Army,"Have you checked the HRC trends report for your MOS?  HRC periodically issues statistics not simply on the promotion point cut-off score for each MOS for promotion to SGT and SSG, but also publishes a look at the distribution of eligible soldiers by their current promotion points.  The attached chart is created from one of these HRC reports: SSG\_SGT-Eligibles-Trend-Report with the most recent being dated 4 DEC 2023.

In the chart, ranges of promotion points are shown on the horizontal axis (e.g. 24-49 points).  The bars represent a count of the SSG eligible soldiers and show the actual number above the bar.

If you are working towards promotion, this will give a clearer sense of where you stand relative to others in your MOS on promotion points.  Then you can strategize on ways to strengthen your position or to coach your soldiers.

As context using 11B, the SSG promo points cut-off for Oct, Nov, and Dec was 360, 357, and 396 points, respectively.  Also, in Dec 2023, there are 1220 SSG eligibles developing and moving towards promotion.  The average point score is 287 and average cut-off score over recent months is 365.

How does the distribution strike you?

Any feedback or insight would be greatly appreciated.

Can I get Ranger School after OSUT?

Hello, I am currently enlisting in the army national guard as an 11b. I’m curious if I could get ranger school after osut. I saw that one of the newer recruits got it and he went to ranger school, air assault school and airborne school straight after osut.

Getting ready to go see a recruiter for the Army, anything I should keep in mind.

Background, i’m 16, in highschool, and i’ve been very interested in the service my whole life. I’m not bad at school, my grades are very good and i’m in all advance classes. I’m considered a lot of things and a lot of options. Being an 18 series has been on the table for me, but i’ve also always been very into human ecology and more specifically the way humans interact with each other. So that led to me into checking out HUMINT. I don’t know much, pretty little actually and I’m planning to talk to a recruiter about all of this and just want to make sure I know what I need to know going into it. Thanks!

What's the deal w/ challenge coins? I see it spread to civ jobs too, with those coins to commemorate some event. Maybe it's just my nomadic situation talking with little space to spare but I'd rather have something I can use, even a tshirt lol, than something that won't have any use.

Im in high school right now and I have plans to join the military soon when I join 18. I been doing a lot of research since I know this is what I want to do and I am stuck on either trying to become a Ranger or enlist as a 35L (Counter Intelligence Agent). If you have served as either or have an opinion of which I should choose, please let me know because they both seem like good options in the long run.

I'm about to start my 6th week of basic training, and I love the Army so far. I'm looking to really protect and serve my country, but I fear I'll be recycled if I don't meet the Army standards for the upcoming 7-mile ruck we all have after HBL or if I don't pass the next ACFT. Even if I get recycled, as long as I do not quit, they won't kick me out, right?

I'll continue pushing. I don't know how long it takes, but I just worry they'll give up on me. I hear a lot of people say the Army doesn't care about you, and I refuse to believe in that. I just want to succeed in this.

Almost set on going 11X, I am overweight (25% BF) | need discipline, I plan to only do 4 years as 11 series to see if I enjoy it. What should I be expecting/looking to get out of it?
I heard people while I was at MEPs saying there doing their airborne physical, but to be honest I could care less if I was airborne or not, I am more interested in getting the discipline / benefits out of it etc. I mean arctic or mountain would be coool tabs.
Anyways, should I expect a bonus/airborne option? (never asked my recruiter about it cuz I figured I wasn't qualified due to weight)

It's no secret that 15W and 15E Shadow UAV community are about to be restructured and reorganized in a way that could mean reducing and reclassing many soldiers. I've seen several post for advice on forced reclassing pop up and think it would be beneficial for a stickied post to be created. Give the Shadow guys a place to discuss the future of the MOS along with advice on what to do going forward.

Also, any advice on being reclassed? How the process starts and about how many offerings they give? Asking for a friend...

I’m 17 and planning on joining the Army next summer. I’ll probably go talk to recruiters by January or February and just trying to make a decision. I’m mainly going into the Army for the experience not so much as a career unless I love my job. 11B and 12B both sound awesome but am worried I’ll regret it from what I hear from videos I’ve watched. I’ve heard of people not getting to do the job they signed up to do very often and get stuck doing shit details. For anyone who has been a 11B or 12B or currently is one do you recommend going that route or is it not really worth it over other MOS’s I could choose. Also interested in a realistic week of what each of these MOS’s do since most videos only show the best of what they do and not a realistic day to day. Appreciate anyone taking the time answering my questions!

(question starts in paragraph 2) Took the ASVAB and went to MEPS back in mid August, scored an 85, DQ for an old asthma diagnosis and antidepressant prescription from 2 years and 8 months ago at the time, quickly did what was asked of me to get waived, received the asthma waiver, because I don’t have asthma, then my recruiter was able to schedule the psych evaluation, backed up until mid January, fine, whatever, been waiting since then.

My question: is my recruiter bullshitting me? He has said since day one I can get airborne even with the waivers, I have not received an airborne physical, when I asked about it the recruiting station (commander? Chief?) said they would put in a special order for just the airborne physical at MEPS. I have no reason to question their promises, although while looking it up everyone I see asking about it is being told you cannot get an option 4 with any waivers, so I figured I would float my specific situation by y’all. the recruiter has said I won’t be able to sign opt. 40 or 18x with waivers, but that I should be fine for an opt. 4, and can volunteer for RASP at airborne. (I know I will be able to volunteer for RASP at airborne if I choose to, my question is just if I will be getting an option 4) the final seed of doubt in my mind was at my first go around at MEPS, when meeting with the guy who could print out a contract (if I didn’t need waivers and was G2G) said I couldn’t get airborne with waivers, when I brought this up to my recruiter after MEPS he said the guy must have been mistaken, or meant I couldn’t get airborne until I get my airborne physical, I have just been getting so much info saying “you CAN get an option 4”, then immediately someone else is telling me “You CANT get an option 4” As much as I would love to just take my recruiters word for everything, I wouldn’t be doing myself any favors by not seeking the opinion of people who don’t “get a number” whether I sign or not. Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks.

Should recruiters let you know when they’re on leave? I’ve been working with my recruiter for a while. We got to the part where he submitted my waiver and it got denied. He told me he will submit it again the same day I went to the office and would hear back by the end of the week. No word so I go back in later on and the boss guy told me he talked to his staff sergeant and that they’ll submit my waiver then. Did they not submit it the last time I went? Texting my guy to let me know when it’s submitted and the results and I got no response. Apparently he’s been on leave for a little over a week. I didn’t know, he just disappeared and they’ve been giving me the run around so I was under the assumption that they gave up on me.

What is AIT like?

I graduated BCT recently and will be reporting to Ft Gregg-Adams as a 91S soon, and was wondering what the AIR experience was like. I asked some of the DS's at Basic, but most of them gave pretty vague answers and said that it varies from base-to-base. Below will be a list of questions that I have. If you have the time, answers to any are appreciated. Thank you ahead of time. 

Will I go through reception again at AIT? If yes, will it be as thorough as BCT was, where they make you dump all your bags and check every item you bought? 

What is the living situation like? Will it be similar to basic where I'm in a bay with x amount of other personnel, have a room to myself, or be with just a few other bunkmates?

Following up living arrangements, am I able to bring my PS5 and monitor? Will I have enough personal time that it would even be worth bringing?

How does going off post work? Since I am not allowed a POV while in training, do I have to uber/lyft anywhere I need to go that isn't within walking distance?

I have a ton of questions, but I can't think of them on the spot right now, so maybe I will make another post later, but for now these are my main curiosities/concerns. Any input is appreciated, thank you in advance for your time.

Hi, when I enlisted into the National Guard, I took parts of a questionnaire that I found out was pre-filled when I did a background check for a TSA job application.

1.) Was it the SF-86 I was filling out before enlistment or was it something they use from it to gather relevant information pertaining to me?

There's a section on it that asks for foreign contacts and after swearing it, I find out that I'm in contact with a foreign national over social media which turned into a full blown relationship not too long after.

I come home from IET not even a day later and we ended things with each other but I have never been contacted by an investigator during my training and apparently obtained my security clearance while in BCT.

2.) Will I just have to contact my unit to let them know that I was in this relationship or will the information on the SF-86 for TSA suffice?

Prior service here, looking to go back into my original MOSs but it’s under precision retention so idk how that’s gonna go. 

My grade determination came back and it said I have to choose from 35F, 35G, 35P, 35T, and 88H to keep my grade. 

Anyone know how life is in those MOSs? What’s the day to day job like? What type of units would I be in?Trying to figure out what I should choose as a back up option.

Attempting to enlist in the Army as 11B, failed my hearing test twice as an H3 🤦‍♂️They didn’t clean my ears so I assume they didn’t see a reason to. From what I know, I don’t have hearing issues but clearly the test shows other wise. I can’t tell you the exact scores because I don’t remember, but I do remember that my lower frequency scores were within normal ranges, then as it progress to mid- high frequencies it got worse and pretty sure my highest frequency was at a 70 score. How likely am I to get a waiver for this? What will the process ensue? Will I be able to keep my MOS with this DQ? to be completely honest, I’m not even sure I did the hearing test correctly because I may have misunderstood the MEPS employee who only explained it once and I was severely deprived of sleep that day, should I mention that as a factor? I should also mention I have 0 problems communicating effectively in every day scenarios, I can hear someone having a private conversation from a closed room away.

I want to really know how the army culture is, like I know how most guys are and I can handle all the jokes and I can enjoy a few of them but I really wonder if there is anything that I have to worry about or any red flags that I have to pay attention to if I join. My family has told me to make sure to keep my eyes and ears open, but I was wondering if I need to take more caution.  The mos that I want to join is like a 13m

I had my option 40 contract taken because I got to meps and they said that I needed a waiver for astigmatism in my eye. I went back for a second time with a regular infantry contract and then they told me I cant go infantry because my eyes were not corrected to 20/20. I ended up signing a 19d cav scout contract because they were telling me i could still join the regiment as a cav scout but after researching I realized you can't. What would I have to do to join the ranger regiment? Could I just get eye surgery when I get out of bootcamp and switch to infantry? How quickly could I switch my mos? I signed for 3 years.

I’m 17 and my mom is making me join the military. I know technically I don’t have to, but I have to live with her and she’s my legal guardian, and she’s a terrifying person. I have too. She wanted me to join the Air Force but I guess they weren’t getting back to her when she was trying to correspond with them because I ended up talking to an army recruiter. I’m going to meps tommorow and after medical she wants me to refuse to swear. I don’t know about the “permanentness” (for lack of better words) of swearing at meps and if that makes it set that I have to join the army, but she’ll get upset if I swear anyways. Who would I tell and when that im not swearing. I’m trying to avoid awkwardness and kind of do it as smooth as possible, I have no idea what I’m walking into tommorow and Thursday.  
(I also have a bad cold right now, I can work through life and stuff fine, but my nose is inflamed and congested asf, and I heard the meps doctors are strict. Will I probably not swear anyways orrrr?)

Hi everyone, 

I'm about to join the Army (obviously) and I really need some help picking an MOS. I scored a 95 on my ASVAB and have every possible job I could want which, tbh is a little overwhelming. I'm currently fixed on 25B and 37F as they I have personal interests in both and believe they allow for fantastic opportunities outside of the military. My main goal is to get an MOS I like and has useful skills in the civilian world, gain experience and familiarity with the military, and then submit a packet for SFAS. I don't want to join as an 18X because I personally want to advantage of some of the scholastic benefits I have access to while active duty. I would really love to hear some experience from guys in 25B or 37F but also just guys who are active and like their MOS or retired guys who found great success in the civilian world due to the experience they gained in their MOS. 

For added context I am 26, not kids, never married, and serving in the military has always been a goal of mine and I want to milk my benefits and come out as best I possibly can on the other side. 

Thanks in advance.

I failed 2 hearing test twice at MEPS. Does anyone know how exactly it’s performed? If I hear a series of 3 beeps in a row, do I push the button once at the first beep or do I press the button 3 times in a row?

Hello everyone,

This one is probably asked a lot but here it goes. So right now I’m 24 pushing 25 and have done  two office jobs and was terrible at both of them. I’ve always wanted to be in the military but am curious about the office work load that officers get. Are you constantly doing paper work as an officer in the army if so should I consider being enlisted since I was pretty bad at being at my office jobs and would succeed better outside working hands on instead of being at a computer.

I have a buddy who’s looking to join with me. He’s just worried about his genital psoriasis. He said it doesn’t bother him at all and it’s just a few red marks. He was never diagnosed by a doctor for it but he’s worried when he would go through MEPs a doctor would see it and disqualify him. What are your thoughts? Thank you in advance for the help.

I am currently a dep for 17E which I will be shipping out in sep of 2024 but as im looking more into 35t I feel like this mos could provide me with better opportunities after my contract. Any input on which mos would be better?

I’m a prior service Marine switching to army. For MOS’s I was offered either 13B or 19K. I’d like to do the full 20 and make a career out of the military. Which MOS would I have an easier/better career in? I know I’m stupid but I’m interested in both MOS’s. Completely aware most soldiers in 13B or 19K hate their lives. From my research it seems that 13B has the better duty stations and more duty stations to choose from and I’d have a better chance of going to schools like airborne or air assault. For 19K I found being a tanker slightly more interesting and I heard the promotions are really fast. Any advice would be appreciated. I’m being very indecisive.

What are the Female Physical Requirements?

I’m enlisting into the army very soon and I wanted to know what all females have to go through during basic training. My cousin is also in the army however, he is a male in infantry so I know that females don’t necessarily do as much as males. My mos will be a 42A but I would like to know the physical requirements for BCT so therefore I can prep myself such as “rucking”, deadlifts, planks, push-ups, etc. Do/can females do knee-push-ups or full out push-ups? Also how long would I be rucking in duration of miles &amp; estimated amount of weight. I will also be in Fort Jackson, SC if that helps as well. I’m new to all this so I just wanna come as prepared as possible.

Wanted to join the infantry since I was young and I feel like it I don't then I'll regret it. I want to stay in for 20 years and make it my career. Am I dreaming or is this realistic if I really want it? 11b airborne. Active duty.

&lt;p&gt;Can I get Ranger School after OSUT?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, I am currently enlisting in the army national guard as an 11b. I’m curious if I could get ranger school after osut. I saw that one of the newer recruits got it and he went to ranger school, air assault school and airborne school straight after osut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting ready to go see a recruiter for the Army, anything I should keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background, i’m 16, in highschool, and i’ve been very interested in the service my whole life. I’m not bad at school, my grades are very good and i’m in all advance classes. I’m considered a lot of things and a lot of options. Being an 18 series has been on the table for me, but i’ve also always been very into human ecology and more specifically the way humans interact with each other. So that led to me into checking out HUMINT. I don’t know much, pretty little actually and I’m planning to talk to a recruiter about all of this and just want to make sure I know what I need to know going into it. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the deal w/ challenge coins? I see it spread to civ jobs too, with those coins to commemorate some event. Maybe it&amp;#39;s just my nomadic situation talking with little space to spare but I&amp;#39;d rather have something I can use, even a tshirt lol, than something that won&amp;#39;t have any use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im in high school right now and I have plans to join the military soon when I join 18. I been doing a lot of research since I know this is what I want to do and I am stuck on either trying to become a Ranger or enlist as a 35L (Counter Intelligence Agent). If you have served as either or have an opinion of which I should choose, please let me know because they both seem like good options in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long could someone be out of the army, decide to come back, and retain their rank and not have to complete basic training again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m about to start my 6th week of basic training, and I love the Army so far. I&amp;#39;m looking to really protect and serve my country, but I fear I&amp;#39;ll be recycled if I don&amp;#39;t meet the Army standards for the upcoming 7-mile ruck we all have after HBL or if I don&amp;#39;t pass the next ACFT. Even if I get recycled, as long as I do not quit, they won&amp;#39;t kick me out, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll continue pushing. I don&amp;#39;t know how long it takes, but I just worry they&amp;#39;ll give up on me. I hear a lot of people say the Army doesn&amp;#39;t care about you, and I refuse to believe in that. I just want to succeed in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ways to earn extra money while enlisted?  Could I work overtime or volunteer for extra drills to get more drill pay?  Do field exercises pay more? Would I have time to get a local job or maybe do some online work/side hustle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I will be stationed overseas in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost set on going 11X, I am overweight (25% BF) | need discipline, I plan to only do 4 years as 11 series to see if I enjoy it. What should I be expecting/looking to get out of it?
I heard people while I was at MEPs saying there doing their airborne physical, but to be honest I could care less if I was airborne or not, I am more interested in getting the discipline / benefits out of it etc. I mean arctic or mountain would be coool tabs.
Anyways, should I expect a bonus/airborne option? (never asked my recruiter about it cuz I figured I wasn&amp;#39;t qualified due to weight)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no secret that 15W and 15E Shadow UAV community are about to be restructured and reorganized in a way that could mean reducing and reclassing many soldiers. I&amp;#39;ve seen several post for advice on forced reclassing pop up and think it would be beneficial for a stickied post to be created. Give the Shadow guys a place to discuss the future of the MOS along with advice on what to do going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, any advice on being reclassed? How the process starts and about how many offerings they give? Asking for a friend...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 17 and planning on joining the Army next summer. I’ll probably go talk to recruiters by January or February and just trying to make a decision. I’m mainly going into the Army for the experience not so much as a career unless I love my job. 11B and 12B both sound awesome but am worried I’ll regret it from what I hear from videos I’ve watched. I’ve heard of people not getting to do the job they signed up to do very often and get stuck doing shit details. For anyone who has been a 11B or 12B or currently is one do you recommend going that route or is it not really worth it over other MOS’s I could choose. Also interested in a realistic week of what each of these MOS’s do since most videos only show the best of what they do and not a realistic day to day. Appreciate anyone taking the time answering my questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I scored 90 on asvab and my recruiter and family saying not go to infantry. My recruiter trying to push nurse but I’m not joining the army to be a fucking nurse. 5,10 155 pretty fit. Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/army/comments/18fr4sq/weekly_question_thread_12112023_to_12172023/kd21ald/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to Comment Chain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(question starts in paragraph 2) Took the ASVAB and went to MEPS back in mid August, scored an 85, DQ for an old asthma diagnosis and antidepressant prescription from 2 years and 8 months ago at the time, quickly did what was asked of me to get waived, received the asthma waiver, because I don’t have asthma, then my recruiter was able to schedule the psych evaluation, backed up until mid January, fine, whatever, been waiting since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question: is my recruiter bullshitting me? He has said since day one I can get airborne even with the waivers, I have not received an airborne physical, when I asked about it the recruiting station (commander? Chief?) said they would put in a special order for just the airborne physical at MEPS. I have no reason to question their promises, although while looking it up everyone I see asking about it is being told you cannot get an option 4 with any waivers, so I figured I would float my specific situation by y’all. the recruiter has said I won’t be able to sign opt. 40 or 18x with waivers, but that I should be fine for an opt. 4, and can volunteer for RASP at airborne. (I know I will be able to volunteer for RASP at airborne if I choose to, my question is just if I will be getting an option 4) the final seed of doubt in my mind was at my first go around at MEPS, when meeting with the guy who could print out a contract (if I didn’t need waivers and was G2G) said I couldn’t get airborne with waivers, when I brought this up to my recruiter after MEPS he said the guy must have been mistaken, or meant I couldn’t get airborne until I get my airborne physical, I have just been getting so much info saying “you CAN get an option 4”, then immediately someone else is telling me “You CANT get an option 4” As much as I would love to just take my recruiters word for everything, I wouldn’t be doing myself any favors by not seeking the opinion of people who don’t “get a number” whether I sign or not. Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family is putting together a shadowbox to commemorate my dad&amp;#39;s service, and we were struggling to find what a specific unit pact should look like. Are there any dedicated resources that might provide pictures of what to look for and from what years?

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should recruiters let you know when they’re on leave? I’ve been working with my recruiter for a while. We got to the part where he submitted my waiver and it got denied. He told me he will submit it again the same day I went to the office and would hear back by the end of the week. No word so I go back in later on and the boss guy told me he talked to his staff sergeant and that they’ll submit my waiver then. Did they not submit it the last time I went? Texting my guy to let me know when it’s submitted and the results and I got no response. Apparently he’s been on leave for a little over a week. I didn’t know, he just disappeared and they’ve been giving me the run around so I was under the assumption that they gave up on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is AIT like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated BCT recently and will be reporting to Ft Gregg-Adams as a 91S soon, and was wondering what the AIR experience was like. I asked some of the DS&amp;#39;s at Basic, but most of them gave pretty vague answers and said that it varies from base-to-base. Below will be a list of questions that I have. If you have the time, answers to any are appreciated. Thank you ahead of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I go through reception again at AIT? If yes, will it be as thorough as BCT was, where they make you dump all your bags and check every item you bought? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the living situation like? Will it be similar to basic where I&amp;#39;m in a bay with x amount of other personnel, have a room to myself, or be with just a few other bunkmates?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following up living arrangements, am I able to bring my PS5 and monitor? Will I have enough personal time that it would even be worth bringing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does going off post work? Since I am not allowed a POV while in training, do I have to uber/lyft anywhere I need to go that isn&amp;#39;t within walking distance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a ton of questions, but I can&amp;#39;t think of them on the spot right now, so maybe I will make another post later, but for now these are my main curiosities/concerns. Any input is appreciated, thank you in advance for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, when I enlisted into the National Guard, I took parts of a questionnaire that I found out was pre-filled when I did a background check for a TSA job application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Was it the SF-86 I was filling out before enlistment or was it something they use from it to gather relevant information pertaining to me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a section on it that asks for foreign contacts and after swearing it, I find out that I&amp;#39;m in contact with a foreign national over social media which turned into a full blown relationship not too long after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come home from IET not even a day later and we ended things with each other but I have never been contacted by an investigator during my training and apparently obtained my security clearance while in BCT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Will I just have to contact my unit to let them know that I was in this relationship or will the information on the SF-86 for TSA suffice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jobs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior service here, looking to go back into my original MOSs but it’s under precision retention so idk how that’s gonna go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grade determination came back and it said I have to choose from 35F, 35G, 35P, 35T, and 88H to keep my grade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone know how life is in those MOSs? What’s the day to day job like? What type of units would I be in?Trying to figure out what I should choose as a back up option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m in Basic on HBL. Is there any way I can check my military email? I have a CAC and CAC reader. I also have access to a navy base nearby if I need to use their computer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help would be appreciated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempting to enlist in the Army as 11B, failed my hearing test twice as an H3 🤦‍♂️They didn’t clean my ears so I assume they didn’t see a reason to. From what I know, I don’t have hearing issues but clearly the test shows other wise. I can’t tell you the exact scores because I don’t remember, but I do remember that my lower frequency scores were within normal ranges, then as it progress to mid- high frequencies it got worse and pretty sure my highest frequency was at a 70 score. How likely am I to get a waiver for this? What will the process ensue? Will I be able to keep my MOS with this DQ? to be completely honest, I’m not even sure I did the hearing test correctly because I may have misunderstood the MEPS employee who only explained it once and I was severely deprived of sleep that day, should I mention that as a factor? I should also mention I have 0 problems communicating effectively in every day scenarios, I can hear someone having a private conversation from a closed room away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a 17 yr old girl who is thinking about joining the army because I like the values and the structure, plus I like to get my hands dirty but as I was reading through reddit comments I see a lot of men who advise against women joining. I want to really know how the army culture is, like I know how most guys are and I can handle all the jokes and I can enjoy a few of them but I really wonder if there is anything that I have to worry about or any red flags that I have to pay attention to if I join. My family has told me to make sure to keep my eyes and ears open, but I was wondering if I need to take more caution.  The mos that I want to join is like a 13m&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a criminal history with no charges and some hand tattoos how likely is it to get multiple waivers approved as 32 yr old male? just began talking with a recruiter today and he said he did not want to give me false hope but he would be talking to his boss and be in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had my option 40 contract taken because I got to meps and they said that I needed a waiver for astigmatism in my eye. I went back for a second time with a regular infantry contract and then they told me I cant go infantry because my eyes were not corrected to 20/20. I ended up signing a 19d cav scout contract because they were telling me i could still join the regiment as a cav scout but after researching I realized you can&amp;#39;t. What would I have to do to join the ranger regiment? Could I just get eye surgery when I get out of bootcamp and switch to infantry? How quickly could I switch my mos? I signed for 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context I’ve been playing sports since I was 4 literally been able to pass every physical test was a top athlete in my state… back in 2018 they ran one on me saying it was abnormal my recruiter ran my records saying I have to get another ekg went to the doctor and yet again it was abnormal so she referred me to a cardiologist, I just hope this doesn’t get in my way of enlisting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 17 and my mom is making me join the military. I know technically I don’t have to, but I have to live with her and she’s my legal guardian, and she’s a terrifying person. I have too. She wanted me to join the Air Force but I guess they weren’t getting back to her when she was trying to correspond with them because I ended up talking to an army recruiter. I’m going to meps tommorow and after medical she wants me to refuse to swear. I don’t know about the “permanentness” (for lack of better words) of swearing at meps and if that makes it set that I have to join the army, but she’ll get upset if I swear anyways. Who would I tell and when that im not swearing. I’m trying to avoid awkwardness and kind of do it as smooth as possible, I have no idea what I’m walking into tommorow and Thursday.&lt;br/&gt;
(I also have a bad cold right now, I can work through life and stuff fine, but my nose is inflamed and congested asf, and I heard the meps doctors are strict. Will I probably not swear anyways orrrr?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m about to join the Army (obviously) and I really need some help picking an MOS. I scored a 95 on my ASVAB and have every possible job I could want which, tbh is a little overwhelming. I&amp;#39;m currently fixed on 25B and 37F as they I have personal interests in both and believe they allow for fantastic opportunities outside of the military. My main goal is to get an MOS I like and has useful skills in the civilian world, gain experience and familiarity with the military, and then submit a packet for SFAS. I don&amp;#39;t want to join as an 18X because I personally want to advantage of some of the scholastic benefits I have access to while active duty. I would really love to hear some experience from guys in 25B or 37F but also just guys who are active and like their MOS or retired guys who found great success in the civilian world due to the experience they gained in their MOS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For added context I am 26, not kids, never married, and serving in the military has always been a goal of mine and I want to milk my benefits and come out as best I possibly can on the other side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I failed 2 hearing test twice at MEPS. Does anyone know how exactly it’s performed? If I hear a series of 3 beeps in a row, do I push the button once at the first beep or do I press the button 3 times in a row? I need to know if I failed due to my own negligence or because I genuinely have hearing issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is probably asked a lot but here it goes. So right now I’m 24 pushing 25 and have done  two office jobs and was terrible at both of them. I’ve always wanted to be in the military but am curious about the office work load that officers get. Are you constantly doing paper work as an officer in the army if so should I consider being enlisted since I was pretty bad at being at my office jobs and would succeed better outside working hands on instead of being at a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a buddy who’s looking to join with me. He’s just worried about his genital psoriasis. He said it doesn’t bother him at all and it’s just a few red marks. He was never diagnosed by a doctor for it but he’s worried when he would go through MEPs a doctor would see it and disqualify him. What are your thoughts? Thank you in advance for the help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently a dep for 17E which I will be shipping out in sep of 2024 but as im looking more into 35t I feel like this mos could provide me with better opportunities after my contract. Any input on which mos would be better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a prior service Marine switching to army. For MOS’s I was offered either 13B or 19K. I’d like to do the full 20 and make a career out of the military. Which MOS would I have an easier/better career in? I know I’m stupid but I’m interested in both MOS’s. Completely aware most soldiers in 13B or 19K hate their lives. From my research it seems that 13B has the better duty stations and more duty stations to choose from and I’d have a better chance of going to schools like airborne or air assault. For 19K I found being a tanker slightly more interesting and I heard the promotions are really fast. Any advice would be appreciated. I’m being very indecisive.&lt;/p&gt;

My cousin is also in the army however, he is a male in infantry so I know that females don’t necessarily do as much as males. My mos will be a 42A but I would like to know the physical requirements for BCT so therefore I can prep myself such as “rucking”, deadlifts, planks, push-ups, etc. Do/can females do knee-push-ups or full out push-ups? Also how long would I be rucking in duration of miles &amp;amp; estimated amount of weight. I will also be in Fort Jackson, SC if that helps as well. I’m new to all this so I just wanna come as prepared as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"Firstly, sorry but this is going to be a long one. I (22m) am a 91L who joined the army a year ago because I thought I had no better way of getting the experience I needed to work on the equipment I wanted to work on. I went to a tech college and got an associates in Diesel and Heavy Equipment Technology, and I absolutely love working on equipment, but I hate basically every other aspect of the army. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve met some of the greatest people I’ve ever known here, but that alone is not proving enough to make me feel like this is worth it. I reconnected with a girl I was friends with from all the way back in middle school through high school, but lost contact with for the years between graduation, college, and me moving to Texas for the army. I’ve had a crush on her since middle school, apparently she has too, and we chose to get together while talking over the phone back in august. This holiday block leave was the first time I’d seen her since high school, and leaving her has got to be the absolute hardest thing I’ve ever done. For the first time in my life, it feels like I finally have someone that loves me as I am, not like how my parents do, but by their own choice.  I’m sitting in my barracks room right now writing this, feeling like absolute dogshit and depressed as all hell because I don’t rightly know when I’m going to see her again apart from the rough idea of next holiday block leave. I hate not being near her, I hate being so far away from her and everyone else I know (I’m from NC) and I don’t rightly know what to do at this point because if I could get out then I absolutely would. But between the bonus the army gave me for the contract, my car payment, and the uncertainty of getting a job in the field I want without being scrutinized for leaving the army early, I don’t know what to do. Part of me just wants to bury myself in working so I stop thinking about it but I don’t want to do that because I hated how it made me feel prior to getting back in touch with my girlfriend. I hate pretending I’m something I’m not with saying everything will be okay and I’ll just push through the army. I hate making myself be something I’m not just so I don’t let down the people around me because I can’t fucking run worth shit so the fucking acft is always a struggle for me.

,USMC,"(I will spare you all pics of my ripped, tight, 57 year old body and just give the advice)

**Getting Fit: An Overview**

**Four levers to pull:**

**Training**: this is where you force adaptations in your body to get stronger, gain endurance, etc.

**Nutrition**: this is where you fuel that magnificent beast of a body and lose fat

**Activity**: this is where you stop dying early and help burn calories

**Sleep**: this helps your body recover and benefit from the other levers

**Training**: Try and get in at least one session a week of those four kinds of training:

* *Strength*: this could be barbells or machines at a gym, or pushups, pullups, and air squats at home. It could be Pilates or power yoga—anything where you are doing sets of movement that push your muscles. Don’t stress over particular programs, set/reps, etc. If you do 3-5 “hard sets” (like maybe you had another 1-2 movements in you), for basic movements like squatting down/picking things up, pushing away, pulling towards, lunging forward/sideways, and twisting, you will get stronger.
* *Cardio/Zone 2:* jogging, rucking, powewalking, biking, etc. Half an hour at a moderate pace, like 60-70% of your max heart rate (220-age). Don’t go too hard or you miss the benefit! This is your base of your endurance.
* *Metabolic/HIIT*: bursts of activity that are close to maximal: skipping rope, elliptical, sprinting, etc. The goal is to get your heartrate up very high for working sets, with active recovery in between. I like 30 seconds work/1:30 active recovery. You could do 1 minute on/1 minute recovery, etc. But something like an 8-9 on a scale of 1-10 for work, and then drop to a 5-6 for the recovery period.
* *Mobility*: just go to youtube and find a 20-30 minute routine you like (Julia Reppel and Tom Morrison are good).

**Nutrition**: This can be overwhelming, and in a culture where we are surrounded by tons of crappy food. Some manageable suggestions:

Focus on getting in good food. When you eat high quality food, you will be less likely to eat crap. Also, good fuel will help you train, recover, and improve your body.

*Eat whole foods instead of processed foods; cook as much as you can instead of take-out*. Think of Panera and McDonalds as poison dispensaries; fruit juice, granola bars, breakfast cereals, store-bought muffins, breads, and cakes are all pretty much posion. Poison, poison, poison. Replacing poison with nuts, drinking milk, searing proteins like fish and chicken, eggs, cheese, broccoli/Brussel sprouts/cabbage, etc. is a huge move in the right direction.

*Don’t kid yourself*: it doesn’t matter what some calorie counter/TDEE website says. Over the course of a week, scales aren’t informative, but over the course of months they are. If you are not gaining muscle and want to, add a small portion of food daily. If you are not losing fat and to, cut out a small portion of food daily. Reassess every two weeks and cut/add as needed.

*Cut out some obvious crap*: empty-calorie drinks like soda or caramel-frappalacho iced vente w/ extra pump+cream, potatoe chips/fries, ice-cream, etc. Set a boundary you can follow, e.g. you will have 2-scoops of ice cream once on the weekend, a peppermint latte w/ extra sprinkles. The important thing is to identify something clear you can cut out to reduce calories in (assuming you want to loose fat)—“eat less” will never work, but cutting out the mid-AM hostess snack cake daily will.

*If you drink alcohol, consider setting clear bounds to reduce consumption*, e.g. if you have a couple beers most nights, set a clear rule that you will only have 3 beers total Fri-Sat.

**Activity**: very simply, a sedentary lifestyle is deadly. Every hour you spend on the couch watching Netflix chips away at your life and health, while every hour walking/gardening/doing chores/playing with your kids is life-extending/improving. Find a way to move more often: go for a 30 min walk after dinner.

**Sleep:** Find a way to get in sleep: a cool room, no lights, calm before you go to bed, no using the bed for anything other than sleeping (and makin’ whoopee), regular bedtime—whatever it takes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Fit: An Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four levers to pull:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;: this is where you force adaptations in your body to get stronger, gain endurance, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;: this is where you fuel that magnificent beast of a body and lose fat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activity&lt;/strong&gt;: this is where you stop dying early and help burn calories&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;: this helps your body recover and benefit from the other levers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;: Try and get in at least one session a week of those four kinds of training:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strength&lt;/em&gt;: this could be barbells or machines at a gym, or pushups, pullups, and air squats at home. It could be Pilates or power yoga—anything where you are doing sets of movement that push your muscles. Don’t stress over particular programs, set/reps, etc. If you do 3-5 “hard sets” (like maybe you had another 1-2 movements in you), for basic movements like squatting down/picking things up, pushing away, pulling towards, lunging forward/sideways, and twisting, you will get stronger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cardio/Zone 2:&lt;/em&gt; jogging, rucking, powewalking, biking, etc. Half an hour at a moderate pace, like 60-70% of your max heart rate (220-age). Don’t go too hard or you miss the benefit! This is your base of your endurance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metabolic/HIIT&lt;/em&gt;: bursts of activity that are close to maximal: skipping rope, elliptical, sprinting, etc. The goal is to get your heartrate up very high for working sets, with active recovery in between. I like 30 seconds work/1:30 active recovery. You could do 1 minute on/1 minute recovery, etc. But something like an 8-9 on a scale of 1-10 for work, and then drop to a 5-6 for the recovery period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mobility&lt;/em&gt;: just go to youtube and find a 20-30 minute routine you like (Julia Reppel and Tom Morrison are good).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;: This can be overwhelming, and in a culture where we are surrounded by tons of crappy food. Some manageable suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on getting in good food. When you eat high quality food, you will be less likely to eat crap. Also, good fuel will help you train, recover, and improve your body.&lt;/p&gt;

,USMC,"First I understand that its a privilege but hear me out.


Essentially I am transitioning &amp; got a offer to take a 120 day skill bridge internship with General Dynamics.   The only issue is that I have 87 days of leave on the book and the program goes for 120 days. It would start in April &amp; end August 1st my final day of my contract. 

My direct SNCO wants me to be able to use it because he truly thinks that my current unit doesn’t need me as I am not used for anything but the rest of my Chain isn’t too much on board because they want me to “Train my replacement” who would arrive after the start date. Im in one of those units in which we honestly have Marines for the sake of having Marines.  Like that one commander that doesn’t use his Marines but will never admit it because he enjoys the idea of having extras on standby.

Here is where I have a issue.

1. The command I am apart of is Top heavy and as you know in Top Heavy commands Sergeants don’t do much.
2. If I go on skill bridge the command won’t approve my leave and there reasoning for is that Im supposed to use my leave dates for skillbridge which I know is false &amp; their stubbornest will make me have to sell 80+ days when I dont do anything at all.
3.  The Average work day is from 0800 - 1500 and I am serious.  It is literally a ghost town come 1430/1500. On top of that I don’t even do anything. Seriously I spend 90% of the day on youtube because my job is just misc stuff they don’t want to do like organizing files.  It usually two meetings day then every one goes home.
4.  I find it hard to think that they can’t afford to lose but others in the shop can go TAD for sports games.


How should I go about doing this.

A Marine made a few untimely decisions (how many times have you heard a story start like that) got in a loud argument with his wife in a public place, and got himself 3 hots and a cot for a while - next court date is January 8th. He is also facing four felony counts as the result of him hitting his van (wife and kids were in the van) with his truck. 
Wife is not pressing charges. She never wanted him arrested. 

He knows his actions are his responsibility and knows too that he done fucked up. This is his 1st negative interaction with local law enforcement. He was arrested and charged with: four felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill; three misdemeanor counts of child abuse; one count of communicating threats; and one count of hit and run failing to report property damage.

Wife is not pressing charges. She never wanted him arrested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He knows his actions are his responsibility and knows too that he done fucked up. This is his 1st negative interaction with local law enforcement. He was arrested and charged with: four felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill; three misdemeanor counts of child abuse; one count of communicating threats; and one count of hit and run failing to report property damage. 
He is being held in the county Jail on a $500,000 secured bond and is scheduled to appear in court Jan. 8.&lt;/p&gt;

Coming from a 6 year reservist. I dont care what bullshit you have against reservists or the current marine corps. What keeps you guys going, is the spirit. The spirit to keep it together to do your thing. Whatever it is. 

But tonight, we celebrate. Another year gone by. I love the corps. For its marines,  Its history, and their ability to adapt and overcome. I hope I’m not the only one.

Well tonight, I just wanted to say, I hope you are all safe, comfortable, and with good company. Nothing better than a group of leathernecks and go getters. The world is expecting. Hold your own and keep it together right?

I’m here for you. I can’t help but know there are some of you here tonight looking for a voice. Something to read. I’ve been there. I love you guys and girls. You’re doing what needs to be done, but with little gratitudes…marines don’t need gratitude. We know we’re good to go. But it takes a lot to admit that we do need some camaraderie. 

Too all you killers out there, I hope your in good spirits, good health, and good company. Don’t neglect. Do yourself something no one else would do. Hit the gym. Hit the chow hall. Go out with the group. Be kind and hit hard when it counts.

If yalls plan is to distract commands and have their attention at 1443 go ahead and assume some initial success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink responsibly so those on duty  tomorrow don&amp;#39;t have a worse night than already being on duty. One of the said memes (from DD214memes) for yalls time, can&amp;#39;t imagine if there is actually a Cpl Hyde and how many calls they will be getting but that person is a meme in and of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

,USMC,"Not sure if the picture helps but is there a way you can tell if the Inactive Duty Points ""NonPaid"" (-it shows the number 4 second row down) relate to Disability Income taken in lieu of ""drill pay""?  We've run into this before YEARS ago-forgot about the $100/month disability he was receiving but he was also Active reserves  collecting drill payments and we had to write a check for almost $4000 to   
 reimburse because they continued VA payments throughout the years.

He was rated 100% disabled end of 2019- and I think we ran into this again. 

He was an 0-6 with 28 years of service. Is there a way someone can look at thisandcan calculate:

,bipolar,"DISCLAIMER : I’m not getting of bipolar medication, I’m coming off of Ativan, which was prescribed to me at a low dose for sleeping.

Thanks to our *awesome* health care system, my doctor has been backed up for WEEKS on filling prescriptions - which means I’m about to run out of Ativan and I have no refills remaining. The only option I have is to slowly take myself off of it, but I’ve definitely been dealing with insomnia/disturbed sleep. 

Last time I was medically assisted in discontinuing a medication, I was told to take it every other day (example: Monday = take before bed, Tuesday = don’t take before bed, etc.) until I was used to not being on it. It’s been helping for now, and I’ve been using melatonin as a replacement, but I definitely won’t have enough to continue this within the next couple days. 

I understand that this is not really the best option, but given my circumstances, it’s really the only one I have.

,bipolar,"Tl;dr — I believe I’ve been unknowingly experiencing hallucinations my whole life that have been induced by extreme anxiety, grief, and trauma.

I’m going to apologize in advance because this is going to be super long. I (28 F) have had bipolar II ever since I was a kid, but wasn’t formally diagnosed until a few years ago. Both of my parents have BD II and I share the same symptoms and tendencies, even as a young child. From the ages of 6 through 12, I only slept maybe 3-4 hours per night (which I believe may have been a 6-year chronic mania episode — not totally sure). Every night I would see figures in the dark and hear things that obviously weren’t there (like people walking up and down the hallway all night / seeing dark shadows and figures beside my bed). Being a kid, I believed in monsters and ghosts, so I thought those were what were keeping me up at night. I remember being so full of fear and anxiety my whole childhood about hearing and seeing things at night. I obviously grew out of that, but would still hear and see strange things. I kind of ignored it and just chalked it up to my eyes playing tricks, and would  also convince myself that I didn’t actually hear anything. I lived with my grandparents due to the severe consequences of my parents’ bipolar episodes, and when I tried talking to them about it, but they never believed me. Once I turned 17, the sounds and figures went away. However, they briefly appeared again when my mom passed away in a car accident. I saw my mom standing in my kitchen once, and occasionally heard her voice. My mom’s death was extremely traumatic, so I had gotten into some new age stuff at that time to cope, and convinced myself that maybe it was her spirit or something. The sights and sounds of her stopped, and I lost interest in spirituality. 

Fast forward to a week ago — I realized I was dipping into a full blown mixed episode. I’ve been trying to ride it out, but it seemed to be getting worse. I got into a pretty serious argument with my boyfriend New Year’s night, and we are currently on the verge of breaking up. and have been in a panicked state with severe anxiety. I have some trauma from abandonment, so this is causing me an unbearable amount of anxiety, panic, and stress. As you all know, BD makes it difficult to be in a healthy relationship, and a lot of us end up alone because of it. 

Last night I started seeing shadows that were similar to what I saw as a kid. And this morning as I was laying in bed, I saw a man standing in my bedroom. He disappeared after about 10 seconds, which felt like the longest 10 seconds of my life. I got the same feelings of anxiety and fear as I did when I was a kid.

I started reading things online, and realized that my bipolar episode, coupled with my overwhelming anxiety, may be causing hallucinations. I’ve been thinking about my experiences when I was a kid, and I’m starting to think that I’ve been experiencing hallucinations my whole life. I know now that bipolar disorder can cause hallucinations, especially coupled with extreme fear, anxiety, and trauma (this wasn’t something I was aware of until today). I guess I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? Like hallucinations due to anxiety and or old feelings resurfacing from previous trauma? I’m going to address this with my doctor, but some advice on how to manage would also be great. I’m afraid I’m going to have hallucinations that last for years again. I’m also not going to rule out the possibility of schizophrenia. I’m currently on 150mg of Lamotrigine, so maybe I need to increase my dose.

The NHS is so overburdened that I can’t see the rate of decline being picked up on, and instead I’m only contacted when I show clinical thyroid or kidney issues, and I’d rather avoid reaching that point.

I also have a significant family history of thyroid issues (including a grandparent who died as a result of them - although I get this is unlikely for me, but still an extreme case scenario).

,bipolar,"I dont even know where to begin.

I (30M, Bipolar 1) came from a broken family. My parents (mum, especially) did well financially. She supported all her children needs but not me. Idk why. Maybe because she is ashamed that her son have a mental disorder. So i basically had to build my life from ground up myself. But its hard because i only have high school cert with no real life skills.

Life wasnt that good until i met my wife. She's awesome for accepting me for who i am. (Met her when i was having psychosis mania, but thats a story for another time.) Still broke af but at least i started to feel happy with life.

Long story short, i struggled financially for not being able to stick with a job. Worked min wage jobs, wife works too, helping to keep food on table. We lived in a ghetto but cheap apartment.

And fast forward years later

I finally managed to land a good job that i can finally stick to. (Low stress level and good pay). Before this, i could only work at a job for maximum 3-4 months.

And due to having that job, i managed to get 2 credit cards and due to have been working a stable job. I could apply for all type of loans. And most of it was approved.

So i started to buy cars, get a personal loan, moved to a better house. Life was finally good for a while. 

But when manic finally came after working for almost 2 years, i lost it all. I got fired.

That was the start of my downfall.

To keep on living, i had to max out my 2 credit cards. But that only lasted for few months.

I started to not being able to pay my rent and loans, and fast forward few months, the debt collectors keep fucking with me to get the payments. (Calling everyday, threaten with all kind of threats to get the money back). They are not loan sharks btw. Loan sharks are way worse.

Had to move far far away. To start a new life.

Now i live with my inlaws that hates me because i cant provide for my family. My mum hates me even more. I only have my wife and kid. And my wife are currently pregnant. We just found out.


Ive been thinking of declaring myself bankrupt because i have no capability to pay off all my loans.

Im in deepest depression episode of all my life. Rapid suicidal thoughts.

I feel so guilty towards my wife and kids. She is struggling so much to help me. I keep thinking she is better off without me. But thank god she still love me and understand my illness. I cant imagine life without her.

On the bright side, i got offered by a government agency to go for a skill bootcamp (electronics repair course), FOC, but i have to commit fulltime. I could only work part time during night if i need to. 

She's willing to let me go for the bootcamp (6months), to have a skill that could get me a good stable job again, hence, rebuild our life.

But we will struggle for 6 months.

Everyone else thought this is a stupid idea because a man should support the family, not my wife. And they may be right. Maybe this plan is plain stupid.

I could barely talk, I was convinced I was a demon, I was hallucinating on and off, and I would get so convinced a demon was behind me that I would be unable to turn around or look at reflective surfaces or be in a quiet room, stuff like that.

Most of that has happened semi frequently my whole life aside from the talking thing, just to lesser degrees or not all at once. By the time I was talking again I was so used to it that it didn’t seem worth mentioning. I found ways to deal with it. 

I’d been blaming the demon stuff on OCD, but in light of recently discovering I’ve been hallucinating since I was a kid, I’m wondering if the other stuff is worth bringing up to my doctor.

It honest to god felt like I was communicating with another entity when I was going through it but afterwards it seems so ridiculous. It genuinely felt so real in the moment and it seemed like more than a coincidence, I would ask it questions and it would answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if this would be considered a symptom of delusions or a delusional disorder? Has anyone else had similar symptoms when they went through their manic phase? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this also something that can be exacerbated  or brought about by stress? I was going through an extremely stressful situation at the time and I haven’t gone through something like this before.&lt;/p&gt;

Meds are working great but I get to where I feel like I should go into a depression. 
I don’t really have any issues. I have a great job, no financial issues, and a great family but I still find myself struggling.

,bipolar,"Hi all, I highly recommend reading, “Bipolar General: My Forever War with Mental Illness” - Gregg F. Martin.

Retired Major General Gregg F. Martin shares his battle with bipolar disorder and his new mission to combat stigma! 

Gregg Martin is a 36-year Army combat veteran, retired 2-star general, and bipolar survivor, thriver, and warrior. In 2003, Martin commanded a combat engineer brigade during the Iraq war, and the intense stress of combat triggered the genetic predisposition for bipolar and sent him into his first manic episode.

 After his deployment, he fell into depression, marking his first up-down cycle. For a decade, these swings of mania and depression continued, going undetected, undiagnosed, and unknown by him or anyone around him. It wasn’t until 2014, during an episode of acute mania, that he was removed from his role as President at the National Defense University and began receiving help. With treatment and support from his family, friends, and an in-patient stay at the VA Hospital, Martin has found a new mission in combatting mental health stigma to save lives.

,bipolar,"(Some edits made as requested)

Long post, but detail needed to explain my story.  (52 M) New to this group. Have been Bipolar 2 diagnosed since I was about 18.  I had trauma when my 15 year old brother was killed in an accident on vacation, which I’m sure also contributed to my issues.  Despite this, I’ve been lucky enough to manage to hold down a well paying job, 16 years at my current employer. Was married 19 years, divorced as of 18 months ago, have two wonderful kids and we are all on very good terms. My ex even supports me emotionally and worries about me.

Two things that are major issues for me, becoming worse than ever now. First financial  -  despite earning $250k+, when married we always ended up way over spending. Some of it was also my ex’s fault, but when we divorced we were $100k in debt, just from credit cards. Luckily we had enough equity in our home to clear that. 

Now after buying my own home, 18 months later I’m almost $100k in debt again. Credit cards, $15k property tax bill I didn’t escrow, income tax bill, and embarrassed to admit money spent on girls - strip clubs, sex workers. That’s another story. Some of this was bad financial management, but much I would attribute to mania, spending on stuff like Hi-Fi gear, and the girls to alleviate my loneliness, difficulties with relationships, plus feeling the constant need for sex when manic.

Second, in the last month, I’ve gotten into a sugar baby relationship. Found a girl on one of these sugar websites living locally who is a stunning 26 year old from Ukraine. Absolutely not a bimbo, she’s smart, and works as artist. She sugars to support herself and develop her business and art. Again the morality of the sugar lifestyle is another topic.  I believe there is very much a difference with a long term sugar relationship and a sex worker.

Two thoughts here that concern me. I’m developing feelings for this girl after a month and 6 dates.  She certainly enjoys being with me and finds me attractive - these girls can choose from 100s of guys on these sites. But of course she’s doing it for the money.  I know I’m being ridiculous but I can’t help but convince myself this could become a real relationship and long term.  I have challenges building and keeping romantic relationships - I fall in love quickly and generally scare people away.  The sugar baby thing means she sticks with me despite my faults.

Second huge issue is funding this sugar “addiction” to this girl. We agreed $3k a month for an exclusive relationship - no boyfriends, no other sugar daddies.  Yes sex is involved of course but also genuine date time together. But I’ve already taken out a $17k 401(k) loan to fund 6 months with her, and as I say above currently getting a $100k heloc  of of my home equity to get me get clear of debt AGAIN.  Of course if I’m with her 6 months and more, I’ll be in fully in love with her and nearing being financially ruined.

So a big mess. Just wanted to tell my story and see who can relate. Would welcome constructive advice and comments. Please don’t judge me for stupidity with money or morality of sex workers and sugar babies.   I’m on medication, have a great psychiatrist and new therapist, but haven’t as yet been brave enough to share the full extent of the financial side.

,bipolar,"39M, Argentinian living in Argentina

Diagnosed: mid 2019 during 1st and only hospitalization.

First symptoms looking back: Late 2016

Current meds:
Lithium
Lamotrigine 
Wellbutrin XP
Clonazepam
Olanzapine

I’ve been having these 2 not urgent but persistent and life altering symptoms:

1. I can’t get up at the time I want in the morning. It’s as if there’s a force greater than me that doesn’t let me. Please don’t think that I’m just being lazy lol. It might be related to not wanting to confront my current job because I’m able to get up for other activities (therapies, on weekends, etc). Ideally I wake up several hours before my work starts (11am) and am able to go run some errand, run, gym, swim, go to a nice place for breakfast. I have no trouble sleeping and I’m not in a (hypo)manic state. I have no trouble identifying signs for those states and those are not the case.

2. I’m stable and balanced but I seem to have lost that “life-spark” that makes you want to create things, activities or any kind of new things. It’s as I’m existing only to respond to outside triggers (work requests, friend calls, medical suggestions). It’s not terrible but I have a little voice inside saying that I’m wasting my life away. I once believed this was related to Lithium. Tried leaving it for Lamotrigine (during the course of 1 month) and had strong paranoia episodes. So went back to Lithium.

Anyone having similar symptoms or advice?

,bipolar,"Ugh. I hate everything. Things just keep getting worse and I'm just waiting for what will come after my next grippy sock vacation.

So I'm diagnosed with Severe Major Depression but my psyc doctor is keeping an eye out for bipolar. Given my past history of being really depressed all the time, but also swings of what we both think is mania. I'm about 2 years out from telling anyone anything. That only happened because I fully lost my shit and no longer saw a way out. Someone stood between my firearms and me... and they called 911. Since then I've been committed twice, sold all my firearms, and been put on meds for the first time.

For the last 2 years I've been trying. For the 17 years before that (I'm 36) I was hiding everything. But I've been trying. I take my meds, I communicate with my doctor, I talk to my Significant Other. But everything is still just going down hill. The suicidal ideation are back and brought thoughts of self harm/ mutilation and homicidal ideations with it.

I am looking for advise. Assume that I end up committed again AND it leads me to lose my license and job, what happens? I don't pay into social security so I don't think I would get anything that way. What would happen if I lost my ability to work because of my mental health?

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m diagnosed with Severe Major Depression but my psyc doctor is keeping an eye out for bipolar. Given my past history of being really depressed all the time, but also swings of what we both think is mania. I&amp;#39;m about 2 years out from telling anyone anything. That only happened because I fully lost my shit and no longer saw a way out. Someone stood between my firearms and me... and they called 911. Since then I&amp;#39;ve been committed twice, sold all my firearms, and been put on meds for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last 2 years I&amp;#39;ve been trying. For the 17 years before that (I&amp;#39;m 36) I was hiding everything. But I&amp;#39;ve been trying. I take my meds, I communicate with my doctor, I talk to my Significant Other. But everything is still just going down hill. The suicidal ideation are back and brought thoughts of self harm/ mutilation and homicidal ideations with it.&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"Long post, but detail needed to explain my story.  (52 M) New to this group. Have been Bipolar 2 diagnosed since I was about 18.  I had trauma when my 15 year old brother was killed in an accident on vacation, which I’m sure also contributed to my issues.  Despite this, I’ve been lucky enough to manage to hold down a well paying job, 16 years at my current employer. Was married 19 years, divorced as of 18 months ago, have two wonderful kids and we are all on very good terms. My ex even supports me emotionally and worries about me.

Two things that are major issues for me, becoming worse than ever now. First financial  -  despite earning $250k+, when married we always ended up way over spending. Some of it was also my ex’s fault, but when we divorced we were $100k in debt, just from credit cards. Luckily we had enough equity in our home to clear that. 

Now after buying my own home, 18 months later I’m almost $100k in debt again. Credit cards, $15k property tax bill I didn’t escrow, income tax bill, and embarrassed to admit money spent on girls - strip clubs, sex workers. That’s another story. Some of this was bad financial management, but much I would attribute to mania, spending on stuff like Hi-Fi gear, and the girls to alleviate my loneliness, difficulties with relationships, plus feeling the constant need for sex when manic.

Second, in the last month, I’ve gotten into a sugar baby relationship. Found a girl on one of these sugar websites living locally who is a stunning 26 year old from Ukraine. Absolutely not a bimbo, she’s smart, and works as artist. She sugars to support herself and develop her business and art. Again the morality of the sugar lifestyle is another topic.  I believe there is very much a difference with a long term sugar relationship and a sex worker.

Two thoughts here that concern me. I’m developing feelings for this girl after a month and 6 dates.  She certainly enjoys being with me and finds me attractive - these girls can choose from 100s of guys on these sites. But of course she’s doing it for the money.  I know I’m being ridiculous but I can’t help but convince myself this could become a real relationship and long term.  I have challenges building and keeping romantic relationships - I fall in love quickly and generally scare people away.  The sugar baby thing means she sticks with me despite my faults.

Second huge issue is funding this sugar “addiction” to this girl. We agreed $3k a month for an exclusive relationship - no boyfriends, no other sugar daddies.  Yes sex is involved of course but also genuine date time together. But I’ve already taken out a $17k 401(k) loan to fund 6 months with her, and as I say above currently getting a $100k heloc  of of my home equity to get me get clear of debt AGAIN.  Of course if I’m with her 6 months and more, I’ll be in fully in love with her and nearing being financially ruined.

So a big mess. Just wanted to tell my story and see who can relate. Would welcome constructive advice and comments. Please don’t judge me for stupidity with money of morality of sex workers and sugar babies.   I’m on medication, have a great psychiatrist and new therapist, but haven’t as yet been brave enough to share the full extent of the financial side.

So I haven’t had a mood episode for over a year. But lately I’ve been having psychosis symptoms again.

,schizophrenia,"Hi all. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar over a decade ago as a young adult. In my time reading people talk about the voices they hear, the typical voices seem to be purely coming from the self. Or towards the self in a very specific type of voice. For example Satan telling the person to cut themselves or that they're not worthy, etc.

I was wondering if anyone knows of a type of auditory hallucination where the person hears voices that feel purely external, like hearing the guy on the radio say ""I'm going to kill you \_\_(persons name)\_\_\_\_"", or hearing what sounds like a zoom call in another room where there are several different distinct voices chatting about how to go about killing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. And going into great detail about methods, in an eerily realistic conversational way. Another case where you hear family members actually talking about getting rid of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, then you walk around the corner into the living room to see them in person and everything seems totally normal.

It seems to me most of my auditory hallucinations have real people, or in some instances, perceived real people as the delivery method of the voices, though in reality it's the brain playing a trick. Is there a classification or any kind of information on this type of hallucination?

Title: Day 16 (Poetry) – Loaded or Empty – Schizophrenia 365
By: Steven Zilberg

—

It isn’t a lie, nor is it an exaggeration;

When you are best friends with the edge of the cliff,

Some days might feel as though you are walking through Anacostia Park;

Cherry Blossoms on both sides of you.

Other days may cause you to check the chamber and flick the safety off…

—

Now, I am not saying that the edge of the cliff is ‘the end of the line’,

If that is the case I think society might be confusing skylines with peacefully bowing out.

I can’t speak for everyone.

I can only speak for myself.

During the days I am able to plant sunflowers and hold garden snakes;

Despite sweat dripping down my forehead;

Laughing out loud, inappropriate jokes, and iced tea on a hot day are the memories worth holding onto.

—

Now, I ain’t a liar;

Nor am I going to beat around the bush.

During those days in which ‘the edge’ performs piano instrumentals,

It is fundamental society understands remedies are few and far between;

I ain’t saying I agree nor do I approve of sudden goodbyes and letters left for others to read,

All I am saying is that I understand why and how.

—

It does take a little bit of an imagination;

Folks like me that is something we got way too much of,

For the rest of you;

I don’t expect you to believe Moses separated the seas.

What do I expect of you is that you open your mind to the possibility that you and people like me walked out of the optical exam with different prescriptions.

—

I never claimed to be a painter or an illustrator,

We are going to use our imagination;

Bobby and Bill bought renaissance festival tickets for them and their little girl.

If you were observing them from afar they would seem to be a ‘normal family’.

Bobby and Bill might drink a little bit.

They read scripture and pray every night.

—

On opposite sides of the festival enters a group of friends.

All of them dressed up and ready to have fun.

One of these beautiful people is a 25 year old college student.

She choose to dress up as a Yennefer of Vengerberg,

This is where I ask for you to try on a new set of prescription glasses;

Despite her attending with friends,

Despite being reminded that she is loved and safe;

—

She witnesses everyone around her whispering,

She hears their conversations,

She is unable to decipher between multiverses,

Everyone around her is gossiping about her,

They all wear masks which shapeshift every hour,

She is touched by sorcery, spells, and charms,

Whenever she feels a tap on her shoulder and turns,

She sees nothing but strangers watching stage plays and laughing,

While she buys snacks, giant turkey legs, and beef jerky;

She is being commanded to run away, disappear, and slit her wrists.

She knows that she shouldn’t but it has been happening since turning 16.

—

Like I said before,

I am not saying that I agree but what I am claiming is that I understand why and how;

I have been in a similar position countless times.

Standing upon that edge;

Funny thing is that most people neglect the truth.

What do you think someone sees while looking down from the edge?

—

Do they see, hear, and feel an agonizing fire?

Do they see family members crying over their casket?

Do they hear the stories individual describe while dressed in black?

Do they hear the alternative options they have besides for taking hold of the cliff’s hand and saying goodbye?

—

This where new prescription glasses matter;

Whenever I have sat at the edge and looked down,

What I see and hear are peaceful musical notes,

What I see and hear are peaceful currents,

What I see and hear are less pain and less tears,

—

It isn’t a lie, nor is it an exaggeration;

When you are best friends with the edge of the cliff,

Some days might feel as though you are walking through Anacostia Park;

Cherry Blossoms on both sides of you.

Other days may cause you to check the chamber and flick the safety off…

,schizophrenia,"I want to start this off by apologizing. I’m sure y’all get plenty of “I think I have/am developing schizophrenia” posts here, and I’m sure it’s annoying. I just want to hear about people’s real experiences. I am seeing a therapist with whom I am going to talk about these issues this week. 

Basically, a previous therapist suggested the possibility of me being in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Her reasons were mainly about my constant dissociation. I don’t fit the criteria for dissociative disorders, but even using grounding exercises, I never feel like I’m really here. It’s not a “who am I” sensation, just that I feel like I’m floating either above my body or a few inches inside, like I’m a miniature consciousness sitting inside my body that I feel almost no connection to. 

I’ve had bouts of paranoia. In childhood and still a couple times here and there, I feel like there are demons in my room, and if I don’t check to make sure they aren’t there, I worry I’ll be possessed in my sleep. I also had anxiety that—when my sister’s now-ex-boyfriend lived with us—he was hiding cameras in my room and watching me. The most recent one has been anxiety that the guy I was talking to about 2 years ago is going to use our texts (which were sometimes sexual) against me. I’ve also worried that people can read my mind or that my dead relatives are watching me, but I think that’s a result of growing up religious lol. Recently I’ve been having “gut feelings” that I’m going to die soon, but it doesn’t feel like anxiety. Idk if that is necessary to add, but just in case. 

Another consistent issue I’ve dealt with is lack of feeling. I haven’t felt joy or enjoyment doing something in years. At most, it’s like, “Oh, I’d rather play video games than do absolutely nothing,” but I don’t feel enjoyment. I’ve been described as robotic at times. I have had many instances (like today) when I feel “flat.” I’m moving slowly and talking slowly, but I don’t feel depressed. 

I don’t know. I’m asking bc it’s been on my mind again, and sometimes I wonder if the reason that my depression is treatment-resistant (as diagnosed by my psychiatrist) is because I have something more going on.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway this happened after watching a scene in 2010 Frozen. Great movie but I couldn&amp;#39;t finish it. It was just too realistic and disturbing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this thing is gory. Like a head with just a spinal cord that stares at me. Thankfully all it&amp;#39;s doing is being there but it worries me&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hello and Happy New Year !  


I want to shine a light related to alogia and how do I get better over time. It was a long time since I suffered from this (like 4 years) and I was thinking to post here in case someone want to hear my story of recovery.  


Before my illness I was a quite guy but not that quieter. I used to spoke in medium sentences using the right amount of speech (not much but not little either like I used to say with alogia).  My alogia was mild says the doctors because I wasn't used sounds to comunicate only speaking in a short sentences such as yes or not or sometimes asking few question.  


  
Now I'm pretty much recovered when it comes to Alogia since I spoke like I used to before somethimes even better. For those who still struggles with alogia give it times and I believe that you can recover too. I tried severals pills to do that along with my doctor and afterone month on Piracetam my speech and toughts appears from nowhere. So I believe it's related to chemistry in our schizophrenic brain even if experts arren't sure yet. If you watch Living Well With Schizophrenia channel, Laurel says she was struggling with alogia throught out period of her illness and she clearly made a recovery.

Good luck everybody and I hope this post finds you well !

,schizophrenia,"(Diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar 2, suspected Autism)

Last night i missed my dose of abilify and i woke up at 6 am after an extremely off-putting dream. it felt very odd honestly and it gave very specific bad feeling.

After waking up, the room was very disorienting. Things kind of seemed 2D and the colors were very block-like. It felt like childhood sort of. I kept trying to shake the dream but very graphic flashes would keep popping up in my mind.

I then went to my bathroom and kept the lights open and played Tetris for a while since I saw a post on social media saying that playing it as long as possible after a traumatic event can lessen the impact and it sort of worked. The memory of the dream didn't really stay in my mind long-term.

I've been getting these sort of psychosis-like episodes more often lately even with the Abilify and I feel a little worried that it might be schizophrenia. Not that there's anything wrong with being diagnosed, but I do know it can be very debilitating.

Should I get myself checked? What next steps should I take? How do I lessen the frequency of having these episodes?

I find myself growing more and more paranoid that I'm losing my mind. What could be causing these sensations?

I'm specifically worried it may be schizophrenia since the ADHD and Bipolar symptoms can overlap. I've also found that I've changed a lot the past year in the sense that I've become more withdrawn socially and have been experiencing more frequent manic episodes.",t2_4ndvrmh8,False,,0,False,"Anyone else have weird, off-putting dreams when you forget to take antipsychotics at night?",[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18wou9z,False,light,1.0,,public,7,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Seeking Support,False,7,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1704200303.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar 2, suspected Autism)&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"I had a lot of bursts of angriness, would have awful argument, being paranoid, and ended up losing tone of friends and losing family support. And then I would feel terribly humiliated and ashamed of being such an awful friend and human being. Some old friend even told me that I was the most self-untitled bitch she ever seen. This is what helped me the most to fight less and keep my friends.

**1st, it may be counterintuitive, but the first emotion you need to manage is not anger, it's shame.** Shame as an emotion is super toxic for your brain, and schizophrenic brain triggers an insane level of shame. Very few people talk about it, but shame is the emotion of schizophrenia, the same that sadness is the emotion of depression, and anxiety is the emotion of anxiety disorder. It means that it both aggravates your disease, AND is overproduced by your sick brain.

How to deal with shame, so that your brain can rest and produce less anger? Auto-compassion is the way to regulate shame. You can take a time for yourself, think about your experience of having all this shame and facing all these awful events and gives yourself the loving embrace a parent would give to a lost child. Tell yourself how much you understand that you are having a terrible time. You can hug a pillow against your chest while doing that, cry and imagining yourself as a child. If done properly, self-compassion can help you to move from shame and access guilt, which is a less toxic emotion and gives you the will to change. (Shame is more about wanting to hide and disappear, guilt is more about understanding you don't want to act not in accord with your values, and the truth is that you have great values, you don't want to have fight with your family and friends.) (Side note: shame can mutate in pride. It is super damaging for your relationship too. If you see yourself sliding in the ""I am superior"" mindset, take yourself back to self-compassion, acceptance and healthy guilt).

**2nd, how to regulate paranoia?** Paranoia is super tricky. I deal with it both with self-help stuff (like described here : [https://mind.help/topic/paranoia/coping/](https://mind.help/topic/paranoia/coping/)), direct communication (""I may be wrong, but I am afraid X, Y, Z is happening and it makes me feel angry and sad, I am right ?"") and by having some trustworthy people that are aware of my condition and help me to deal with people when I am paranoid. For example, I make my husband read my angry messages before sending them, he validates my anger and tells me when I am going too far. He is very good in non-violent communication and active listening, and de-escalate me when I am getting super angry against someone else. So, find the most emotionally intelligent person in your surroundings, be honest with them and ask them to call you out when you are getting paranoid. This is a difficult role. They must be super good in active listening, emotion validation, and boundaries setting.

**3rd, how to regulate anger?** Anger is an emotion that tell us that our space/boundaries is invaded. So, the easiest way to get it lower is to separate us physically from what makes us angry. If you feel you are too angry, just go away. Far. Far from the person, from your phone or computer if you are having online argument. Anger is also an emotion that is powerful and needs to be expressed. So write down how angry you are AND DONT SEND IT !!! It is only for your emotion to get out of your body. And also, last resort: the ""and then what ??"" game. Repeat yourself ""and then what ??"" until you don’t give a fuck about the situation. When you have done all of that, if still angry, examine if you need to express one boundary, and have the conversation in the nicest way possible.

**4th, how to repair?** A lot of people are not able to understand what we are going through, but some will and will accept our repair attempt. And know that in relationships, connecting after an argument is more important than not having arguments. Learn how to give proper apologies ([https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology) ). I lost many friends for ever at the beginning of my disease. But some family members that I have deeply hurt are now strong allies in my recovery. I also abandon the idea that everything is fixable. Some of my bad behaviors are not fixable, and I am ok with that. When I lose some friends, I go back to self-compassion and accept that my actions have consequences, even if caused by a terrible disease.

I still have anger issues, but less often, and life is getting easier as I progress in emotion regulation.

Learn how to give proper apologies (&lt;a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology""&gt;https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology&lt;/a&gt; ). I lost many friends for ever at the beginning of my disease. But some family members that I have deeply hurt are now strong allies in my recovery. I also abandon the idea that everything is fixable. Some of my bad behaviors are not fixable, and I am ok with that. When I lose some friends, I go back to self-compassion and accept that my actions have consequences, even if caused by a terrible disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have anger issues, but less often, and life is getting easier as I progress in emotion regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

I started hallucinating more, paranoia and delusions got debilitating, wasn’t able to take care of myself, and the movement issues started.

,schizophrenia,"Okay, so this is probably going to sound weird so, apologies in advance. 

So I was formally diagnosed with schizoforum disorder when I was 15. In that time, I've had an almost rotating amount of Hallucinations - or, as my doctor and I have dubbed them, my ""Cast of Characters"" - that come and go as I've grown up (I'm 24 now). 

However, I'm worried that it makes me look like I'm faking, even though both doctor and therapist have told me that there is no way that I could be faking, because I meet everything needed to have a diagnosis in the first place. Especially because my hallucinations aren't just audible or visual - the visual matches the auditory, so when the hallucination talks, the voice matches the figure. 

I've always been self-conscious about it, because I know it sounds weird, but does anyone else have some experience with that? Anyone else's hallucinations more nice than mean?

&lt;p&gt;After a few days I started experiencing severe nausea and then morphed into indescribable brain fog. I’ve only seen one post on Reddit about peoples’ experience with AP withdrawals and many noticed their wd symptoms improved after a few months/up to a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d greatly appreciate insight into how long I should expect this to last and if there’s anything I can do to expedite the process of getting past the brain fog. It’s worth noting that I bumped back up to 3 mg (was down to 4.5 mg when I stopped) which did not improve my wd symptoms at all. Starting to think it may be worth while to drop back down to 0 and ride it out. Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

I at the time had been for several weeks, deteriorating with my mental health and I reached a point where I needed to vent or I was going to explode. 


I left a voice memo telling them about how utterly ashamed I feel to have these types of problems (hallucinations + delusions) and, lamented about how lately I’ve been insecure with the way I speak when we get to talk. Their reply made my heart totally drop. They commented that they noticed I’ve been acting really out of it lately, and cited an example of them making a joke to me on the phone. They said I apparently got scared and took it ‘really seriously’ which made them feel guilty for messing with me like that when it wasn’t their intention. And they followed this all up asking me if I was okay and if I was having an episode.

,schizophrenia,"Hi I am the little sibling of a brother who has recently developed schizophrenia.

Recently my brother had a delusion where he has no mental illness and doesn’t have schizophrenia. This is terrifying to me because he was recognizing he had it it felt like there was a chance we can move forward and try to get him medicated or at the very least allow him to use his schizophrenia to get on disability because he is currently living in aweful poverty in the other side of the country so I never get to see him physically and to let him ask my opinion on a delusion for reassurance (idk how much that would actually help but at the very least then I could know what’s going on because his situation is so horrible and I only have his words to go off of so it’s like my understanding of his life had the same schizophrenia filter on it. 

The only time I know for certain when he is telling me stuff that is a delusion is when it is text book like tearing off drywall looking for cameras, or him sending me a picture of something innocent and then sending a string of texts connecting that to a conspiracy while staring the the picture is of body bags when it is not.

When I am certain his delusions are false I don’t try to outright prove him wrong. I just want him to feel better and I am aware that when he takes a picture of a leaf and sees it as a dead body it is completely out of his control. My current understanding is that i don’t need to prove to him a delusion is false I don’t know like if that is even doable (please someone confirm or deny how possible to is to help a person with schizophrenia realize a delusion is false) but I assume it is incredibly difficult and often not worse because it risks agitating my brother, and would probably result in him justifying the delusion further cementing it in place.

Talking to my brother is very draining I haven’t spoken to him in the 4 years and I still live with my parents and he is on his own. I want to be able to talk to him about the stuff that goes on in his life so I know what’s going on but I never know when he is telling me about what’s happening in his life and his delusion (I don’t want him to avoid telling me about his delusions ever, they effect his mental state so much they are a part of his life and effect him just as much as his physical situation) but I dread conversations with him because I am very out of practice with talking to my brother the last time I did he didn’t have schizophrenia so I struggle to make conversation which results in him mostly venting, I am ok with him doing this I am ok with feeling a little drained after words it’s worth it to stay in touch and to give him a chance to vent and me to try and comfort, but I am scared by letting him vent I am hurting him more so this is something else I would like an opinion on. 

I just worry by letting him vent I am giving him more time space to allow the delusions to control his throughts which must not be good, but he also doesn’t have anyone else to talk to so he must need to vent a little bit I think it is good for him. But on the flip side I worry that having him talk about them to vent will only make them worse and stronger because when he vents about the effects his negative life situation + delusions he wants to give me context but to do so must elaborate, and I assume elaboration causes the delusions to become better thought out and more convincing.

So to make things less draining and scary every time I talk him I was thinking about outright telling him I don’t want to talk about whatever delusion that I have a decent understanding and don’t need him to talk more or when the delusion is just to big and scary and I worry talking about to will make it worse (I won’t say delusion because that would draw direct attention to it but I just will address the delusion and say I don’t want to talk about it). I assume this won’t work perfectly and he will try to continue especially if it’s very scary so I feel like if we drift back to talking about it I can tell him again I don’t want to talk about it to soften it maybe I could say I don’t want to talk about it but if it’s very important to you I can. I am ok with doing this but I want to know if this is too much of a push over thing to say that would result in him just always saying yes.

So tdlr; I am trying to help my little brother but I don’ know the right things to do. Also I am worried I’m hurting more than helping because I am scared I can only say yes to him (part of that is because I pity him because it’s so unbelievably unfair he’s suffering and I’m not. So I want to sacrifice things for my self because I don’t have it as bad as him and I want to make up for the fact that life is unfair) finally I would like some perspectives on this from people who have experience with delusions. How do you feel when people either tell you that something is a delusion or when you try to talk to someone about it and they tell you they don’t want to hear it. I want him to vent if he needs too but I also want to tell him no sometimes. So can I get some thoughts on what could happen when I outright call out a delusion for being one in response to a hidden camera/wires in wall delusion for example.",t2_lgp56td6,False,,0,False,How would you feel if you were stressing over a delusion and trying to talk about it to someone and they said they didn’t want to talk about it?,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18w7b4f,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice / Encouragement,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1704144635.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi I am the little sibling of a brother who has recently developed schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"So I’m currently struggling with unspecified psychosis that looks likely to be schizophrenia due to the fact I’ve had paranoia and delusions for many years now even prior to my recent hallucinations. 

One of my biggest struggles is that I’m completely isolated. I live with family and I basically don’t leave the house or have a single IRL friend other than some people I haven’t seen/met up with in around 5-10 years.

People and social interactions terrify me. When I used to socialise I would become paranoid that they’re laughing at me or just pretending to enjoy spending time with me. I felt afraid outside that I would be mugged or attacked. So now I just avoid leaving the house completely other than my therapy sessions and psychiatrist visits and a rare trip to the shop down the road.

I’m 31 and I feel like many of the best years of my life slipped away from me due to the isolation and I don’t want to stay this way.

Unfortunately my prescribed Risperidone has only made a small difference in this area, and I’m still so anxious around people that I even struggle to interact with my own family.

So I’m considering other options, one being trying out SSRIs or SNRIs. I’ve always been afraid of them because of their potential lasting side effects like PSSD, but I’m tired of living my life in a box and am willing to try anything at this point.

,schizophrenia,"Came across this subreddit while looking to learn more about experiences of being involuntarily hospitalized.

I’m losing my mind with my sibling (36M) who was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia a few years ago when he was also involuntarily hospitalized after getting arrested. He stopped taking his medication for over a year now and has been in a psychotic episode for five months. He lives with our very old mother and she’s his caretaker. There’s no one else but us two, our mother and me, to handle this, no one else who can intervene or talk to him. We have begged for months that he takes his medicine and he refuses completely. In those months, he has displayed really worrying behavior but hasn’t been violent against a person, and he occasionally threatens with violence. He held knives toward us once (but we knew he wouldn’t hurt us), a cutter to delivery guys, and smashed appliances around the house. He is also posting worrying stuff online, mainly threats to kill or wishes of harm against public figures.

We tried non-invasive ways of encouraging him to take his medicine, like withholding pocket money, but he is finding ways around that, mainly getting credit and accumulating a lot of debt, and also using these threats of violence to try and get money from us.

He finally opened up about what he thinks is happening and he def has delusions of self-grandeur and persecution.

After his first involuntary hospitalization he was traumatized and very resentful. He doesn’t acknowledge his illness at all. He held us accountable for hospitalizing him and he threatened many times of self harm or harming us if we hospitalize him, including before the first time.
We’re not in the US or Europe and we send him to the best hospital where we live… I can’t find or afford better than it.

,schizophrenia,"Hi everyone, I’m new here. I was hospitalized since November 21st, 2023 until December 30th, 2023. 

I believed that I was hearing voices from Jesus and that he wanted me dead. When I was working retail, I began paying for customers groceries and acting strange. I stopped taking my medication and lied to everyone that I was still taking it. I stabbed myself with a knife. I almost killed my mom. 

In the hospital, I had ECT (electric compulsive treatment) which led me to forgetting what had happened when I was schizophrenic. We had a lot of group therapy sessions. It was extremely boring in the hospital and I hope I never have to go back again.

I’m actually still schizophrenic and still hear voices if I allowed myself to talk out loud. My mouth automatically moves on its own and words come out. My rectum also moves and has a voice of its own as well. Nowadays, I’m left extremely restless and can’t stop moving.

Leading up to this, I did marijuana, mushrooms, vaping, and certain drugs. I now know that I never wanna do marijuana again because I don’t want to trigger schizophrenia. I don’t wanna do drugs anymore either. 

Honestly, I just want to lead a normal life and get in a relationship with someone and be happy. I don’t want to do drugs anymore and I don’t want to have another schizophrenic episode. I don’t want to stress or endanger my parents. I don’t want to find out more about my schizophrenia by letting my mouth move on it’s own and talking in tongues. 

I’m just curious if anyone else has their mouth move on their own too. Or if anyone believed in Jesus and that Jesus wanted them dead. I just hope to not feel so alone in my journey.

I was hospitalized since November 21st, 2023 until December 30th, 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believed that I was hearing voices from Jesus and that he wanted me dead. When I was working retail, I began paying for customers groceries and acting strange. I stopped taking my medication and lied to everyone that I was still taking it. I stabbed myself with a knife. I almost killed my mom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hospital, I had ECT (electric compulsive treatment) which led me to forgetting what had happened when I was schizophrenic. We had a lot of group therapy sessions. It was extremely boring in the hospital and I hope I never have to go back again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m actually still schizophrenic and still hear voices if I allowed myself to talk out loud. My mouth automatically moves on its own and words come out. My rectum also moves and has a voice of its own as well. Nowadays, I’m left extremely restless and can’t stop moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading up to this, I did marijuana, mushrooms, vaping, and certain drugs. I now know that I never wanna do marijuana again because I don’t want to trigger schizophrenia. I don’t wanna do drugs anymore either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I just want to lead a normal life and get in a relationship with someone and be happy. I don’t want to do drugs anymore and I don’t want to have another schizophrenic episode. I don’t want to stress or endanger my parents. I don’t want to find out more about my schizophrenia by letting my mouth move on it’s own and talking in tongues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just curious if anyone else has their mouth move on their own too. Or if anyone believed in Jesus and that Jesus wanted them dead. I just hope to not feel so alone in my journey. Thank you if you’ve read this far.&lt;/p&gt;
