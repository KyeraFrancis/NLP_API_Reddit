,Army,"I'm facing a unique challenge regarding my citizenship status that's hindering my ability to obtain a security clearance. I was born in South Africa, and my family immigrated to the US when I was young. My father obtained US citizenship while I was under his custody, making me a derived citizen. The catch is, I lack paperwork aside from an outdated passport confirming my US citizenship.

I've worked through my chain of command up to the Brigade level with limited success. The Army recognizes me as a US citizen but also insists I still hold South African citizenship. To resolve this, I believe I need paperwork renouncing my South African citizenship and possibly a certificate affirming my US citizenship. However, the process is unclear, and every visit to my S2 results in changing requirements.

My biggest hurdle is dealing with the South African government. Despite numerous attempts over 8 months, I've received minimal to no assistance. After an in-person visit to the consulate in NY, I acquired the renouncement paperwork, but it requires approval from South Africa, a process that could take up to six months.

It's been a month and a half with no updates, and my inquiries remain unanswered. I lack faith in the South African government and fear I might never see the required paperwork. Additionally, I've received conflicting information on whether the renouncement alone is sufficient or if I need additional documents like an N600.

While I understand a security clearance isn't mandatory for Army service, it's preventing me from attending SERE school and reclassing to EOD. I've exhausted my resources seeking guidance and haven't received clear answers.

If any of you have faced a similar situation or have advice on navigating this complex process, I would greatly appreciate your insights. Thanks for the help.

I was also told that you could clear CIF before your CSP but you need ETS orders but you can’t get those until you’re 90-180 days out.

,Army,"Officer with ADSO that ends May 2026 with a matching PCS anticipated for that same summer. 

Let’s say I want to get out and go to grad school. Admissions acceptance letters for my program are typically announced between January-March  for an August 15 start date of the same calendar year. 

How do I figure out all the time hacks for this process? The program often allows deferred acceptance (not guaranteed) so I’m planning to apply in 2025. However, I’m trying to plan ahead in case I don’t get into my program of choice. If I don’t get into any great programs, I might reconsider staying in (I’ve got good chances for promotion based on my corps’ stats and my record).

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say I want to get out and go to grad school. Admissions acceptance letters for my program are typically announced between January-March  for an August 15 start date of the same calendar year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I figure out all the time hacks for this process? The program often allows deferred acceptance (not guaranteed) so I’m planning to apply in 2025. However, I’m trying to plan ahead in case I don’t get into my program of choice. If I don’t get into any great programs, I might reconsider staying in (I’ve got good chances for promotion based on my corps’ stats and my record).&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"I’m calling all lifers and mainly people who’ve done 10+ years to give me their opinion. 





So I’m currently a PFC and a mechanic posting this on a burner account so 1SG doesn’t know. But anyway here’s my plan: Finish out current 4 year contract and reenlist for another 3-4 years active changing MOS with the hope of getting an overseas duty station and a bonus. After that reenlist into guard or reserve and complete the rest of my service in that and retire at 20 years. I may be wrong on how that works so please correct me.





So far I’ve been in the regular for almost a year and I do like it. I feel like most of my gripes and dislikes are because of the MOS I’m in. I don’t like being a mechanic. Crawling under humvees, loud trucks, being covered in grease everyday. Especially when we don’t have any work and they put us on a random task or do someone else job.




My plan is to 100% switch MOSs into the most POGiest MOS that doesn’t go to the field often, easy on the body and I’m not ashamed to admit it. I want to do my job and just mine no one else’s. Pretty much admin work I would assume fits that criteria. I see so many young soldiers my age just not give af about their health or what they do to their body. Imagine being made fun of for attempting to get 8 hours of sleep. It’s absolutely pathetic. Being a mechanic and in the Army is especially hard on your body And I don’t want to be broken at 30. 







I don’t want to do all the high speed schools or other branches like being a drill sergeant. I see a lot of younger soldiers who give higher ranked shit and their fellow younger soliders shit because they don’t have a CAB or don’t wear any patches. I do agree that those who go the extra mile should be rewarded but is it right to have the “if you ain’t us you ain’t shit” mentality towards others for it?





Is I know me saying all of this has you thinking why didn’t I just join the Airforce well I was but stuff happened and I’m in the Army.

,USMC,"&gt;The Justice Department announced \[26dec23\] that is has secured a settlement against Billy Joe Goines, owner and operator of Goines Towing &amp; Recovery, based near Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, to resolve allegations that he violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) by towing and then selling vehicles without disclosing to the court that they were owned by servicemembers. \*\*\*  
&gt;  
&gt;In a complaint filed on March 3, the United States alleged that Goines auctioned off, sold or otherwise disposed of motor vehicles owned by eight servicemembers in violation of the SCRA, which provides a wide variety of financial and housing protections to members of the military. The SCRA requires a towing company to file an accurate affidavit stating whether the vehicle’s owner is in military service (i.e. a military affidavit) before it can get a court judgment authorizing it to sell a stored vehicle.

&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department announced [26dec23] that is has secured a settlement against Billy Joe Goines, owner and operator of Goines Towing &amp;amp; Recovery, based near Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, to resolve allegations that he violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) by towing and then selling vehicles without disclosing to the court that they were owned by servicemembers. ***  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a complaint filed on March 3, the United States alleged that Goines auctioned off, sold or otherwise disposed of motor vehicles owned by eight servicemembers in violation of the SCRA, which provides a wide variety of financial and housing protections to members of the military. The SCRA requires a towing company to file an accurate affidavit stating whether the vehicle’s owner is in military service (i.e. a military affidavit) before it can get a court judgment authorizing it to sell a stored vehicle. If it appears that a vehicle’s owner is in military service, the court may not authorize the sale of the vehicle until it appoints an attorney to represent the interests of the servicemember. If that attorney then requests a postponement of the matter, the court must grant that request and postpone the case for at least 90 days.  The complaint here alleges that Goines either failed to file or filed inaccurate military affidavits with the court. Goines also allegedly filed military affidavits stating that he was unable to tell whether a vehicle owner was in the military even in instances where the vehicle at issue was towed from a military installation or had military decals, and instances when the vehicle owner or owner’s spouse had informed Goines of the owner’s active military service.*** &lt;a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-north-carolina-based-towing-company-resolve-violations""&gt;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-north-carolina-based-towing-company-resolve-violations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

First off I’m looking really heavy into Budgeting as I’m saving for a Car, Home Furniture, and another personal big purchase that’s roughly 2000 dollars. Is there someone at Navy Fed that can help me find the best strategies to budget for all this shit?

Second off can spouses use the gym on base?

Third, for life as a 0352 boot in the fleet what can day to day life be like? What will I do in a typical work day? when will the work day end? How much time will I have to myself to do the things I want? How often will we go to the field? 

Ive heard horror stories about the fleet are they true?

**Getting Fit: An Overview**

**Four levers to pull:**

**Training**: this is where you force adaptations in your body to get stronger, gain endurance, etc.

**Nutrition**: this is where you fuel that magnificent beast of a body and lose fat

**Activity**: this is where you stop dying early and help burn calories

**Sleep**: this helps your body recover and benefit from the other levers

**Training**: Try and get in at least one session a week of those four kinds of training:

* *Strength*: this could be barbells or machines at a gym, or pushups, pullups, and air squats at home. It could be Pilates or power yoga—anything where you are doing sets of movement that push your muscles. Don’t stress over particular programs, set/reps, etc. If you do 3-5 “hard sets” (like maybe you had another 1-2 movements in you), for basic movements like squatting down/picking things up, pushing away, pulling towards, lunging forward/sideways, and twisting, you will get stronger.
* *Cardio/Zone 2:* jogging, rucking, powewalking, biking, etc. Half an hour at a moderate pace, like 60-70% of your max heart rate (220-age). Don’t go too hard or you miss the benefit! This is your base of your endurance.
* *Metabolic/HIIT*: bursts of activity that are close to maximal: skipping rope, elliptical, sprinting, etc. The goal is to get your heartrate up very high for working sets, with active recovery in between. I like 30 seconds work/1:30 active recovery. You could do 1 minute on/1 minute recovery, etc. But something like an 8-9 on a scale of 1-10 for work, and then drop to a 5-6 for the recovery period.
* *Mobility*: just go to youtube and find a 20-30 minute routine you like (Julia Reppel and Tom Morrison are good).

**Nutrition**: This can be overwhelming, and in a culture where we are surrounded by tons of crappy food. Some manageable suggestions:

Focus on getting in good food. When you eat high quality food, you will be less likely to eat crap. Also, good fuel will help you train, recover, and improve your body.

*Eat whole foods instead of processed foods; cook as much as you can instead of take-out*. Think of Panera and McDonalds as poison dispensaries; fruit juice, granola bars, breakfast cereals, store-bought muffins, breads, and cakes are all pretty much posion. Poison, poison, poison. Replacing poison with nuts, drinking milk, searing proteins like fish and chicken, eggs, cheese, broccoli/Brussel sprouts/cabbage, etc. is a huge move in the right direction.

*Don’t kid yourself*: it doesn’t matter what some calorie counter/TDEE website says. Over the course of a week, scales aren’t informative, but over the course of months they are. If you are not gaining muscle and want to, add a small portion of food daily. If you are not losing fat and to, cut out a small portion of food daily. Reassess every two weeks and cut/add as needed.

*Cut out some obvious crap*: empty-calorie drinks like soda or caramel-frappalacho iced vente w/ extra pump+cream, potatoe chips/fries, ice-cream, etc. Set a boundary you can follow, e.g. you will have 2-scoops of ice cream once on the weekend, a peppermint latte w/ extra sprinkles. The important thing is to identify something clear you can cut out to reduce calories in (assuming you want to loose fat)—“eat less” will never work, but cutting out the mid-AM hostess snack cake daily will.

*If you drink alcohol, consider setting clear bounds to reduce consumption*, e.g. if you have a couple beers most nights, set a clear rule that you will only have 3 beers total Fri-Sat.

**Activity**: very simply, a sedentary lifestyle is deadly. Every hour you spend on the couch watching Netflix chips away at your life and health, while every hour walking/gardening/doing chores/playing with your kids is life-extending/improving. Find a way to move more often: go for a 30 min walk after dinner.

**Sleep:** Find a way to get in sleep: a cool room, no lights, calm before you go to bed, no using the bed for anything other than sleeping (and makin’ whoopee), regular bedtime—whatever it takes.

But my buddy a former DI was saying the toilet/bathroom set up (dozens of toilets in a row without doors or even stalls) is intentionally designed this way to break in and toughen up the the shy and nervous young men recruited and build comradery amongst them. He said at first all the guys are embarrassed and anxious but you later adjust as you realize you are all guys here and all the guys are doing the same thing (this has been my experience). He said after boot camp you earn your privacy and can use a toilet stall but for the new guys recruited this teaches them their place and gets them to fall in line.

,USMC,"First I understand that its a privilege but hear me out.


Essentially I am transitioning &amp; got a offer to take a 120 day skill bridge internship with General Dynamics.   The only issue is that I have 87 days of leave on the book and the program goes for 120 days. It would start in April &amp; end August 1st my final day of my contract. 

My direct SNCO wants me to be able to use it because he truly thinks that my current unit doesn’t need me as I am not used for anything but the rest of my Chain isn’t too much on board because they want me to “Train my replacement” who would arrive after the start date. Im in one of those units in which we honestly have Marines for the sake of having Marines.  Like that one commander that doesn’t use his Marines but will never admit it because he enjoys the idea of having extras on standby.

Here is where I have a issue.

1. The command I am apart of is Top heavy and as you know in Top Heavy commands Sergeants don’t do much.
2. If I go on skill bridge the command won’t approve my leave and there reasoning for is that Im supposed to use my leave dates for skillbridge which I know is false &amp; their stubbornest will make me have to sell 80+ days when I dont do anything at all.
3.  The Average work day is from 0800 - 1500 and I am serious.  It is literally a ghost town come 1430/1500. On top of that I don’t even do anything. Seriously I spend 90% of the day on youtube because my job is just misc stuff they don’t want to do like organizing files.  It usually two meetings day then every one goes home.
4.  I find it hard to think that they can’t afford to lose but others in the shop can go TAD for sports games.


How should I go about doing this.

Coming from a 6 year reservist. I dont care what bullshit you have against reservists or the current marine corps. What keeps you guys going, is the spirit. The spirit to keep it together to do your thing. Whatever it is. 

But tonight, we celebrate. Another year gone by. I love the corps. For its marines,  Its history, and their ability to adapt and overcome. I hope I’m not the only one.

Well tonight, I just wanted to say, I hope you are all safe, comfortable, and with good company. Nothing better than a group of leathernecks and go getters. The world is expecting. Hold your own and keep it together right?

I’m here for you. I can’t help but know there are some of you here tonight looking for a voice. Something to read. I’ve been there. I love you guys and girls. You’re doing what needs to be done, but with little gratitudes…marines don’t need gratitude. We know we’re good to go. But it takes a lot to admit that we do need some camaraderie. 

Too all you killers out there, I hope your in good spirits, good health, and good company. Don’t neglect. Do yourself something no one else would do. Hit the gym. Hit the chow hall. Go out with the group. Be kind and hit hard when it counts.

,bipolar,"TW: abuse, violence, suicide, self-harm

TL;DR: very very angry rage, any same-stories and fix ups?


Man, I need to vent and also portray how bad this can change who you are. Dudes, eventhrough I had a traumatic childhood and didn't learn to regulate, I did it on my own because I was so effin badass. (also because it was needed for me to survive ofc) Also, I was in therapy for years. Basically, I always try to process my and anyone else's emotions, I always mediate, I am the flower power let's find common ground with love in every dispute, I am also ferm and assertive but proud to say I am so very rarely passive agressive/agressive. People around would confirm I'm calm and ready to act if anything and I condone violence in any way shape or form.

I am F25 and have been diagnosed with MDD and GAD during the very young adulthood (should have been since childhood but whatever). Oh well 2 months ago I have been diagnosed bipolar actually and cptsd/adhd maybe, still in evaluation Idk. 

I always have been a crier. I cry when there is a overwhelming feeling. And oh boy during depression I cry my soul my heart my body out until possibly I enter deplition. Indeed I have experienced until now irritability to be increased especially when the depression was extremly severe but I always pointed it to depression symptom. Here irritability meant FcK I can't concentrate I am so angry, fck I can't read, fck there is to much noise here arghhhh, fck I cannot anymore cope with my emotions so easily I get internally angry. That's the thing. Internally. I did process it into sadness (angry is s secondary emotion and it's always about smth else, most of the time sadness to agony) and I cried as I was saying. Also I'm female and it is more socially acceptable Ig, plus in my environment I could never afford to manifest angryness cause it was too risky for everyone. And still is. 

I attempted suicide one time, right before I got any diagnosis, and I got so effin scared afterwards. Why? Because I couldn't rationally believe I would do such a thing! I felt so invalidated to the point I actually made myself believe I did not attempt it, just because I had never heard at that point of smth similar, only people planning their suicides or at least wanting to die badly. I mean yes, I did had plans at some point, and still want to die (currently in a severe mixed ep) but still I have enough control to understand that it's only my mind playing tricks on me or so I like to call it. Obvsly I was always psych educated. Now I know it's the manic features of a mixed episode that make me 'desperate to die' so to say, impulsive enough to not think through. As you can see it also was hard for me to see because all my life I thought of me as the most non-impulsive person ever lol. Plus, I am a effin psychologist and it was I swear to god impossible for me to see more than depression and maybe some postraumatic stress for myself always. No matter how much you know it is so terribly hard to see hypomania or mania for what it is. Especially when it always comes so masked and interwind for me. I am lucky enough I came out truthfully to my NEW psychistrist to things I have done (because just a tiny bit I was starting to suspect smth more is up but wouldn't accept it/couldn't point my finger on it). If I didn't I probably be hospitalized rn or dead, or anything but still not diagnosed bipolar. 

Anyways, I always knew I had some unexpressed anger and I should rejoin sports. But I also am coming out of severe burn out and never got the time or energy for that. I did many times feel like I just wanna effin scream in the woods or legit anywhere if possible. What I'm saying is that I did feel the rage but I always managed to push it through. 

But man 2 months ago I broke a window at my house with my palm because of rage. I swear I couldn't think straight. I ONLY saw black before my eyes. That's when I knew shit hit the fan. Also I was 5 days sleepless at that point because every second of night my mind was racing how I should end it. That's when I was lucky and rational enough to call an emergency app with a new doc as I was saying, he gave me smth so I don't need to go to the ER but it is sooooooooooooooooooooooo hard. 

I cannot believe the rage I can feel. I am annoyed by literally anything ever. My boyfriend chewing gets me hyperventilating in a separate room so I do not scream at him. I walk the streets and I literally think omg I wanna punch somebody I wanna just punch all these parked cars. Now I realize my teen self-harm was out of impulsive rage too, because I still feel so badly I wanna do it. I try everything, the ribber bands, the cold/hot showers, breathing, meditation (hahhahahaah) etc. I swear I can't put into words this rage. I knew about it from books and cases especially I know it's associated with time in jail especially for males with bipolar but I never thought this was possible!!!!! I still cry my ass out but I also am SO ANGRY!!!! :)

,bipolar,"After a friend cut me out of her life this past week, I have been doing exceptionally not well. Our last talk/fight basically ended with me falling apart as she broke down how much of a burden I was and just stressed her out, then me pressuring her to block me online so I couldn't reach out again and ranting about how much she never liked, cared about or wanted me. I felt some ideations again and cried when she told me she didn't want to be my friend anymore because it's too stressful. She blocked me.

This person calls me only a friend, but our relationship was always shifting and ambiguous. Our interaction was never fully platonic, often turned sexual, she was basically living here for months, texting all day every day, almost all social activities were together, she'd call me her partner for awhile, then we'd have a fight and she'd claim we were never together, or that I was never a contender for her partner, on and on. She has since pushed this idea that I was only ever some sort of fix-it project and nothing else, leading me to question the reality of things between us. She is herself autistic.

I thought I was making a lot of progress and seeing improvement on 100mg of Lamotrigine. Most of her behavior stopped triggering me at all. After some work stuff went sour and they revoked my ability to work from home, my boss said I didn't conceptually understand the job, then she and I had a fight a couple days later, where she came at me about how I confuse her so much that spending time with me makes her want to go cry in the car. I fell apart.

Since then, I met with my therapist on Weds to talk that over, then my PMHNP yesterday. We're increasing my dosage to 200mg and adding 150mg of Wellbutrin. It's been suggested I take a leave of absence from work and I finally submitted a request yesterday afternoon.

Has anyone done this and were there any issues ensuring you had enough money to survive during that time? I've asked for 3 weeks but am worried it's not enough or that I could lose my ability to live independently, and the stress and sadness and loss I'm trying to grapple with right now is feeling really overwhelming.

,bipolar,"Hey all! Long time lurker, first time poster here. 

I wanted to know some other people’s experience with exercise and sleep. 

Exercise for me is one of the absolute key tools in maintaining my mental health, along with general healthy routine and trying to keep on top of healthy habits. I am super fortunate I can afford to exercise in a private gym, in small group sessions with a trainer who is adaptable and understanding. 

One thing I have always struggled with though is the impact that exercising, particularly HIIT or 1RM days, has on my sleep. I exercise in the afternoon so it’s never too close to bed time, and I try to do a lot of mindfulness and breath work in the evening to bring myself back down to earth a bit. Sometimes I can get to sleep ok but I find myself waking up a lot in the night and struggling to stay asleep. It seems to regularly make sleep a lot harder all round. 

I suppose I’m just wondering if anyone else has a similar issue and whether they’ve found anything else that really helps?

,bipolar," An Ode to my Broken Crown

Upon my brow rests no laurel wreath,

No peace in my skull,

Only a broken crown.

It cuts into me, blood obscures my vision,

What blessing is this?

That may lead me to salvation or suicide,

That has wrought me into a man steeped in solitude,

Sleepless nights,

Soliloquies screamed alone in a padded cell.

Oh my broken crown,

Heavy do you weigh,

I writhe in pain on my lonely throne of thorns,

I rule nothing, not even myself,

I am ruled by this broken crown.

Medication dependent, I’m unrepentant,

Cloying madness, sick pride and self-loathing,

Cast down from above the clouds to rock bottom and then hurled back again,

My broken crown shrieks between my ears,

Do other people know silence?

I stand above them, yet so far below,

Peace is a fantasy.

Never for me.

My war is inside my head, 

It follows me everywhere,

Wrestling hopelessly with this broken crown.

We build my dreams brick by brick together,

My broken crown and I.

Mercurial as it is, sometimes it decides to knock them down,

It whispers to me that everything is hopeless,

Even as it helps me pick up the pieces.",t2_y3r48,False,,0,False,Wrote a little poem about my brain if anybody cares to read it,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Original Art '}, {'a': ':artist:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/0qwk9khze9za1_t5_2qnv4/artist'}]",r/bipolar,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18xjqsc,False,light,1.0,#65b1ec,public,21,0,{},,d497701c-4eee-11e1-bc20-12313d2c1af1,True,[],,False,False,,{},Original Art :artist:,False,21,,False,False,nsfw,False,,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Bipolar'}]",{},,True,,1704289519.0,richtext,,,,richtext,self.bipolar,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Ode to my Broken Crown&lt;/p&gt;

Basically I was talking to my friend who has more experience with psychiatry and they told me there’s a good chance I can get diagnosed tomorrow. I’m not in denial that I most likely have bipolar (or any mood disorder tbh) but I think I’m so scared because that means it’s real and I can’t brush it off as a “phase” (bad habit I have).

,bipolar,"DISCLAIMER : I’m not getting of bipolar medication, I’m coming off of Ativan, which was prescribed to me at a low dose for sleeping.

Thanks to our *awesome* health care system, my doctor has been backed up for WEEKS on filling prescriptions - which means I’m about to run out of Ativan and I have no refills remaining. The only option I have is to slowly take myself off of it, but I’ve definitely been dealing with insomnia/disturbed sleep. 

Last time I was medically assisted in discontinuing a medication, I was told to take it every other day (example: Monday = take before bed, Tuesday = don’t take before bed, etc.) until I was used to not being on it. It’s been helping for now, and I’ve been using melatonin as a replacement, but I definitely won’t have enough to continue this within the next couple days. 

I understand that this is not really the best option, but given my circumstances, it’s really the only one I have.

,bipolar,"Tl;dr — I believe I’ve been unknowingly experiencing hallucinations my whole life that have been induced by extreme anxiety, grief, and trauma.

I’m going to apologize in advance because this is going to be super long. I (28 F) have had bipolar II ever since I was a kid, but wasn’t formally diagnosed until a few years ago. Both of my parents have BD II and I share the same symptoms and tendencies, even as a young child. From the ages of 6 through 12, I only slept maybe 3-4 hours per night (which I believe may have been a 6-year chronic mania episode — not totally sure). Every night I would see figures in the dark and hear things that obviously weren’t there (like people walking up and down the hallway all night / seeing dark shadows and figures beside my bed). Being a kid, I believed in monsters and ghosts, so I thought those were what were keeping me up at night. I remember being so full of fear and anxiety my whole childhood about hearing and seeing things at night. I obviously grew out of that, but would still hear and see strange things. I kind of ignored it and just chalked it up to my eyes playing tricks, and would  also convince myself that I didn’t actually hear anything. I lived with my grandparents due to the severe consequences of my parents’ bipolar episodes, and when I tried talking to them about it, but they never believed me. Once I turned 17, the sounds and figures went away. However, they briefly appeared again when my mom passed away in a car accident. I saw my mom standing in my kitchen once, and occasionally heard her voice. My mom’s death was extremely traumatic, so I had gotten into some new age stuff at that time to cope, and convinced myself that maybe it was her spirit or something. The sights and sounds of her stopped, and I lost interest in spirituality. 

Fast forward to a week ago — I realized I was dipping into a full blown mixed episode. I’ve been trying to ride it out, but it seemed to be getting worse. I got into a pretty serious argument with my boyfriend New Year’s night, and we are currently on the verge of breaking up. and have been in a panicked state with severe anxiety. I have some trauma from abandonment, so this is causing me an unbearable amount of anxiety, panic, and stress. As you all know, BD makes it difficult to be in a healthy relationship, and a lot of us end up alone because of it. 

Last night I started seeing shadows that were similar to what I saw as a kid. And this morning as I was laying in bed, I saw a man standing in my bedroom. He disappeared after about 10 seconds, which felt like the longest 10 seconds of my life. I got the same feelings of anxiety and fear as I did when I was a kid.

I started reading things online, and realized that my bipolar episode, coupled with my overwhelming anxiety, may be causing hallucinations. I’ve been thinking about my experiences when I was a kid, and I’m starting to think that I’ve been experiencing hallucinations my whole life. I know now that bipolar disorder can cause hallucinations, especially coupled with extreme fear, anxiety, and trauma (this wasn’t something I was aware of until today). I guess I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? Like hallucinations due to anxiety and or old feelings resurfacing from previous trauma? I’m going to address this with my doctor, but some advice on how to manage would also be great. I’m afraid I’m going to have hallucinations that last for years again. I’m also not going to rule out the possibility of schizophrenia. I’m currently on 150mg of Lamotrigine, so maybe I need to increase my dose.

I saw my mom standing in my kitchen once, and occasionally heard her voice. My mom’s death was extremely traumatic, so I had gotten into some new age stuff at that time to cope, and convinced myself that maybe it was her spirit or something. The sights and sounds of her stopped, and I lost interest in spirituality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a week ago — I realized I was dipping into a full blown mixed episode. I’ve been trying to ride it out, but it seemed to be getting worse. I got into a pretty serious argument with my boyfriend New Year’s night, and we are currently on the verge of breaking up. and have been in a panicked state with severe anxiety. I have some trauma from abandonment, so this is causing me an unbearable amount of anxiety, panic, and stress. As you all know, BD makes it difficult to be in a healthy relationship, and a lot of us end up alone because of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I started seeing shadows that were similar to what I saw as a kid. And this morning as I was laying in bed, I saw a man standing in my bedroom. He disappeared after about 10 seconds, which felt like the longest 10 seconds of my life. I got the same feelings of anxiety and fear as I did when I was a kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started reading things online, and realized that my bipolar episode, coupled with my overwhelming anxiety, may be causing hallucinations. I’ve been thinking about my experiences when I was a kid, and I’m starting to think that I’ve been experiencing hallucinations my whole life. I know now that bipolar disorder can cause hallucinations, especially coupled with extreme fear, anxiety, and trauma (this wasn’t something I was aware of until today). I guess I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? Like hallucinations due to anxiety and or old feelings resurfacing from previous trauma? I’m going to address this with my doctor, but some advice on how to manage would also be great. I’m afraid I’m going to have hallucinations that last for years again. I’m also not going to rule out the possibility of schizophrenia. I’m currently on 150mg of Lamotrigine, so maybe I need to increase my dose. I don’t know, but thoughts and advice are welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"I'm not asking for a diagnosis or psychiatric advice, just a suggestions to help me understand better.

Since I was younger I've had what feels to me as consistent psychosis with short breaks in between (I can't remember the exact age but I remember having them more than not). The ones I remember were believing people could hear my thoughts, dreams potentially accessed in the future so I couldn't dream, sound and video recording of me in my room, believing everyone around me was fake (this was a repeated one where I believed I was either in some form of hell/simulation where I was the only conscious being \[this stayed with me a worrying amount of time\]), the most recent and terrifying one was believing the house across the road was recording me. In the final one I even spoke to my mom about seeing someone wear a mask in the window and staring at me for hours, I believed I saw a red little light from someone's window that turned off whenever I looked through my window. This resulted in me keeping my blinds shut for months and living in complete darkness, I even attempted to record them to have evidence, often it kept me up late at night looking through a gap in my blind. This final one was around 3-4 years ago (my memory is incredibly foggy) and I haven't had any others since.

When I looked into the schizophrenia and psychosis a year or two after the final one it felt surreal that I could have these ideas and questioned if I'd even know if they were fake if I really had experienced psychosis. When I began looking into it, this was at a time when I was going through the process of getting an autism diagnosis; I have now been diagnosed with both Autism and ADHD including flags for generalised anxiety and depression. So now, I question whether these experiences were real or conjured from an imagination.

Firstly, I believe they started before the age of 12 (although as previously mentioned I have very foggy memory), as I have read it appears to be abnormal to begin having such events at that age. Secondly, Autism and Schizophrenia comorbidity is very rare to my knowledge and seems unlikely. Thirdly, from my memory, psychosis occurs due to an excess of dopamine, this is contradictory to ADHD as I would of had significantly lower dopamine. Overall, my age and lack of recent events makes me skeptical of my past experiences, I struggle to tell if they are even real when writing - I know I experienced those things and believed them to be real but was it just childlike behabiour; and, why now have I stopped having any events when on ADHD meds which should hypothetically mean I experience psychosis if I infact had something of the sort.

What&amp;#39;s the best way to deal with your problems? Medication only does so much and comes with side effects. I find that if I keep busy, that helps a lot. Being stuck in a mental health ward really perpetuates unproductivity, which leads to further mental health problems. So, being active tends to make me feel better and reduce symptoms. Well, I wish you well in your lives and hope you find something of value from the little I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"hi, guys! i’ve struggled with psychosis a few times in my life but this is one of the first times i’m seeing it in someone else. it’s an extremely long story but my boyfriend believes people from the place he worked 2 years ago (call it workplace A) where he had a very deep conversation and lost time from are talking to other people at his current workplace. when he first talked to them he couldn’t stop talking about it for a few months and he said he predicted things that have happened now and about how great the conversation was. he said his boss was on the phone with other people when it happened but he didn’t know who. at one point he had some kind of revenge plan about someone in upper management where he used to work because he thought they were involved and he says they called him slurs. he changed locations and got fired for problems he was having with another coworker. he said the coworker was put up to harassing him basically. 

then he started at workplace B where he had a hotel room paid for by the company and he thought there were cameras in the room and that everyone thought he was on drugs because he is prescribed adderall. he thought people from workplace B were also connected to workplace A and that management from workplace A used to work at workplace B. he quit there because he hated it. 

now he thinks people from workplace A and B and at his new job C are talking about him and talked to his doctor (who is my mom’s boss) to change his medication and that people from there also called me and i talked to them. he got a new job at workplace C driving food deliveries and he seemed happy for a few weeks. he overshared at his interview which he has done everywhere he worked. but now he thinks people from workplace C are also out to get him and know what happened at workplace A/ were there on the phone call. 

there’s a lot more i can’t remember but the point is yesterday he called his sister explaining all this because he thought a specific woman he is having problems with knows his sister. his sister obviously thought something was wrong and didn’t believe him and was talking to him about mental acuity and told him to see his doctor as an emergency appointment. he talked on the phone to his doctor and got a referral to a neurologist. except he only talked to his doctor about possibly having autism because he has been saying he has autism and at one point thought he was diagnosed but i told him a family doctor cannot diagnose him with autism. ive been telling him to be completely honest and talk about everything from his first workplace to now. hopefully even if he wasnt going there for symptoms of psychosis, with this whole story; a neurologist wouldnt miss it. 

a month ago i wrote this whole letter trying to talk to him about his paranoia because he thought i was on the phone call 2 years ago and that my mom was also on the phone call. because supposedly when he came home that day we were sitting on the couch and he felt like we were staring. i told him i talk to my mom sometimes and it has nothing to do with him and that me and my mom sharing the couch isnt that weird. 

now when he was eating breakfast he said i was having secret phone calls months ago talking about him. he thinks people are trying to learn really private inappropriate things about him. i told him i didnt talk to anyone about him and that im really worried he might be going through psychosis and he got up and left and went on a walk. i just want to know if anyone has had similar experiences on either end and what i can do to be there for him while not reinforcing his delusions? he doesnt seem to understand why i get upset when he is making accusations about me or people i know.

,schizophrenia,"I am a feminine bodied person. I have mentioned all this to a therapist. This is an organized way for me to potentially present what I go through to the feminine body gaurdian I lived with.

I lived in a family where the feminine bodied guardian did all the work, and the masculine body guardian stayed at home (non-working, unsure of status now).

when I was younger, I would experience non-consensual visuals, where my masculine body guardian was having sex with me. Even in the visuals it was very clear that I was uncomfortable with what was going on and the masculine body parent would be aware that I was uncomfortable in the visuals and still continue.

some of the visuals I would experience when I was younger, was me being in a ring with young, feminine bodied, people, and men and dark burgundy, maroon brown coats would be having sex with the children, and I was one of those children. this was before I knew about sex, orgies, or sex rings. I started to have visuals of me in a room with different bed and the masculine bodied gaurdian I grew up with was raping me.

when I went to college, I started noticing that right when I was about to orgasm, the visual would come up of the masculine bodied gaurdian, and he would take all of the energy that was released from my orgasm. I did send a text to the masculine body guardian, telling him to stop taking my sexual energy.

Today I had a dream that the masculine body gaurdian transformed into another masculine bodied form, and had sex with me, and then avoided me at all costs. It was only after I woke up that I realize that the boy that I had been chasing in my dream and then ignored me, was my masculine bodied gaurdian.

even after I woke up, I did a bit of moving the energy by taking my hands and physically removing the places where I can feel the masculine body gaurdians energy. Yesterday I could smell the masculine body guardian when I was awake and I thought about how non-consensual it felt to be able to smell my masculine body guardian because I do not want to interact with my masculine bodied guardian on air through waves.

Anyone experience anything similar with gaurdians or sibilings?

I'm posting this in the hope of starting a dialogue with anyone who may have experienced something within the dynamics of their family. How did you handle it? Did you discover any strategies or support systems that aided you in navigating through these profoundly personal encounters?

Your narratives, perspectives and any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Lets establish a nurturing environment, for those who have faced obstacles.

I’m not sure if it can be connoted to psychotic disorders (then again I’m not neccessarily emotionally invested in the labels, i would like to hear experiences instead because i feel alone and I’m a frequent poster here, on other subs i wasn’t even allowed to post this)

It really sucks, bc it’s like i feel everything as if i was experiencing it 5 fold, but at the same time, i dont understand it and my empathy is limited to feeling, i cannot care, only feel like i re-live trauma but I’m not really interested, mostly bc of how much distress it makes me feel

its like you tell me someone died, i would probably feel anxious if you talk about it long enough but i will still not really care. i had some major empathy errors in my life, often when something bad happened to other people or someone got in front of my own needs, i always think about myself, i dont really know what is it like to care without having intense physical pain from it. I either would give my life for someone or not care at all and not much in between, even that turns on and off so suddenly i stop or start caring

the day before yesterday my best friend was in tears from physical pain and i didnt understand her cue that was politely telling me that she can’t talk right now, i couldnt understand why would she be so upset, i simoly didnt have the ability, same with everything else, but if it’s not my best friend then most of the personal distress is gone, i simply dont feel moved unless I’m manipulated into it by the WAY the story is told, last time my friend had an autistic meltdown bc of not getting ice cream (we are 19 and 21(me)) and it felt worse than when i hear news of someones passing, i felt absolutely in despair what to do and as i saw her getting more and more involved i kind of broke to pieces as well, it felt like someone was shouting at me

i wake up and my first thought “you dont deserve to live you emotionless worthless monstér / error”

if someone told me in a chill way “yeah i broke my legs and lost an arm”

i would think “alright, anyways that sucks but it’s not my problem, I refuse to talk about topics that bother me”

but i dont want to hurt anyone so i will just say “yeah im sorry, it must suck, you feeling better?”

otherwise they come at me furiously and i start feeling extreme shame (i self harmed bc of that)

i wish i didnt feel THIS amount of guilt

anyone else?

,schizophrenia,"In 2018 I started hearing things, mainly whispering. I thought I was going crazy so I saw psych who said I had drug induced psychosis from smoking weed. Over a year I tried 5 different antipsychotics, none of which helped.

In 2019 I took Abilify that gave me really bad unintentional movements, my arm leg etc would randomly kick or punch. Would happen 100s of times a day. Got better over a year but still sometimes to this day my head jerks back and blink really hard, or my eyelids close and then flutter for a second. But I think what caused it is that the same kind of thing had been going on with me since I was a kid, when id close my eyes I sometimes start to blink rapidly, its like that now just way way worse.

I saw a neurologist who said medication doesn't work for the type I have, said I have eyelid myoclonia. He asked me about my driver's license 3 times during the appointment and said he didn't want me to get an EEG cause I'd instantly lose it if failed.

I haven't seen any psych or neuro for a long time since then. The hearing things is way better. I think I was paying attention to them too much, it always seems to happen if I listen for it. Most of the time it isn't even voices, usually it's music or sound effects.

I've had a lot of family deaths recently, lostmyjob etc. went and saw a psychiatrist last month. She thinks I probably have epilepsy though and doesn't want to give me anything that might make it worse. She said she's gonna try n talk to the neuro I saw but I really don't want to look too much into it because they have very strict laws about driving with epilepsy where I live.

I think I have to go back and see the neurologist and ask him some questions.

I thought I was going crazy so I saw psych who said I had drug induced psychosis from smoking weed. Over a year I tried 5 different antipsychotics, none of which helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019 I took Abilify that gave me really bad unintentional movements, my arm leg etc would randomly kick or punch. Would happen 100s of times a day. Got better over a year but still sometimes to this day my head jerks back and blink really hard, or my eyelids close and then flutter for a second. But I think what caused it is that the same kind of thing had been going on with me since I was a kid, when id close my eyes I sometimes start to blink rapidly, its like that now just way way worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a neurologist who said medication doesn&amp;#39;t work for the type I have, said I have eyelid myoclonia. He asked me about my driver&amp;#39;s license 3 times during the appointment and said he didn&amp;#39;t want me to get an EEG cause I&amp;#39;d instantly lose it if failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t seen any psych or neuro for a long time since then. The hearing things is way better. I think I was paying attention to them too much, it always seems to happen if I listen for it. Most of the time it isn&amp;#39;t even voices, usually it&amp;#39;s music or sound effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of family deaths recently, lostmyjob etc. went and saw a psychiatrist last month.

,schizophrenia,"My partner told me yesterday when I was beating myself up that I need to accept the reality that I'm disabled. 

I was basically telling her that I was supposed to be something great, I was an A+ student before all of this hit and was in my second year of college (had to drop out), I wanted to be in the medical field... now I just feel stupid and useless and so DUMB, like my brain just feels so intolerably dumb.

I did have one other dream, to write fiction novels, but I don't know if I could ever follow through on that or if I would be successful. 

I can't work because it's too stressful, I can barely go to the grocery store or a doctor's appointment without being overwhelmed the rest of the day.

,schizophrenia,"I've been through DBT a few times and actually found it useful, as boring as it was. The core skills are observe the surroundings/feelings/situation, describe it, and taking a non-judgemental stance on yourself, the situation.

Another couple good skills were:

Squared breathing; inhale for 4-6 seconds, hold for 4-6 seconds, exhale for 4-6 seconds. There are lots of guided videos on it. Helped my anxiety a lot 

Mindfulness/meditation; I didn't like traditional meditation and it took me a while to understand you weren't quieting the mind but rather watching it go by without judgment. So I found walking meditation to be more helpful at first. You essentially silently walk at a slower pace and look at your environment with non-judgement.

Turning the mind from CBT

The core skills are observe the surroundings/feelings/situation, describe it, and taking a non-judgemental stance on yourself, the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another couple good skills were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squared breathing; inhale for 4-6 seconds, hold for 4-6 seconds, exhale for 4-6 seconds. There are lots of guided videos on it. Helped my anxiety a lot &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness/meditation; I didn&amp;#39;t like traditional meditation and it took me a while to understand you weren&amp;#39;t quieting the mind but rather watching it go by without judgment. So I found walking meditation to be more helpful at first. You essentially silently walk at a slower pace and look at your environment with non-judgement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few honorable mentions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning the mind from CBT 
ART therapy (not crafts it&amp;#39;s an acronym for something) 
TIPP skill&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"(TLDR down below)

Hello all,
New person here, not diagnosed or evaluated for schizophrenia. Looking for advice on my present predicament which is as follows...

Back in 2020 I got diagnosed with depression, CPTSD, and ADHD. I started taking buproprion(atypical antidepressant with stimulant properties) which did wonders for my adhd and depression, not so much for my anxiety. 
I took it for 2.5 years and in doing so the following happened:
1. I drank on it multiple times.
2. I combined it with concentrated THC 🍃 multiple times.
3. My seizures threshold got lowered as indicated on the bottle by buproprion.
4. I started having seizures from combing the above mentioned drugs.
5. Through therapy, conversations, evaluation found out I've had small episodes of derealization/depersonalization at a very early age alongside auditory hallucinations in very early childhood(2-3 years old) from pneumonia/codeine/etc.
6. I didn't tell my doctor out of fear of losing the only antidepressant that worked for me, SSRIs made me incredibly ill. 
5. had about 20 seizures over the course of 2.5 years 
6. Came off of everything last year in sequential self imposed cold turkey sessions..

Up until about 6 months ago I had 0 concern for my wellbeing/existence, I've since found my own meaning/purpose for myself to pursue, and alongside it I've started having an unexpected side effect from all the recent drug abuse, withdrawal, therapy, and practices.

Occasionally when I relax my brain and decompress from anxiety, I have 2nd person auditory verbal hallucinations, and they have slowly progressed from single words to short sentences..

They're not violent or mean, but they do surprise me at first.
At times it feels like another person talking, and it happens in my dreams now as well.

My question(s) after all that, is how can I lean into this a bit more and see where this goes ? 
Is that a bad idea ?
Is there something else I should look out for ?
Does anyone have advice for how I might be able to bring this more to the front of my attention and have some agency over it ?

Currently I take 0 medication, and intend to continue the status quo.

TLDR - I messed up my brain with prescribed medication and unprescribed medication, 20 seizures and 3 years later I now have verbal hallucinations and I feel like I have another person talking in my head, therapist knows, and I want to push the dial a little, anyone know something I could try to lean into these hallucinations a little more?",t2_ktw11r8q,False,,0,False,Seeking opinions/advice.,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18xhl8j,False,light,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger Warning,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1704282548.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(TLDR down below)&lt;/p&gt;

It fits my current situation. It's full of solitude,

This nightmare showed me what hell is like.   
It was a torture dream that kept repeating, but with everchanging situations.  
They kind of killed me, then I 'woke up' in another similar dream, and they kept killing me again.

But this time ""they invaded"" my mind very heavily in my sleep and I could hear their voices again

,schizophrenia,"Hello, I was recently diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia after a two month hospitalization. I have never had this diagnosis before.

Some of the features of what I experience has been characterized as 'rigid thinking,' disorganized thinking, delusions etc.

I have also struggled with splitting, but thankfully that improved significantly while in the hospital.

I would appreciate feedback on a couple of issues:

1) I have rigid thinking and sometimes struggle with integrating different parts of myself - I experience my different modes as very different but still the same person. Can anyone relate to this experience?

2) I daydream very regularly and sometimes struggle to discern when my mind is experiencing reality.

&lt;p&gt;Some of the features of what I experience has been characterized as &amp;#39;rigid thinking,&amp;#39; disorganized thinking, delusions etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also struggled with splitting, but thankfully that improved significantly while in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate feedback on a couple of issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) I have rigid thinking and sometimes struggle with integrating different parts of myself - I experience my different modes as very different but still the same person. Can anyone relate to this experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) I daydream very regularly and sometimes struggle to discern when my mind is experiencing reality.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hi all,

My family member (25M) was diagnosed with schizophrenia about 4 years ago. I want to help him as he is starting to enter a state of psychosis. This has lead to him unfortunately putting himself in not so great situations (he was jumped by 5 guys last week) his reasoning was this group of people looked like good people so the stars told him to follow them.

When he is in this state he starts to just go on long (and dangerous) walks. I have attempted calls to crisis services and he also had an appointment with his psychiatrist whom says nothing is wrong. I fail to understand how the psychiatrist is unable to see but I guess that it is a given as they don’t spend nearly as much time with him as I do.

I wanted to know if there’s anything that calms someone down when they’re in this state, I know there is no convincing him what he believes isn’t real, others have tried. I believe that he believes these very specific things and I won’t dispute it with him. (Government poisoning, UFOS talking to him, stars talking to him) 

He has now entered a state where he refuses to eat, and paces the house while blaring music in his headphones very very loudly.

Since professional help deems him a safe member of society with no plans for admission, is there anything I can do to help?

Also, I want to apologize in advance for my ignorance to this condition, I can’t possibly understand what he or anyone else is going through, just want to help.

&lt;p&gt;Also, I want to apologize in advance for my ignorance to this condition, I can’t possibly understand what he or anyone else is going through, just want to help.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hi all. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar over a decade ago as a young adult. In my time reading people talk about the voices they hear, the typical voices seem to be purely coming from the self. Or towards the self in a very specific type of voice. For example Satan telling the person to cut themselves or that they're not worthy, etc.

I was wondering if anyone knows of a type of auditory hallucination where the person hears voices that feel purely external, like hearing the guy on the radio say ""I'm going to kill you \_\_(persons name)\_\_\_\_"", or hearing what sounds like a zoom call in another room where there are several different distinct voices chatting about how to go about killing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. And going into great detail about methods, in an eerily realistic conversational way. Another case where you hear family members actually talking about getting rid of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, then you walk around the corner into the living room to see them in person and everything seems totally normal.

It seems to me most of my auditory hallucinations have real people, or in some instances, perceived real people as the delivery method of the voices, though in reality it's the brain playing a trick. Is there a classification or any kind of information on this type of hallucination?

Title: Day 16 (Poetry) – Loaded or Empty – Schizophrenia 365
By: Steven Zilberg

—

It isn’t a lie, nor is it an exaggeration;

When you are best friends with the edge of the cliff,

Some days might feel as though you are walking through Anacostia Park;

Cherry Blossoms on both sides of you.

Other days may cause you to check the chamber and flick the safety off…

—

Now, I am not saying that the edge of the cliff is ‘the end of the line’,

If that is the case I think society might be confusing skylines with peacefully bowing out.

I can’t speak for everyone.

I can only speak for myself.

During the days I am able to plant sunflowers and hold garden snakes;

Despite sweat dripping down my forehead;

Laughing out loud, inappropriate jokes, and iced tea on a hot day are the memories worth holding onto.

—

Now, I ain’t a liar;

Nor am I going to beat around the bush.

During those days in which ‘the edge’ performs piano instrumentals,

It is fundamental society understands remedies are few and far between;

I ain’t saying I agree nor do I approve of sudden goodbyes and letters left for others to read,

All I am saying is that I understand why and how.

—

It does take a little bit of an imagination;

Folks like me that is something we got way too much of,

For the rest of you;

I don’t expect you to believe Moses separated the seas.

What do I expect of you is that you open your mind to the possibility that you and people like me walked out of the optical exam with different prescriptions.

—

I never claimed to be a painter or an illustrator,

We are going to use our imagination;

Bobby and Bill bought renaissance festival tickets for them and their little girl.

If you were observing them from afar they would seem to be a ‘normal family’.

Bobby and Bill might drink a little bit.

They read scripture and pray every night.

—

On opposite sides of the festival enters a group of friends.

All of them dressed up and ready to have fun.

One of these beautiful people is a 25 year old college student.

She choose to dress up as a Yennefer of Vengerberg,

This is where I ask for you to try on a new set of prescription glasses;

Despite her attending with friends,

Despite being reminded that she is loved and safe;

—

She witnesses everyone around her whispering,

She hears their conversations,

She is unable to decipher between multiverses,

Everyone around her is gossiping about her,

They all wear masks which shapeshift every hour,

She is touched by sorcery, spells, and charms,

Whenever she feels a tap on her shoulder and turns,

She sees nothing but strangers watching stage plays and laughing,

While she buys snacks, giant turkey legs, and beef jerky;

She is being commanded to run away, disappear, and slit her wrists.

She knows that she shouldn’t but it has been happening since turning 16.

—

Like I said before,

I am not saying that I agree but what I am claiming is that I understand why and how;

I have been in a similar position countless times.

Standing upon that edge;

Funny thing is that most people neglect the truth.

What do you think someone sees while looking down from the edge?

—

Do they see, hear, and feel an agonizing fire?

Do they see family members crying over their casket?

Do they hear the stories individual describe while dressed in black?

Do they hear the alternative options they have besides for taking hold of the cliff’s hand and saying goodbye?

—

This where new prescription glasses matter;

Whenever I have sat at the edge and looked down,

What I see and hear are peaceful musical notes,

What I see and hear are peaceful currents,

What I see and hear are less pain and less tears,

—

It isn’t a lie, nor is it an exaggeration;

When you are best friends with the edge of the cliff,

Some days might feel as though you are walking through Anacostia Park;

Cherry Blossoms on both sides of you.

Other days may cause you to check the chamber and flick the safety off…

,schizophrenia,"I’ve been taking my medication and going to therapy for 1 year now, and I finally feel ready to get a job with my bachelor’s degree. I’ve been in recovery for all of 2023, going to the hospital 4 different times. I’ve been to mental hospitals in one of the top 10 most dangerous cities in the United States and been sent far away from my home. I’ve experienced some traumatic things in those places, but I’m putting all of that behind me. I haven’t had an episode in a long time. I can finally look in the mirror and not just see my schizophrenia, but see myself as a normal person.

,schizophrenia,"I want to start this off by apologizing. I’m sure y’all get plenty of “I think I have/am developing schizophrenia” posts here, and I’m sure it’s annoying. I just want to hear about people’s real experiences. I am seeing a therapist with whom I am going to talk about these issues this week. 

Basically, a previous therapist suggested the possibility of me being in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Her reasons were mainly about my constant dissociation. I don’t fit the criteria for dissociative disorders, but even using grounding exercises, I never feel like I’m really here. It’s not a “who am I” sensation, just that I feel like I’m floating either above my body or a few inches inside, like I’m a miniature consciousness sitting inside my body that I feel almost no connection to. 

I’ve had bouts of paranoia. In childhood and still a couple times here and there, I feel like there are demons in my room, and if I don’t check to make sure they aren’t there, I worry I’ll be possessed in my sleep. I also had anxiety that—when my sister’s now-ex-boyfriend lived with us—he was hiding cameras in my room and watching me. The most recent one has been anxiety that the guy I was talking to about 2 years ago is going to use our texts (which were sometimes sexual) against me. I’ve also worried that people can read my mind or that my dead relatives are watching me, but I think that’s a result of growing up religious lol. Recently I’ve been having “gut feelings” that I’m going to die soon, but it doesn’t feel like anxiety. Idk if that is necessary to add, but just in case. 

Another consistent issue I’ve dealt with is lack of feeling. I haven’t felt joy or enjoyment doing something in years. At most, it’s like, “Oh, I’d rather play video games than do absolutely nothing,” but I don’t feel enjoyment. I’ve been described as robotic at times. I have had many instances (like today) when I feel “flat.” I’m moving slowly and talking slowly, but I don’t feel depressed. 

I don’t know. I’m asking bc it’s been on my mind again, and sometimes I wonder if the reason that my depression is treatment-resistant (as diagnosed by my psychiatrist) is because I have something more going on.

,schizophrenia,"Hello and Happy New Year !  


I want to shine a light related to alogia and how do I get better over time. It was a long time since I suffered from this (like 4 years) and I was thinking to post here in case someone want to hear my story of recovery.  


Before my illness I was a quite guy but not that quieter. I used to spoke in medium sentences using the right amount of speech (not much but not little either like I used to say with alogia).  My alogia was mild says the doctors because I wasn't used sounds to comunicate only speaking in a short sentences such as yes or not or sometimes asking few question.  


  
Now I'm pretty much recovered when it comes to Alogia since I spoke like I used to before somethimes even better. For those who still struggles with alogia give it times and I believe that you can recover too. I tried severals pills to do that along with my doctor and afterone month on Piracetam my speech and toughts appears from nowhere. So I believe it's related to chemistry in our schizophrenic brain even if experts arren't sure yet. If you watch Living Well With Schizophrenia channel, Laurel says she was struggling with alogia throught out period of her illness and she clearly made a recovery.

Good luck everybody and I hope this post finds you well !

,schizophrenia,"(Diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar 2, suspected Autism)

Last night i missed my dose of abilify and i woke up at 6 am after an extremely off-putting dream. it felt very odd honestly and it gave very specific bad feeling.

After waking up, the room was very disorienting. Things kind of seemed 2D and the colors were very block-like. It felt like childhood sort of. I kept trying to shake the dream but very graphic flashes would keep popping up in my mind.

I then went to my bathroom and kept the lights open and played Tetris for a while since I saw a post on social media saying that playing it as long as possible after a traumatic event can lessen the impact and it sort of worked. The memory of the dream didn't really stay in my mind long-term.

I've been getting these sort of psychosis-like episodes more often lately even with the Abilify and I feel a little worried that it might be schizophrenia. Not that there's anything wrong with being diagnosed, but I do know it can be very debilitating.

Should I get myself checked? What next steps should I take? How do I lessen the frequency of having these episodes?

I find myself growing more and more paranoid that I'm losing my mind. What could be causing these sensations?

I'm specifically worried it may be schizophrenia since the ADHD and Bipolar symptoms can overlap.

,schizophrenia,"I had a lot of bursts of angriness, would have awful argument, being paranoid, and ended up losing tone of friends and losing family support. And then I would feel terribly humiliated and ashamed of being such an awful friend and human being. Some old friend even told me that I was the most self-untitled bitch she ever seen. This is what helped me the most to fight less and keep my friends.

**1st, it may be counterintuitive, but the first emotion you need to manage is not anger, it's shame.** Shame as an emotion is super toxic for your brain, and schizophrenic brain triggers an insane level of shame. Very few people talk about it, but shame is the emotion of schizophrenia, the same that sadness is the emotion of depression, and anxiety is the emotion of anxiety disorder. It means that it both aggravates your disease, AND is overproduced by your sick brain.

How to deal with shame, so that your brain can rest and produce less anger? Auto-compassion is the way to regulate shame. You can take a time for yourself, think about your experience of having all this shame and facing all these awful events and gives yourself the loving embrace a parent would give to a lost child. Tell yourself how much you understand that you are having a terrible time. You can hug a pillow against your chest while doing that, cry and imagining yourself as a child. If done properly, self-compassion can help you to move from shame and access guilt, which is a less toxic emotion and gives you the will to change. (Shame is more about wanting to hide and disappear, guilt is more about understanding you don't want to act not in accord with your values, and the truth is that you have great values, you don't want to have fight with your family and friends.) (Side note: shame can mutate in pride. It is super damaging for your relationship too. If you see yourself sliding in the ""I am superior"" mindset, take yourself back to self-compassion, acceptance and healthy guilt).

**2nd, how to regulate paranoia?** Paranoia is super tricky. I deal with it both with self-help stuff (like described here : [https://mind.help/topic/paranoia/coping/](https://mind.help/topic/paranoia/coping/)), direct communication (""I may be wrong, but I am afraid X, Y, Z is happening and it makes me feel angry and sad, I am right ?"") and by having some trustworthy people that are aware of my condition and help me to deal with people when I am paranoid. For example, I make my husband read my angry messages before sending them, he validates my anger and tells me when I am going too far. He is very good in non-violent communication and active listening, and de-escalate me when I am getting super angry against someone else. So, find the most emotionally intelligent person in your surroundings, be honest with them and ask them to call you out when you are getting paranoid. This is a difficult role. They must be super good in active listening, emotion validation, and boundaries setting.

**3rd, how to regulate anger?** Anger is an emotion that tell us that our space/boundaries is invaded. So, the easiest way to get it lower is to separate us physically from what makes us angry. If you feel you are too angry, just go away. Far. Far from the person, from your phone or computer if you are having online argument. Anger is also an emotion that is powerful and needs to be expressed. So write down how angry you are AND DONT SEND IT !!! It is only for your emotion to get out of your body. And also, last resort: the ""and then what ??"" game. Repeat yourself ""and then what ??"" until you don’t give a fuck about the situation. When you have done all of that, if still angry, examine if you need to express one boundary, and have the conversation in the nicest way possible.

**4th, how to repair?** A lot of people are not able to understand what we are going through, but some will and will accept our repair attempt. And know that in relationships, connecting after an argument is more important than not having arguments. Learn how to give proper apologies ([https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology) ). I lost many friends for ever at the beginning of my disease. But some family members that I have deeply hurt are now strong allies in my recovery. I also abandon the idea that everything is fixable. Some of my bad behaviors are not fixable, and I am ok with that. When I lose some friends, I go back to self-compassion and accept that my actions have consequences, even if caused by a terrible disease.

I still have anger issues, but less often, and life is getting easier as I progress in emotion regulation.

So, the easiest way to get it lower is to separate us physically from what makes us angry. If you feel you are too angry, just go away. Far. Far from the person, from your phone or computer if you are having online argument. Anger is also an emotion that is powerful and needs to be expressed. So write down how angry you are AND DONT SEND IT !!! It is only for your emotion to get out of your body. And also, last resort: the &amp;quot;and then what ??&amp;quot; game. Repeat yourself &amp;quot;and then what ??&amp;quot; until you don’t give a fuck about the situation. When you have done all of that, if still angry, examine if you need to express one boundary, and have the conversation in the nicest way possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4th, how to repair?&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people are not able to understand what we are going through, but some will and will accept our repair attempt. And know that in relationships, connecting after an argument is more important than not having arguments. Learn how to give proper apologies (&lt;a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology""&gt;https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology&lt;/a&gt; ). I lost many friends for ever at the beginning of my disease. But some family members that I have deeply hurt are now strong allies in my recovery. I also abandon the idea that everything is fixable. Some of my bad behaviors are not fixable, and I am ok with that. When I lose some friends, I go back to self-compassion and accept that my actions have consequences, even if caused by a terrible disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have anger issues, but less often, and life is getting easier as I progress in emotion regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
