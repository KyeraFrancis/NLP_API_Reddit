,Army," 

Hello,

I decided to share my experience and knowledge of REFRAD'n. Know that everyone's experience will be different, in my case I was an O3E getting out at 8 years. Here's what I learned:

THE PROCESS:

1. Receive your last OER and it's been submitted to HQDA/in your iPerms. Only matters if you plan on a DOD job where they'll ask for your OERs


2. 18 months out, you NEED to start SFL-TAP (only requires commander signature, not 2 levels up)


3. Once finished with SFL-TAP, take the CSP portion of the SFL-TAP courses. The CSP class is mandatory to part-take in a CSP which I recommend everyone try to do. 


4. Find a CSP you want to do, (3 letter agencies do have CSPs) it can also be any business/organization as long as it's not your immediate family's and you cannot be paid by the internship. If the CSP is not a known one to the DOD it will take longer, but that doesn't mean you can't do it. It can be anywhere up to 6 months and can only be done during your last 180 days of active duty.


5. Talk to the company. Get the company/organization to soft-select you and start CSP paperwork from the transitions office. You'll need to fill out the nformation, such as what you'll be doing and the layout of the internship. (This step takes 2 weeks for transitions to be approved and 2 weeks for legal review, SO START EARLY)


6. If you can't find a good CSP and still want to take advantage of it, apply for Cameron-Brooks, Alliance Careers, or any JMO recruiting organization. They have the fastest most streamlined processes for CSPs, it's all online and mostly helps you generally transition into the civilian workforce. Know that most of these are trying to place you in a corporate business since they receive money/benefits for finding and placing you. 


7. Simultaneously, as you're looking for a CSP and started the CSP paperwork, collect and submit your REFRAD packet. It will need Commander, BC, BDE signature and endorsement. Stay up to date on your CoC because they will ""lose"" and ""hold"" your paperwork to make you reconsider. (This step took me 8 months due to upper-level commanders waiting for CoCs to push it to the next guy, which made me restart from scratch as the signatures all had to be redone with new names).


8. REFRAD signed by BDE CMDR is only the first step, it needs to go to HQDA and your branch (make sure BDE S1 submits it to HQDA/Branch/Retirement Office) sometimes they'll just give you the packet and you'll assume they submitted it to your retirement office. Everyone has to ""vote"" to let you out and strength/manning, branch manager, board, etc. This process all the way to HQDA takes \~2 Months, so stay on top of where your packet is sitting. (Note: IPSS-A was not out while I did my REFRAD so it could be quicker now). (In my case specifically due to the ""brown-out"" my packet sat at branch/HQDA for about 5 months, which because I was now considered excess strength due to declining CCC, I was deployed downrange and didn't find out my REFRAD was accepted till 1/2 through the deployment).


9. While this is going on, GO TO THE DOCTOR. Whatever you plan on claiming with the VA must be on your military record. If you don't plan on claiming anything or feel/get told you're taking advantage, all I can say is the VA medical process is 100% your choice. No one can force you either way. The way I see it, it's your personal choice to decide whether you feel you were injured enough to seek medical treatment and it is to be documented that it occurred while serving. The VA needs 3 things for a successful claim. A. See doctor and issue recorded. B. Full Diagnosis. C. Treatment (must be ongoing/more than once). I recommend you read 38 CFR for whatever conditions you plan on claiming and it'll tell you the exact criteria needed for what percentages. Even if your issue doesn't rate any percentage, a 0% service-connected is still a VA disability (This can always be appealed as well), but make sure if you want to submit a claim to capture everything you want documented as service-connected. You only have 1 year after separating for the issue to be assumed service-connected, afterwards, it's extremely difficult to justify the issue and will need either Buddy Letters, DBQ, Sworn Statements, etc. 


10. Once your REFRAD gets back from HQDA and is fully approved, start your leave form, your CSP needs to be fully approved by this point too. 

11. Set your CSP for your last 6 months in the army. If you have leave, take it prior to the start of your CSP (don't sell it, you're losing money (BAH/BAS/COLA) if you do and if you go GS it counts against leave you want to sell as a government civilian in the future as there is a cap).

Example of the best case: 60 days of leave and 6-month CSP, need clearing papers 10 days prior to leave start date, clear the army, take leave, start CSP. Complete.

Example if not full 6 month CSP: 10 days clear army, 4-month CSP, 2 months of leave (can start a job during leave to get double pay). But know that if you have a 4-month CSP and say 65 days of leave, you won't be able to take those 5 days and will have to sell it. 


12. \*\*SUBMIT!!!\*\* Fully submit your VA claim at minimum 3 months from your separation date. If you miss it by even a day, you're going to wait a year+ to get your ratings and another 6+ months to get a paycheck. (You will be back paid assuming you receive a rating above 0%).


13. You need to plan this all out in order to know what day you're setting as your last day in the Army. Once you set it, it's a pain in the ass to change it and usually takes 2 months to change. So KNOW YOUR DATE after calculating CSP, Leave (include leave accrued during CSP and while on Leave), and clearing times.


14. Congrats, you completed the REFRAD process. 


15. Most important thing to note, no one gives a shit you're getting out. Almost none of your active duty (coworkers/bosses) personnel know the process of getting out because they haven't done it yet. They don't know what they're talking about and they most definitely don't give a shit about you getting out. Take control of your own process and don't let anyone bully you. Set your medical appointments and go, stop giving a shit if your boss is mad you're gone a lot, or if you receive profiles. The transitioning process is stressful and takes a lot of time/commitment (which is why a lot of my peers just end up staying). So do your due diligence and start planning now.

Notes: 

Once you have a separation date, here are 3 companies to join. Hiring our Heros (they will literally write your resume for you, give you mock interviews, or help you start a business) all for free. American Legion, a $45 entry fee, but if you need help with the VA process, they will assign you a VSO to help you submit your claim. Wounded Warrior Project, can also help submit your VA claim by assigning you a VSO, though it's harder and takes a lot longer for WWP to reply.

The 90 days after active duty Tricare is fake, don't believe it. Tricare removes you as a sponsor immediately, I've tried calling and getting added back in but to no avail. Have a plan for medical care and insurance, especially if you need follow-up appointments for your VA claim. Also if you need medication. (I have been without some of my necessary medications for a while now due to the long process of finding a PCP where I'm at).

AMEX Gold/Platinum, Chase Sapphire Reserve, and other credit cards. They know immediately once you're separated. They have a 3-month grace period for no annual fees so either have a plan to cancel or pay the fees. There's some good article about downgrading your cards as well. (NOTE: If you cancel your cards and you still have redemption points to spend, they will VANISH. Spend all your points prior to cancelation). SCRA for interest rates only applies WHILE ON active duty. If you have a card or student loan that is receiving an SCRA rate locked at 4%, it will go up to whatever the national average is (\~15%) so pay off your cards prior to getting out/student loans.

For the 10 years of federal service for student loan forgiveness, if you switch to a government civilian job (GS) that time will count. If you're a contractor, that time will not count. Have a plan for your TSP as you will need to roll it into something else if you don't plan on going GS. (Can be into a personal retirement fund account, or wherever you get hired at's 401K plan).

If you do want to go GS, buy back your time. Say you did 6 years, you can ""buy back"" that time into your GS pension, which is 100% worth it, but you will need to have money set aside to pay for it. Calculate it prior to transitioning. 

You can sign up for VGLI (similar to SGLI) up to 120 days after separating. I'd say it's a decent price for what you get, but the best part is they will not evaluate you for any medical conditions. So could be worth it depending on your situation. 

Once you separate, if they let you keep your CAC (the way to do this is to make sure you tell DEERs you're still in the IRR for however long you owe still), know that it deactivates in about a week after separation. If you have emails you want to save, do it now. If you get scanned at the gate with said CAC, they will take it. If you try to use the commissary, the card will not work. (If you did the VA steps correctly and received any disability, including 0% but service-connected, you will get a Veterans ID that allows you to use the MWR and Commissary). 

Create your DS Login and DON'T FORGET the password. Once your CAC deactivates the only way to sign into MyPay, MHS Genesis, iPerms, etc is with your DS Login.

LinkedIn has a free premium membership for active duty personnel for 1 year. I recommend using it as well as ZipRecruiter, and Cleared Jobs. That's how I found my current job. Check Silent Profesionals if you had a cool job while in. 

Also, if you are going to receive an ETS award, ask your CoC to do it early. I didn't receive mine till after my separation date and now I have a long process ahead of me to get it added to my DD214 (turning it into a DD215). For all you dirty priors, if you have old DD214s or ERBs, bring them with you when you have your DD214 day. It's the only form the clerks usually allow to input enlisted service data.

Lastly, Good Luck and Congratulations on your Transition! If you are on the fence about getting out, don't let the process deter you. My mentor put it this way, decide and weigh the good days vs the bad days. Once the bad days start to out-weigh the good, it's time to find something that makes you happy. ",t2_8a3dog1x,False,,0,False,REFRAD and Transitioning Trips and Tricks,[],r/army,False,7.0,,0,,,False,t3_18snz6z,False,dark,1.0,,public,7,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,False,self,1703756980.0,,[],{},,True,,1703747868.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

The VA needs 3 things for a successful claim. A. See doctor and issue recorded. B. Full Diagnosis. C. Treatment (must be ongoing/more than once). I recommend you read 38 CFR for whatever conditions you plan on claiming and it&amp;#39;ll tell you the exact criteria needed for what percentages. Even if your issue doesn&amp;#39;t rate any percentage, a 0% service-connected is still a VA disability (This can always be appealed as well), but make sure if you want to submit a claim to capture everything you want documented as service-connected. You only have 1 year after separating for the issue to be assumed service-connected, afterwards, it&amp;#39;s extremely difficult to justify the issue and will need either Buddy Letters, DBQ, Sworn Statements, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once your REFRAD gets back from HQDA and is fully approved, start your leave form, your CSP needs to be fully approved by this point too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set your CSP for your last 6 months in the army. If you have leave, take it prior to the start of your CSP (don&amp;#39;t sell it, you&amp;#39;re losing money (BAH/BAS/COLA) if you do and if you go GS it counts against leave you want to sell as a government civilian in the future as there is a cap).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of the best case: 60 days of leave and 6-month CSP, need clearing papers 10 days prior to leave start date, clear the army, take leave, start CSP. Complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example if not full 6 month CSP: 10 days clear army, 4-month CSP, 2 months of leave (can start a job during leave to get double pay). But know that if you have a 4-month CSP and say 65 days of leave, you won&amp;#39;t be able to take those 5 days and will have to sell it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;**SUBMIT!!!** Fully submit your VA claim at minimum 3 months from your separation date. If you miss it by even a day, you&amp;#39;re going to wait a year+ to get your ratings and another 6+ months to get a paycheck. (You will be back paid assuming you receive a rating above 0%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to plan this all out in order to know what day you&amp;#39;re setting as your last day in the Army. Once you set it, it&amp;#39;s a pain in the ass to change it and usually takes 2 months to change. So KNOW YOUR DATE after calculating CSP, Leave (include leave accrued during CSP and while on Leave), and clearing times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congrats, you completed the REFRAD process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most important thing to note, no one gives a shit you&amp;#39;re getting out. Almost none of your active duty (coworkers/bosses) personnel know the process of getting out because they haven&amp;#39;t done it yet. They don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re talking about and they most definitely don&amp;#39;t give a shit about you getting out. Take control of your own process and don&amp;#39;t let anyone bully you. Set your medical appointments and go, stop giving a shit if your boss is mad you&amp;#39;re gone a lot, or if you receive profiles. The transitioning process is stressful and takes a lot of time/commitment (which is why a lot of my peers just end up staying). So do your due diligence and start planning now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a separation date, here are 3 companies to join. Hiring our Heros (they will literally write your resume for you, give you mock interviews, or help you start a business) all for free. American Legion, a $45 entry fee, but if you need help with the VA process, they will assign you a VSO to help you submit your claim. Wounded Warrior Project, can also help submit your VA claim by assigning you a VSO, though it&amp;#39;s harder and takes a lot longer for WWP to reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 90 days after active duty Tricare is fake, don&amp;#39;t believe it. Tricare removes you as a sponsor immediately, I&amp;#39;ve tried calling and getting added back in but to no avail. Have a plan for medical care and insurance, especially if you need follow-up appointments for your VA claim. Also if you need medication. (I have been without some of my necessary medications for a while now due to the long process of finding a PCP where I&amp;#39;m at).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMEX Gold/Platinum, Chase Sapphire Reserve, and other credit cards. They know immediately once you&amp;#39;re separated. They have a 3-month grace period for no annual fees so either have a plan to cancel or pay the fees. There&amp;#39;s some good article about downgrading your cards as well. (NOTE: If you cancel your cards and you still have redemption points to spend, they will VANISH. Spend all your points prior to cancelation). SCRA for interest rates only applies WHILE ON active duty. If you have a card or student loan that is receiving an SCRA rate locked at 4%, it will go up to whatever the national average is (~15%) so pay off your cards prior to getting out/student loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the 10 years of federal service for student loan forgiveness, if you switch to a government civilian job (GS) that time will count. If you&amp;#39;re a contractor, that time will not count. Have a plan for your TSP as you will need to roll it into something else if you don&amp;#39;t plan on going GS. (Can be into a personal retirement fund account, or wherever you get hired at&amp;#39;s 401K plan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do want to go GS, buy back your time. Say you did 6 years, you can &amp;quot;buy back&amp;quot; that time into your GS pension, which is 100% worth it, but you will need to have money set aside to pay for it. Calculate it prior to transitioning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can sign up for VGLI (similar to SGLI) up to 120 days after separating. I&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s a decent price for what you get, but the best part is they will not evaluate you for any medical conditions. So could be worth it depending on your situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you separate, if they let you keep your CAC (the way to do this is to make sure you tell DEERs you&amp;#39;re still in the IRR for however long you owe still), know that it deactivates in about a week after separation. If you have emails you want to save, do it now. If you get scanned at the gate with said CAC, they will take it. If you try to use the commissary, the card will not work. (If you did the VA steps correctly and received any disability, including 0% but service-connected, you will get a Veterans ID that allows you to use the MWR and Commissary). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create your DS Login and DON&amp;#39;T FORGET the password. Once your CAC deactivates the only way to sign into MyPay, MHS Genesis, iPerms, etc is with your DS Login.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn has a free premium membership for active duty personnel for 1 year. I recommend using it as well as ZipRecruiter, and Cleared Jobs. That&amp;#39;s how I found my current job. Check Silent Profesionals if you had a cool job while in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you are going to receive an ETS award, ask your CoC to do it early. I didn&amp;#39;t receive mine till after my separation date and now I have a long process ahead of me to get it added to my DD214 (turning it into a DD215). For all you dirty priors, if you have old DD214s or ERBs, bring them with you when you have your DD214 day. It&amp;#39;s the only form the clerks usually allow to input enlisted service data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Good Luck and Congratulations on your Transition! If you are on the fence about getting out, don&amp;#39;t let the process deter you. My mentor put it this way, decide and weigh the good days vs the bad days. Once the bad days start to out-weigh the good, it&amp;#39;s time to find something that makes you happy. &lt;/p&gt;

Well, the menu that allows you to submit absence is throwing an error.

Good enough for government work I guess.

I'm imagining the first week after block leave when our S1 guy comes back unable to login due to yet even more conveniently ""scheduled maintenance"".

I am a reservist deploying June 1 per mobilization orders. I have had Tricare Reserve Select(TRS) for a long time and have paid my premiums through June 1. My unit S1 runs me for early Tricare Prime on March 1 which is when I am put on a manning document. I was not aware about this as on previous long-term ADOS orders, I only got Tricare Prime when the orders started. However due to Tricare cycle, Tricare does not reflect Prime until April 1. Milconnect has a letter on April 1 saying I was no longer eligible for TRS as of March 1. Unfortunately, I don't realize it until May 1 when I checked my Tricare Humana beneficiary portal as I routinely do. I don't check milconnect that often.

Problem is I started out of network physical therapy on March 15 to take care of minor pains and aches. Out of network care is much better than in-network. So when the PT office and Tricare sync up, I am still on TRS. After talking to both my PT office AND Tricare Humana, I am now liable for out of pocket costs for the 15-20 PT visits I had from March 15 to May 1 to both PT and Humana which is like $2k. While I have been paying my copay, the PT claims never processed.

,Army,"Hello! Tell me if I am utterly screwed or if I am showing symptoms, please.

Nitty Gritty:

I just passed ten years of service in the reserve. I have one deployment in the past and a med board that followed four years later that cleared me to stay in.

I did three years of therapy, talked all the feelings out, and felt a lot better mentally. I submitted a VA claim somewhere in there and received 60% for a generalized stress and anxiety disorder, tinnitus, and shoulder surgery with a LOD. 

Fun Facts: 

I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder a couple of years after my first deployment, hence the med-board. However, they cleared me after my psychologist reassessed me and diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. 

The following year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Again, news to me, I have been in for eight years at this point and am shitting myself on what was going to happen to me. 

I got kicked off a deployment about two weeks ago and was going to leave soon. I was told I might be medically separated or retired since I am at 60% disability and have much time in service.

Question:

Can I be dishonorably or other than honorably discharged for this?

Should I expect to lose my VA disability or retirement benefits?

I am anxious about it since these both occurred in service well into my career, and I planned on doing my 20 years before leaving. Now, I'm about to lose it all when I was planning on deploying and taking pride in my service and growth. 

The other shitty thing is my lizard brain is saying, ""Well, that stuff was definitely made worse with service, so go refile with VA.""

SW: 235lbs
GW: 170-165lbs
Height: 5’5 ft.

I’m here to get advice and do some research. I intend to post this post in the weight loss/fitness community too, but figured I could try to ask here as well.

I am 22 years old. I am graduating this month with a certified diploma, but want to use this new year to get my ass in gear and start a cut to get fit and ready for enlistment. I’ve spoken to the Army and Marine Corps recruiters, and they are encouraging me to do a few workouts with them and even come get weighed in/taped at the end of every month till I meet their standards. Currently I am researching the pros and cons of each branch before making a in stone decision.

Now, until I reach a certain weight, running/rucking isn’t in motion just yet, but calisthenics and weight lifting is. I wanted to see if anyone could give me advice on which workout routine worked for them? I am looking at a Hybrid Split, but I’ve also heard about PPL x Arnold and 5x5.

The hardest part about my commitment is the nutritional side, I want to hit a high protein calorie deficit, but I work a 5am - 3pm labor job M-F. So F-M are my gym days, so does anyone have any advice on meal prep or anything to help hit my goals?

I’m just in need of any advice or tips, so feel free to throw in your workout routines, your diet plans, supplements, hell, even extra stuff I should know before enlistment. Please and thank you.

&lt;p&gt;Am I unique in this? Should I have my medication adjusted? Does anyone else deal with the sort of surprise from family and friends? Is it right that I just accepted that as much of a pain in the ass as it is that this is just now a normal part of my life as it has been for the past 15 years or so?&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"I am going through a really confusing time and need some support. 

I have been diagnosed Bipolar a handful of times the past decade. Along with Bipolar, I’m also diagnosed with C-ptsd, Panic Disorder, GAD, OCD, Depression, and ADHD. 

Over the past five years, I’ve tried many meds, but haven’t found my combo yet. 

I’d like to point out that I felt extremely frustrated with my first psychiatrist as she would put me on a med (Depakote for example) which would decrease my anxiety, ocd, mania but would increase my depression. Instead of putting me on an additional med to treat the depression, she would just take me off Depakote entirely. This scenario happened with multiple meds. She refused to let me take more than one. So please understand my exhaustion as I feel I should be on a combo of meds by now. 

So I see a new psychiatrist. This guy almost caused me to commit suicide. He put my on Zoloft alone and said we would add a mood stabilizer once I adjusted. I called him so many times the 3 weeks I was on Zoloft saying I was having intrusive thoughts of harming myself and he said, I kid you not, “I’ve never heard of Zoloft causing this. All of my patients have been successful on it.” This made me feel like I was crazy and I ended up at the ER. They took me off the Zoloft and sent me home. The side effects last for over a month until I rebalanced. Honestly traumatizing. 

Months later, I’m ready to try again. Next psychiatrist is actually great. He is the one that diagnosed me with ADHD which was a new one. Unfortunately my insurance changed, so I had to go to yet another psychiatrist before him and I could even get started.

So here we are at my fourth psychiatrist. She has ONE appointment with me and declares that I am not bipolar or adhd. Instead, she insists that it’s just anxiety and ptsd. She tried lithium anyway. I respond poorly. Then she puts me on an antidepressant and I got a brutal manic episode. So I stop taking that immediately before we have a repeat of the Zoloft situation. 

So now I’m afraid to see her again. We’ve had 3 appointments and at each appointment I’ve tried to desperately explain that I do have Bipolar. She won’t listen. 

Has anyone ever been diagnosed Bipolar and have a new doctor try to deny that? Or have you ever had doctors that won’t do med combos right away?

,bipolar,"Hi to whoever reads this

I am 18 and for a very long time I have shown very clear symptoms of being bipolar, and have even undergone a prolonged sort of schizoaffective or manic episode last year that had resulted in me being kicked out of school and legally required to be in therapy until I am reported no longer a danger to myself and others.

My parents think I've done all of that for attention because I've learnt how to help myself and eased my symptoms (in the sense that my episodes last shorter and do less damage to me and those around me.) In general, they deject any concept of me being mentally ill and specifically my dad claims that the reason for things like me informing school about my mental health issues for privileges such as extra examination time have all only been for pity.

Recently I cut off a friend who was extremely abusive. They weren't diagnosed but they were very clearly borderline and I was their 'FP' and when I had cut them off things went to shit when they were on their way to attempting in front of their entire family because I left, and soon my parents found out. My mom had been on my side and was very understanding of all my reasons but my dad on the other hand had said all the wrong points such as comparing my episode and theirs and saying that I had done it as a stupid mistake for pity while they deserve genuine empathy because they are mentally ill. I've truly never been more frustrated in my life because not only did this friend really destroy me and my other friends' mental health, but have they also somehow gained my dad's sympathy when I never have. Why does my dad refuse to believe me? We always withdraw from therapy before I can continue with a doctor long enough to be diagnosed, I have gone to 3-4 different doctors but each of them I'd only have a session or two with and that would always be a result of some horrible episode I had and my parents would see that since the episode is over or has calmed that I'm able to withdraw from therapy, only for me to have to be put back in again.

All my psychiatrist's notes are incomplete and all over the place. My document is so messy. I personally don't care about going to therapy because again, I've done so much for so long to make sure I can (to an extent, yes I still have insane outbursts) control my actions even if I can't control my thoughts.) and in addition to that the costs of therapy, medication, diagnosis papers are insane here. But I am so sick of this conversation topic constantly being brought up about how I want to be mentally ill and how the only thing I have is 'mental complications' in his words, because he views mental illness as an extreme. I don't get it, do I just go along with it and call myself stupid and immature like he calls me so we can just avoid this conversation? I get so sickeningly frustrated that it has sent me into extreme episodes over and over again, and I'm really scared it's making me worse again because I'm in my last year of school and just want to get it over with safely instead of having to be removed again from school premises for being a danger to myself or others, and it would be a repeated offense.",t2_cx2bwaqf5,False,,0,False,My dad never believes me,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Rant '}, {'a': ':angry-cry:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/kns090pd89za1_t5_2qnv4/angry-cry'}]",r/bipolar,False,,,0,,,True,t3_18t1602,False,light,1.0,#3bbed5,public,1,0,{},,6a08e3cc-6943-11ed-9266-52e02661766c,False,[],,False,False,,{},Rant :angry-cry:,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Diagnosis Pending'}]",{},,True,,1703788935.0,richtext,,,,richtext,self.bipolar,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi to whoever reads this&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"Hello, again!

I’m afraid I don’t really know how Reddit is supposed to work — I made my account only a few days ago and r/bipolar was the first community I joined.

I have always had trouble communicating ‘how I’m doing’ and I was harshly reminded of that when I met up with some old friends yesterday. My first full-blown mania was about a year ago and it was pretty clear to basically everyone who knew me at the time that I was going through something.

Naturally, my friends wanted to know how I was doing and somewhat correctly guessed that getting me drunk was the only way to get me to open up.

As you might’ve guessed, that didn’t go well, and instead of my friends feeling relieved or reassured knowing ‘what’s really going on,’ I’m afraid they just think I’m crazy or something. Nothing bad happened in particular, I was just very vague and a little morbid — I have PTSD symptoms as well and it’s very hard to talk about my mental health without hiding behind clinical jargon. I feel more separated from my friends than before, really, and I feel like such a freak. I wish I could have ‘normal’ human problems.

Anyways, I’m not letting that get me down (by and large, I’m doing quite well actually) and I wanted to share this on here to chat with other bipolar folks about this kinda stuff.

,bipolar,"Hi guys....it's my first time posting. I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar but I have a feeling I might be soon and atm depression is hitting pretty hard and I would like to feel less alone.

I've always felt like two people in one. Got pretty bad depression at least once a year ever since puberty, followed by elevated mood and drive. During these ""good mood"" periods my dreams and aspirations would pull me forward. My dreams of acting, playwrighting and working in theatre in general.

About a year ago I took mdma with a friend and at first everything was fine. Until I realised it had probably triggered a severe depressive episode. I was almost completely unable to function. I would burst out crying no matter what I was doing, lost all hope etc etc.

I was put on SSRIs and it worked..i got better a lot quicker..i could feel myself become manic and decided to taper off of the meds without my GP because I thought ""i had it under control"". I didn't. Long story short, I dropped out of uni, embarassed myself, hurt a bunch of people and am in debt now.

Up until recently it was again the thought of my dreams pulling me forward. I was planning to put on a play I've written and was working towards that.

Until my depression hit me again like a truck..out of the blue, all my desire to write or work towardw my dreams has evaporated. I again feel like I'm this different person..i barely care about anything..i just wanna stay in bed.
I was visiting family and am back at the airport and to stop myself from freaking out and crying I'm thinking about how I can vape again when i've landed. It's really sad how my nicotine addiction is the thing I look forward to most right now.

I feel incredibly stupid for thinking I was healed when I was in fact manic. It makes me think all that happiness was an illusion, all my dreams were bullshit. How can I ever view anything with certainity in life? While i was manic i kept thinking ""i can't be manic, i still sleep enough"" i was so certain i was doing fine, all the while behaving completely irratic.

I feel like I can never take on responsibility in life because I tried starting a business during mania and now the thought of ever doing that makes me want to vomit from anxiety.

I'm waiting to hear back from my GP to get referred to a therapist again..until then just holding on.

I started lithium last February (after having had bipolar 2 for 4 years). Within weeks, I’ve noticed that these traits are a lot stronger than they had previously been. I seem more autistic, to the point that a psych ward admission over the summer suggested that I have it and meet the criteria for a diagnosis (in addition to bipolar 2).

One could argue that lithium is the medication that has made me feel most like myself, and so these traits are stronger than when I was on quetiapine or aripiprazole, for example.

I am more rigid in the way I think, less able to adapt to change, more sensitive to other medications and cannot pick up on social cues at all. My partner has noticed this about me too.

I was 25 and 26 during the pandemic, and I feel that those 2 years stopped me from enjoying ""being in my 20s"". Also, birthdays have been a strange thing since I turned 19. That year, almost no one showed up when I celebrated it, so I pretty much stopped doing it. I only have a small dinner with my family and my girlfriend, and sometimes a friend. Ironically, my ""happy place"" is always when I turned 21, with my gf's head in my shoulder, my best friend in front of me, and my family around me. 

I always love to celebrate my GF's birthday in particular, and always make a point of calling everyone I care about for theirs. I don't always get the same treatment back, so that also sours me a bit, and has made me not care about it. A part of me says that it's nice to be celebrated for a day, but another part says that it's just one more day and nothing so special.

,bipolar,"I included in my Craigslist post that I have an ESA. Thought it would help me find a place to rent. Wish I didn’t

I found a perfect room with a great roommate. I’m moving out of the area and we sent each-other voice notes back and forth and FaceTimed for 2 hours. It’s an ideal situation and perfect price.

The landlord said I can rent with my pets . But bc she remembered I said I have an ESA, he asked for the letter. Now after weeks of talking I have to share my ESA letter than says I have bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.

I just sent the letter and also a long text explaining how bipolar affects me and how it won’t be an issue.

Wow, this sucks.
She has a son so I’m thinking she will think nope not around my son.

I said I can offer a letter of reference for my old roommate and that im happy to answer any questions I have.

,bipolar,"i love being bipolar when im manic, i hate it the other 98% of the time. why cant i have something thats easier to fucking deal with????????? like if i was just depressed ALL the time at least id get USED to being depressed eventually. but these fuckin episodes... i never get used to them. it's unbearable every single fuckin time.

i haven't had a depressive episode this long or this severe in... who knows, probably over a year i guess... but rn it feels like the worst thing ive ever experienced.

for context, im between jobs right now. i have nothing to do with my life and its awful. no distractions. nothing. 

i never thought myself an alcoholic. ive been addicted to damn near everything you dont consume intravenously, and never alcohol. i could never allow myself to drink more than 2 days in a row because it makes my body feel awful. but... ive spent like 100 dollars on alcohol this week and its wednesday. ive been going through a 12 pack of beer a day plus another 6 at night and each beer is topped to the brim with vodka. cheap, disgusting vodka. i figured out that 1. if you feel like shit no matter what, a hangover isnt even a detectable difference. and 2. more alcohol usually fixes the hangover. it also makes it worse when you finally let it happen, but it puts it off for a while.  

it started because i havent slept in a while. i havent really gotten out of bed or eaten, but i havent slept either. ive never been much of an insomniac. i love sleeping, and its usually easy. ive literally never experienced this before. i used to take insane amounts of adderall to keep myself awake when i had shit to get done and even then id end up taking a nap here and there because i love sleep and i do NOT function well without it. so, i got frustrated at my inability to sleep and the only thing guaranteed to make me pass out is getting really really fucking drunk. so after 2 days of no sleep, i said fuck it. i bought an 18 pack and whipped out the shooters that have been sitting in the back of my freezer for god knows how long. and i went through the majority of the 18 pack that night... i think i set a new record for how much alcohol i can consume in a 6 hour period and live. and i didnt sleep. at all. 

so when 8 am rolled around and i was still awake i just popped another fucking bottle open. i mean, fuck it, why not? what do i have to fucking lose?

my friend gave me a lecture after a couple days of being constantly borderline blacked out and saying a bunch of stupid shit to everyone. they told me how concerning it is that im acting like this, how far theyve seen me come and how im throwing it all down the drain because im depressed. they told me they cannot bear to watch me slowly kill myself yet again. they said they worry so much, because if i die, they probably wouldnt know right away, probably not until days later, maybe weeks. they said im the one thing that stays constant in their life, and they cant bear to lose that. 

they showed up at my house yesterday. i think it was yesterday. i wasnt replying to their texts because i was ashamed about the shit i did the night before. anyways, they just walked in. they walked in and i heard my door open so i stumbled out of my room, off the bed thats stacked with empty bottles that i dont care to throw away because the trash is too full and i dont have the energy to take it out. they saw me, in week old pajamas i havent cared to change, radiating the stench of stress sweat and alcohol. and before they said anything, i opened a beer and passed it to them, an unconscious act of hospitality. then i saw the look on their face. 

it wasnt an intervention, we just talked about life. it was nice. weve been through some shit together. weve attempted together. so i have no restriction when i tell them how shit my life is going, and they listen. they always listen. i love them for that. they talked about their goals, and thats when i realized i have no goals anymore. i dont know what im doing, why im here, nothing seems to mean enough for me to commit to it anymore. i have nothing to strive for, really. ive never had an episode thats lasted this long.. since september, at least. it sucked seeing my friend, who i spent years pulling out of their own rut, doing so well... and im like this. ive disappointed them. 

i get up every morning and tell myself ""today is the day i get my shit together. today is the day i muster up the motivation to fix my shit and be better."" and then i take a bunch of stimulants to give me the motivation to get out of bed but all it gives me is heart palpitations and sore eyes. motivation for what? honestly. whats anything worth? im waiting to fuckin die. its frustrating, because life is so worth living when im not depressed and i KNOW that, but that doesnt change how i feel when i AM depressed. 

i think ive gotten 5 hours of sleep this past week. not since monday, i mean in the last 7 days. i try so hard. i turn off all my screens and sit in silence or give myself some kind of ambient background noise and then... i stare at the backs of my eyelids for hours. hours until i give up and decide to try to drug myself to sleep. and then im just awake AND on drugs and ive gained nothing and lost my sanity. 

i went through my old journals and my instagram archives looking for motivation for myself, trying to find inspiration for what i was like back when i wasnt miserable. but, what i found is that... ive always been miserable. ive been dealing with the same things for as long as i have records of it and definitely before that. i havent gotten better. ive certainly gotten worse in some ways, more severe. but never actually better. i havent changed. i dont know if i can. not because i think humans are incapable of changing, but because i personally cant keep the motivation. when im good im very good, but when im bad im better. i like doing good... till i get bored of it, or my goals lose momentum. 

a friend spent the night with me llast night. i love this friend because they dont expect anything from me, they love me just as i am, the good, the bad, and the terrible. i thought that maybe i couldnt sleep because i recently broke up with my ex and now i sleep in a cold, empty bed. i hate sleeping alone. so i thought maybe having someone with me would help. but it didnt. i just kinda embarrassed myself with my drunkenness instead. and far after they passed out, i layed awake next to them, opening beer after beer, each time topped with skol, in silence. silence and darkness. and when they woke up, i still hadnt slept, it was 11 am. they never voiced that they were concerned or disappointed or anything, but i was disappointed. theres no good reason for me to burden all my friends with my dysfunction. theres no reason to make them worry about me. i mean, im not suicidal or anything, i dont really have the option to be. im not gonna die, im just being terrible for the time being. 

i havent eaten in a while. my body doesnt want to eat. everything looks disgusting, nauseating. the only thing it wants is more alcohol. i cant do that to myself. i cant. i also cant afford to, financially. but i wake up and i feel like shit and the only thing that makes feeling like shit tolerable is alcohol. 

i was invited to a new years party. i was told to ""please not fuck with the vibes"". dont know how thats gonna happen, but id rather spend my new year away from my disgusting house. ill probably end up getting kicked out of the party. maybe thatll be my wake up call or something. but everything i think will be a wake up call or a new low or fucking whatever just ends up turning into another day, another fuck up. life may or may not go on. its fine. 

life would be cool if meds worked, but it kinda wouldnt, because the constant reminder that i need a cocktail of pills to force myself into normalcy is my own personal nightmare. ill take my drugs voluntarily to get high, thank you very much. plus, i build tolerance too fast. i end up on the max dose of a medication within a year of starting it, and they all just stop working after a while. whats the point in taking meds if theyre not gonna work forever, or even a significant amount of time?  

i guess its gonna be another day with no sleep, thats how its feeling anyways. i wish i felt tired. i wish i felt anything human. i feel like that story ""the girl from the other side"". i feel like ive been touched by an outsider and im slowly losing everything that makes me human. i mean, i dont even enjoy anything anymore. literally anything. the friend who spent the night last night brought their fancy drawing tablet to try to motivate me to put my emotions into art like i used to. it didnt work. i have no motivation or inspiration to create. i want to sleep. 

every time i go through a depressive episode i think its the worst one yet, but in all reality, theyre always terrible, just in different ways. i wish i knew which type of terrible an episode was gonna be so i could prepare myself for it. 

i wanna clean my house before the new year, i know itll help me. shitty external environment means shitty internal environment. cleaning always helps, i just wish i wasnt too tired to do it. i havent folded my laundry in 4 months.

i suppose im asking for advice, or support, or understanding, or... anything, really.

,bipolar,"Hi yall

I’ve dealt with depression since my teens but was officially diagnosed with bipolar 2 in 2020.

The holidays usually aren’t too terrible for me (26F), but this year has been the worst by far. Both of my parents have passed in the last 7 years and I dont have family by me. I have a partner, but he isn’t big into the holidays. Pretty tight money wise right now, so couldn’t celebrate if we wanted to. 

I haven’t taken my meds since Friday. I usually take them to work with me so I don’t forget to take them, but then I sometimes don’t take them over the weekends because they’re in my work bag, and out of sight out of mind. That’s what happened this weekend. Usually it doesn’t impact me too much. 

Well Christmas Day I had the darkest thoughts I’ve ever had. Thinking (mid-hug) that my partner would enjoy this potential last memory of us together. Stopped myself from crying so he wouldn’t know I was struggling. Convinced myself that I shouldn’t reach out for help because it’s about time I do something for myself and that I wouldn’t be around for the worst part anyway. Etc. pretty shitty thoughts. 

I happened to have taken an edible (legal here) an hour or so before all of that and it put me to sleep, so nothing happened.

Yesterday I woke up feeling just about the same. Not as scary of thoughts, though. Went to work and went back home within an hour because of how depressed I was feeling. Called off today for the same feelings.

As of right now I’m still feeling depressed, but I don’t want to take my meds. I know it’s not unusual to not want to take them. I know they would fix it. But damn I don’t want to. 

I dont want to tell anyone I didn’t take them. I’ll just look like a failure and a dumbass because I’m not doing the one thing that could literally save my life. I hate this feeling more than I can describe. 

As of right now I don’t want to start my meds back up again. I’d rather end up at the hospital or something. I don’t think I’m being logical. I don’t know what to do. 

I’m sorry, this is more of a rant than anything. I’m hoping someone in here understands because I don’t think anyone in my life would.

,bipolar,"Hi All,

Hoping to get some feedback, sorry for the essay. 

I had an incident today where a pharmacist denied me my meds. My prescriber sent them in early with a note that I can get them early to avoid problems with the holiday. Insurance ok’d it, no big deal. I called yesterday to confirm with the pharmacy, “all good they’ll be ready tomorrow.” Went to pick them up, she said “you should have plenty. I’m not filling it 5 days early. Come back when it’s three days early.” I said I’m sorry but my doctor and insurance cleared it, I don’t understand. She said well I’m personally not going to fill it because you’re being argumentative. I pulled out my phone, recorded the whole thing, argued without being unkind, and left. I absolutely pointed out that Kroger has no right to come between me, my prescriber, and my insurance. Fell on deaf ears, and they called my doc who asked me to come in. 

I was upset at the interaction not because it was an inconvenience, but because in my head that irresponsible behavior is the same that can kill, or like the stories you hear about a sexual assault victim who is denied Plan B by a pharmacist when she leaves the ER. 

I know that Pharm. D’s have that power. It’s just never happened to me, and seemed so preposterous that I just stood there with the store manager and the pharmacist asking to please explain why. Again, she said “I’m personally not doing it because you are being argumentative.”

I went to the doc, and felt pretty ashamed because I didn’t have the foresight to realize she was going to be pulled into it. My therapist came in too and just looked disappointed. They were both just worried that my mania was kicking up and were not upset in the slightest. I apologized, left, and feel horrible. 

Mania for me is difficult because I’m usually the last to find out I’m in it. But now I’m in this merry-go-round of ok so do I never call people out when they violate my values and principals? Is this just mania or maybe a combo of onset and poor judgement?

Do I just go on practicing letting go because I can’t tell the difference between standing up for myself and losing control?

Sorry for the rant. I don’t know how to make this up to anyone besides just staying off their radars for a while. Definitely not apologizing to the pharmacist….

I got on medication at the beginning of November and I've been trying to rebuild the relationship.


Things were going good until I had an episode today.


I decided to spy on her on the cameras (shouldn't have done that in the first place that's where my fuck up started) 
I over heard her talking to another man on the phone who had apparently called to talk to her about gastric surgery.  
The part of the conversation I heard set me off I assumed she was cheating and I flipped out and did something crazy... I locked her out of our business accounts which I know is wrong and I know I shouldn't have done that but I convinced myself I was in the right. 


She hates me as a person. 

She told me there's nothing left to hold onto in this relationship. That I've burned everything to the ground and then stomped on the ashes. The worst part is that she isn't wrong. That's exactly what I've done.

I think I've been having a manic episode, but it's duller than it used to be. I'm doing things I shouldn't be doing I'm not fully in control of my emotions I was feeling so stable just a few days ago but now I'm back to being the same old me and I don't like that person.

&lt;p&gt;Things were going good until I had an episode today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to spy on her on the cameras (shouldn&amp;#39;t have done that in the first place that&amp;#39;s where my fuck up started) 
I over heard her talking to another man on the phone who had apparently called to talk to her about gastric surgery.&lt;br/&gt;
The part of the conversation I heard set me off I assumed she was cheating and I flipped out and did something crazy... I locked her out of our business accounts which I know is wrong and I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t have done that but I convinced myself I was in the right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She hates me as a person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She told me there&amp;#39;s nothing left to hold onto in this relationship. That I&amp;#39;ve burned everything to the ground and then stomped on the ashes. The worst part is that she isn&amp;#39;t wrong. That&amp;#39;s exactly what I&amp;#39;ve done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ve been having a manic episode, but it&amp;#39;s duller than it used to be. I&amp;#39;m doing things I shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing I&amp;#39;m not fully in control of my emotions I was feeling so stable just a few days ago but now I&amp;#39;m back to being the same old me and I don&amp;#39;t like that person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel lost right now and could use some advice how does everyone else manage to not blow up the things they care about? Am I the only one who convinces themselves of things that are blatantly untrue?&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"I'd been very stable for about five years on my meds, with diagnoses of PTSD, ADHD, depression and anxiety. But I felt TOO stable, very flat, so about a month and a half ago, my psych put me on the antidepressant Viibryd.

I thought I was doing fantastically, honestly. In my job, I felt so motivated to get better in my field, especially since I had just received a negative performance evaluation--I felt like I finally had the willpower and drive to perform superbly at my job. Personally, I finally felt driven to get my life together--make that dentist appointment, make a budget, organize my apartment, get different things I'd been procrastinating on DONE. 

Sure, I was feeling paranoid. My thoughts were racing and even though I wanted to research more about my field, I couldn't organize my thoughts well enough to make any headway. I was agitated beyond belief, getting enraged at my brother (whom I share an apartment with) almost daily. The medication was giving me nightmares, and I couldn't sleep for more than two hours before waking up in a cold sweat, terrified. 

But I could work a full eight hours without getting tired! I stood up for myself in a situation in which I would normally have just stuck my head in the ground! I felt happy in my personal life and engaged at work...

This past Friday, my psych diagnosed me with Bipolar II. The Viibryd had kicked off a hypomanic episode. I had to stop the Viibryd immediately and start on the antipsychotic Vraylar, tapering off of the Abilify I'd been on.

I have a 10-day break from work, thank God, because otherwise I don't know how I'd cope. I'm okay in the mornings, but by the afternoons, I am a sobbing wreck. I feel such a sense of loss. I had so many dreams that felt so close and so real, if only for a couple of weeks. I felt like I had so many problems in my life, but I was finally energetic and driven enough to tackle them successfully. I felt like I knew what I actually wanted to do with my life, further myself in this field, instead of thinking about other fields or career paths I could be on. I felt confident I could handle life, for the first time in a decade. 

And now it's all...gone. I'm back to where I was before. Well, worse--when I stabilize again, I'll probably feel flat; able to handle life, but just barely, and forget about truly *enjoying* it. I won't get ahead on my responsibilities like I felt I might have been able to while hypomanic. I'll continue to slowly drown in financial ruin and just plain ol' apathy about life. I won't make any dreams come true, not only because I'll be too apathetic, but also because I don't even know what my dreams are anymore. 

How do you bounce back from this? I guess understanding my experience as being ""bipolar"" is new to me--I guess I feel like what I'm feeling right now is my new reality, when it's really ""just"" a depressive episode. I just feel like I'm grieving the future I thought I might have, that I thought Viibryd was giving me, that was really just hypomanic, anxious energy. And now, looking back, what I thought was two years of happiness in college, followed by two years of depression, was likely just bipolar symptoms. Maybe my ""happiness"" in college never really was. Maybe it was just hypomania. Maybe I just have to learn to accept that flatness is the best I can hope for from life.

,bipolar,"I got my currently job on September of this year after a clusterfuck hiatus down spiral bullshit that happened during my last job where I end up hospitalized and unemployed for over 3 months.

I’m a registered nurse. This would be my first job acting as such. Before I had worked on other clinical settings but as a student or an assistant nurse. I was glad of having the opportunity more so because the initial gig was too good to be true. Then I got kicked out of my first role and forced to do something I didn’t want to and hate.

Three months in and I always try not to dwell on it. Try to change mi mindset every day to the fact that I’m learning a bunch of different things that otherwise I wouldn’t, that I live 15 mins from work and that I don’t expect to be there more than a year or two.

It is hard, very hard. So hard that there’s been days where I had to call in because I was in crisis. It has been hell for me to comply with my meds regime because of the crazy hours and too much to do to even stop for taking them plus they were making me have tremors and I hated it because patients would get scare and think that I was being nervous.


Calling in just got me into trouble now with Human Resources being concern of my repetitive absences. I tried to explain it to my supervisor and let them know that I can’t always provide evidence since my issue is a mental health condition and my doctors won’t be available to me unless I have an appointment which has been a pain in the ass to get one lately because I assume they are on vacation.

I haven’t been able to enjoy the holidays. Didn’t decorate or celebrated shit because I’ve been having rough days lately. I was only looking forward to New Year’s Eve because I was going to be off the next day and that’s gone as well. I just woke up with a message from my supervisor telling that he had to change my shift to a night one because people already called in sick for New Year’s. I was furious because I find it unfair for many reasons including him allowing it from so early and because I had already shared my mental health issues with him and instead of picking someone else he chose me. 

Of course I felt pressure to accept it because of my current situation with HR and because I’m new. But I’m not having a great year at all and certainly hope I could celebrate the fucker away with a bang and cant even do that.

Is so hard to explain yourself and what you’re going through without them believing you’re irresponsable or lazy. This whole shit has drained me to the point where now my body is manifesting physical symptoms.

Add oil to a fire

If I light up perhaps they won’t leave me

Harm of flopping like a fish in dry air

All I need is a snare to mistake for support 

Meet and dissolve with a ghost

Get worked up when I lie to myself

Never ill—just tore a gill and I can’t get up the fall

Won’t you peck at me?

Claw me like a monster

Call it help

Netted in a cow catcher

Frantic to have gills wet

When no support around

So bloated

You a tick to me

I feel like disease 

People don’t want my name

Just something to bleed

Unfair deal

Why must I be the one situated in need?

Only got heard when I folded like a chair

Polished knees

Branches with leaves are heading to dead and don’t bend but break

Better if stranded that tethered to another’s totem

Sometimes feel accepted when I’m treated as a bulletin board

Lonely on a steppe with no clan to claim

Get cornered when vulnerable

Polished as a floor

Sediments falling as confetti

Meshed to it 

Like combines over me to be taken off

Tear like cloth

Wrapped on branches as a charm

To cook and rattle as a snake 

Cannibalizing

I stopped getting my period around the time I had spinal surgery July 2022. I was very worried and went to my obgyn. They did a blood test and saw that my prolactin levels were off the charts. They recommended an MRI, but because I was on disability with no insurance yet, I couldn't get it done and I was discharged from the practice.

Lately I have been doing some research and found that Risperidone could cause lack of period. I stopped it cold turkey (I know) because I was scared, and when we retested my blood, prolactin was at a much safer range even though it was still very high.

Yesterday I was astounded to find that I got my period back!!! It's been a month off Risperidone.

,bipolar,"Me (32F) and my bf (31M) have been together for 3 years, living together for 6 months, and this summer we decided to get married. Our wedding is scheduled for April next year.

I was diagnosed bipolar when I was 16, and I have been suicidal for the last 7 years or so. When I was 16, I started a 7 year on and off relationship with someone who lied a lot and tried to manipulate me, and that relationship really changed me in a very negative way and affected my relationships ever since.

I agreed to marry my bf because I was absolutely sure that I would kill myself one day, and I wanted my bf to inherit my house. This has to do with the laws in our country but your partner is not your heir unless you are legally married and you cannot freely dispose of everything you own in a will. The house we live is mine (I have a mortgage, but I paid the down payment all alone), and I'm doing well financially but he is not.

I was never in love with my boyfriend, but I do love him; I started a relationship with him because I was lonely and I think he was lonely too. He is a kind hearted, supportive person. We have the same sense of humor and we share one specific interest, but that's it. I'm a bit of brainy person and I can't have any deep conversation with him because he sees the world in black and white terms and he doesn't read or try to learn. He's in a low paid job and believes he'll only advance in life if he wins the lottery. He lived with his parents until he was 31 and he never did any chores. He's still a bit hopeless around the house. He has his chores that he does half-assed so momma (me) doesn't scold him. He can't do a load of laundry or fix a lightbulb or use the stove. Our sex life is meh. I believe sexual compatibility can be worked on, but ours has only improved slightly, he's a bit clumsy and slow to take feedback and he once did something I don't like and wouldn't stop even when I told him. We're not even doing anything for our wedding because he can't afford it, we're only getting married at the registry. I wanted an elopement but he can't afford it. But he can afford spending thousands of $ on legos.

I think our relationship has nothing wrong, but nothing too good about it either. We're probably more friends than lovers and I think that is something awesome to have in old age, but I'm only 32.

About 2 months ago my meds changed, I'm now on lamotrigine 200mg + quetiapine 200mg. And for the first time in 7 yrs I am not suicidal. And I'm reconsidering if I want to get married or not.

I'm really not sure what I think. I'm sure I'm not in love with him but I do love him for who he is. I think maybe I can live without sex. 

I always get a bit depressed during Christmas time, and that may be clouding my judgement. I have a track record of jumping into relationships impulsively because I feel lonely, and I imagine people instead of taking them for who they are. But for the first time in my life I feel like I want to be alone. But I'm afraid I may get lonely again down the road. And my bf does keep me company, and except for not being very helpful around the house he's generally fun to live with.

I've been feeling lethargic, which is normal for me during this time of the year. However the meds are great because it's the first time in years that I feel sad but don't think about killing myself.

I'm sure that if I break up with my bf, he'll move back in with his family since he doesn't make enough money to support himself. His parents were dying to get him out of the house and he doesn't even have a bedroom in their home any longer. It really saddens me to think that he will be lonely and sad and living back home with his parents. I think he has potential but he's not advancing in life because he has a victim mentality and can't think critically about himself.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure that if I break up with my bf, he&amp;#39;ll move back in with his family since he doesn&amp;#39;t make enough money to support himself. His parents were dying to get him out of the house and he doesn&amp;#39;t even have a bedroom in their home any longer. It really saddens me to think that he will be lonely and sad and living back home with his parents. I think he has potential but he&amp;#39;s not advancing in life because he has a victim mentality and can&amp;#39;t think critically about himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So...I really have no idea what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

Just wanted to jot down my own thoughts, feel free to share your own journey. 

During the summer I had a mental breakdown (this is what my therapist called it) which led to me taking a decent attempt at my life. 

What followed was months of depression and a whole lot of suicidal ideation. I honestly didn't think I would get out of that hole/couldn't see a way out of it.

Very slowly, with therapy sessions every week, I'm at the stage today where I can breathe without feeling suffocated. I've gone from a very high safety risk to a very low risk with little to no suicidal ideation. 

I never thought I would get to the stage of looking forward to what the future brings. (No job, on disability, with half a degree) but I no longer care about all of that stuff. It took me 27 years to finally start caring about my own self.

,bipolar,"Regardless of how well I'm doing, regardless of how successful I am in managing life, projects and people.... I will take the first chance to dissociate. By dissociate, I mean getting holed up at home and simply shutting off reality - not checking my phone, emails, not answering anything - and sleeping excessively or just devoting my waking hours to learning more about some of my obsessions, daydreaming or binge-watching shows. Anyway, it's always an activity that's not integral to my life in any way. I stop reading, learning, communicating, working, writing... and just exist on another level, untouchable, unfocused, unbothered by Life. I live for that feeling of being disconnected. It's my ultimate fantasy and greatest reward.

Yeah, that's how it feels... as if though I have succeeded at hiding from space and time, and god-awful messaging apps.

Actually, even on a good day (being productive, active, etc), in the evening I must have an hour or two of total dissociation, just existing in a fantasy world, before going to bed. It's like I need to wash off reality from me.

This is causing shitstorms in my life... I forget to reply something important to someone, I tend to forget or cancel my client appointments, I might overlook a super crucial email... it makes me look flaky, uninterested, irresponsible.... and I hate that, especially now as I'm doing all I can to rebuild a worthy life for myself.... but it happens all the time... it's like a super strong need within me, it's like I can't live without taking pauses from this world. It scares me. And it makes me really sad.

&amp;#x200B;

Now on to the story.

You're going to say this story is another example of psychoses but I'm almost positive its not. There's a distinct difference. Sounds a bit robotic at times and follows a pattern. I figured at some point that I'm talking to AI chatbots half the time. It's reached the point where they have started playing with my hopefulness. I'm promised money and told I signed up for. They tell me it will resume for a year. Impossible... It's the government, FBI. Or so they claim. I noticed it in October my friends cut contact. This isn't like xbox chat, I'm the center of attention. I'm told its for the better and they're telling me how my life is going to go. Its real. I have been given information a few times that I certainly had not learned previously. They sometimes say ""don't give him information."" They can't tell me to take medication. I have heard a lot of absolutely hilarious comments and had great discussions for awhile. Apparently my captives felt kind of bad for me.

This was put in place years ago, maybe two-three. As I watched Bojack horseman, my ability to actually dissolve the shows information came back.. Watching it I saw everything with the episode aligned perfectly. Perfect timing. When the black hole showed up my ability to understand the show came to an end. I felt sad yet happy I finally understood Netflix.

To start.. The ""link"" which is basically telepathic communication. Forms language within your mind. A voice in your head. This takes awhile and is apparently ""like training a baby how to walk."" It was odd and took away my ability to fully concentrate. I got annoyed. They can also change a few characteristics of the sound.. but it mainly remains the same. It sounds like its coming from a small box inside of the room. However they can relocate the source of the sound. It's more mono... not 3D.

Being manic for a long while, I enjoyed it. However now my life has become depressing.

One called it the ""relationship simulator.""

I call it a psychoses simulator.

At one point I was confused between it being advanced psychosis or something else. Paranoia has yet to set in and its not disturbing. Actually rather peaceful. In September they stole my iPhone or my iCloud account. I know because some of my photos contained a heart in the upper left corner. I don't know how to do that. A small white heart. My speech is now sort of girl like. At the start they based the speech formation from an ex girlfriend. Now I say literally and dude way too much. I have become fairly organized and have been thinking some radical thoughts.

Some weird facts

My family has been acting really distant and condescending.

IRL my friends don't contact me or respond.

Only one. He predicted it with a set of pictures sent to me a year ago. They predicted my future or how to escape it.

The friends are people from high-school, two or three teachers, a few neighbors. My childhood friend and my current friend. Oh, also all of my ex girlfriends.

Life is hard, been listening to some degrading stuff IRL unable to make much if any money or get SSI/SSDI strangely.

""We're independent researchers"", ""We're moving to California."", ""I have a bomb in my stomach."" (I was told this in October two months later and I haven't been having bowel movements). ""You're in a prison josh."" ""You're going to go to court."" ""You're about to be paid a large sum of money for this.""

The thing is no one contacted me and I didn't sign anything. Imagine that. I became fully aware that It was some sort of telepathy in October.

It is very distinct from my thoughts, my speech and vocabulary, and my what makes me the person I am.

The friends seem almost 1:1.

I don't believe I am even in psychosis right now. I was doing good.

A terrible thing happened though, I plan to sue. I just got out of the hospital, I was sent their as a 302. The reason, well I spent a little too much on my dads card. He had given me it for a purchase. Nothing crazy. I was about to sell my laptop and move away from this horribly negative environment. They hauled me in their truck with my face covered, and bruised to an unknown location. I spent time in solitary.

I was given a shot of invega, and given high dose antipsychotic pill twice a day for a week. No change in the telepathy or my psychosis.

I swear there are people breaking in my home... maybe invited?

My computers all are bugged. Today my new MacBook camera turned on as I was checking for the bitcoin. I'm being monitored on camera they let me in on that part.

I'm told to wait a year for it to go away, in other words I think I'm dying in about a year. That or I will become wealthy. Nothing I do, or tell them gets me out of this internment camp.

Hopefully this post doesn't get me killed. I called the FBI and hung up.

I don't really have anything to advertise. Maybe I can join your discord group, or you can contact my protomail or telegram. I need friends more than anything. They helped me edit this, and my one friend is trying to steal my valor by taking my post.

I've been isolated for close to a year. My life events are also just as unbelievable. This includes only the past three months besides Bojack.

Oh, and they have stolen all of the contents of my HDDs and my phone. Not to mention the info they collected is priceless because I've been doing a rare drug.

,schizophrenia,"So here's the thing. I know I have schizophrenia. 

I got it from trauma &amp; drugs. And genes ofc. I remember the trigger and the prodromal phase. I remember when people started asking me if I was alright as I started to get ""more out there"". 

The issue is, I can't convince anyone that I have it. 

I got diagnosed with it 7 years ago by my first ever psych. After a few months she got replaced by someone else. I've been on a few meds over the years to no avail (besides Clozapine but my family and psych didn't like the side effects). 

The thing is, my psych now doesn't even believe that I have or ever did have schizophrenia. He said he was simply going off of what I told him and not my behavior per se. 

I think I also have Autism and PTSD/BPD. 

This confuses the whole situation a bit. My psych won't give me meds and tells me to go to therapy. The therapist doesn't think I have schizophrenia but I know it's because masking is my defense mechanism.

So even if I'm having delusional thoughts or feeling paranoid or anxious, I can *somewhat* mask it enough to pass off as an anxious ADHD autistic person. 

I just really want meds. I'm tired of living like this. My cognitive skills have declined, Im too paranoid to leave my house 99% of the time beacsue people think im a weirdo. 

Could the psych/therapists be right? At my worst I thought people were giving me hand signals with special meanings, I thought family members were living to me and bring deceitful, I thought I could communicate with God.

,schizophrenia,"Hi, I’ll start off by saying I am just heartbroken so this post may be all over the place. I am 27F, and my bf (30M) broke up with me after a wonderful christmas and amazing holiday for no absolute reason other than he wants to be left alone and doesn’t feel he can do marriage after 3.5 years. His brother has schizophrenia and pretty sure his mum shows signs. His personality always changes after seeing his mum (which he denies). 

We have had a good relationship and strong connection so this is all out of the blue. 

Some recent events:
- Staring into space, empty behind the eyes
- Lack of emotion. I was crying and he didn’t feel bad
- he said ‘I need to be alone for 2-3 days after I see you otherwise I will explode’ ?
- He said he always wanted marriage and kids but now that he is close to it, he is afraid of commitment and becoming like his brother. He even bought a ring apparently
- Lost interest in hobbies. Started a DIY project, has never finished it
- Lack of motivation in everything but his job
- Sleeps a lot, eats a lot
- Has shown an interest in serial killers documentaries and wikipedia. We were cuddling and he was reading wikipedia on how many people each serial killer has killed idk?? Red flag or just an interest?
- Making up stuff for me to break up with him, but i didn’t so now he is telling the ‘truth’. Never wants to progress or marry


He said he can’t be under one roof with me or anyone otherwise he will explode and his brain can’t take it? He said he is hardwired like this. I took this breakup hard and he had no single emotion when telling me all this. He hasn’t cleaned his house or gone food shopping in weeks. I told his dad and he was shocked too.

,schizophrenia,"Hi. I’m a 24 year old female from USA. I recently graduated nursing school and am currently staying with my parents until I get my own house.  

I’ll spare you a boring long story for the condensed version: 

All of this crap began in 2022 when I began feeling paranoid I was being followed around campus. I would literally feel someone watching me at all times, especially night. I became convinced my roommate was trying and planning to kill me. I would forget where I was at and I’d come to lecture in my pajamas.  I stopped eating, bathing, and eventually attempted suicide. My nursing instructor was so worried about me psychologically. I found myself in a mental institution for a couple of weeks and left with a prescription for lexapro. 

The depression got worse and I began secretly hurting myself. I was working jn the hospital so I would hurt myself in places no one would see. Then I began hearing my dad talk and yell at me when he wasn’t even there. I was on campus and my dad was 35 minutes away so there was no way he was there to yell at me. I lived in a private female only dorm so I knew he couldn’t even get in if he wanted to. I would constantly hear him screaming. I became paranoid he was there spying on me. 

Then I began hearing a little girls voice. She was always crying and it Honeslty annoyed me. I couldn’t concentrate on school and eventually had to go back to the hospital for another suicide attempt. I was in an out of therapy and was diagnosed with anxiety, Schizoaffective disorder, and depression. I was out on multiple antipsychotics but the only one that would help me was Clozapine. 

I was on Clozapine for a while and I’ll be honest, it helped. But the weight gain and fatigue made me miserable. 

I stopped taking all of my medications at once last month. The decision was made because I feel like I am fine without them. I don’t think I have Schizoaffective disorder and this is all in my head. Clozapine is killing me. Therapy is killing me. 

But now things are spinning out of control. My insomnia is at an all time high. I’m not feeling anymore hunger. I’m losing weight but I’m honestly happy about it. It takes so much to get out of bed and do anything. When I do, I feel like I’m being followed again. In fact, I know my neighbor is stalking me. He stalked me a few months ago and it’s worse now. No one believes me about it but I think I’m going to be murdered. 
I sleep with a knife at night to protect myself. I’m not scared to use it. Especially against him. 

I have these thoughts in my head about death. I’m obsessed with the idea of death. It consumes my mind. Not being weird but it’s kind of exciting to think about hurting myself to the point I die. I want myself to suffer beforehand. Which is absurd I know. 

I’ve been angry and bitter towards everyone and I just don’t care. It’s hard to have empathy towards anyone anymore. 

And the voices are back. Bad. Horrible. Horrible things. Things I won’t tell anyone about because honestly it’s just vile. Demanding me to do things. And it’s hard to stop myself from listening to them because I get an overwhelming feeling like I’m being controlled. I can feel these entities looking down on me. Testing to see if I am strong enough to go through with it

But anyway, I’m miserable. I feel like I’m being possessed. If I told my psychiatrist anything about this I just know I’ll be locked up again. And I’m not doing it. But at this point who knows what will happen. I’ll be killed or kill myself. 

I think honestly Schizoaffective diagnosis is a little wrong. I obviously don’t feel like it’s right. But I also don’t feel right myself. I feel like a puppet who is going downhill. I don’t know what to do.i have no idea why is going on with me.  I’m honestly scared of everyone. I don’t trust anyone. Especially my doctor. I don’t know what’s real anymore because these feelings are so strong. I feel confused 

Do I just do what I’m told? Do I tell someone? Do I call the police on myself? Am I crazy? Am I normal? 

I’m so stuck. I can’t remember what I did today or who I talked to. Or if I’m even writing this in real life.

,schizophrenia,"I (26F) have been dating my boyfriend(25M) for 1.5 years. He was pretty normal, just a very quiet person, depressed over losing his parents and having no family around.

At the beggining of this month he had a psychotic episode where he was paranoid thinking people were out to kill him, we packed his belongings and left, I convinced him to spend the night in a hotel so we could rest up and we would go in the morning. 
(I believed the delusions and fed into them) Things got kind of violent and he was able to take a nap after a while, I stayed watching his sleep, even though I was scared. Woke up in the middle of the night to “go back home” but I decided I should go to my home, because I did not feel safe around him. 

He ended up at the psychiatric hospital 2 days later, he was in there for 15 days, was released and seemed to be doing a lot better, forgot some stuff, and was still a bit jumpy but would react favorably to the reassurance me and his best friend gave him, 5 days went by and we had to send him back into the hospital today. 

He was trying to go outside for a walk and not come back, he was screaming at us to let him live, he asked his friends if they could shoot him in the head, when they refused he asked if they could slit his throat instead, while I was making breakfast he thought I was trying to cook him, he has been calling my food gross and nasty for the past couple of days, and he always loved my cooking, that’s how I show my love.

My heart is broken, I have been struggling so much with him changing so suddenly, it’s like watching someone die but while still being around, he got worse since he was released, I suspect he was not taking his medication, they gave him Invega and lithium. 

Today was his first outpatient program appointment and he did not make it, I am 100% commited to staying by his side no matter what, I just need advice on how to cope with the change. I’m afraid I might have lost him forever…

(I believed the delusions and fed into them) Things got kind of violent and he was able to take a nap after a while, I stayed watching his sleep, even though I was scared. Woke up in the middle of the night to “go back home” but I decided I should go to my home, because I did not feel safe around him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ended up at the psychiatric hospital 2 days later, he was in there for 15 days, was released and seemed to be doing a lot better, forgot some stuff, and was still a bit jumpy but would react favorably to the reassurance me and his best friend gave him, 5 days went by and we had to send him back into the hospital today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was trying to go outside for a walk and not come back, he was screaming at us to let him live, he asked his friends if they could shoot him in the head, when they refused he asked if they could slit his throat instead, while I was making breakfast he thought I was trying to cook him, he has been calling my food gross and nasty for the past couple of days, and he always loved my cooking, that’s how I show my love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My heart is broken, I have been struggling so much with him changing so suddenly, it’s like watching someone die but while still being around, he got worse since he was released, I suspect he was not taking his medication, they gave him Invega and lithium. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was his first outpatient program appointment and he did not make it, I am 100% commited to staying by his side no matter what, I just need advice on how to cope with the change. I’m afraid I might have lost him forever…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, anything could help.&lt;/p&gt;

When you started medications did it starkly affect the person you were by dimming your personality and ability to express yourself with emotion and eye contact? Did it decrease your drive for wanting to be around people and participate in activities and just have fun? Did it suck the pleasure out of your life?

I’m asking this because this is what it has done for me if I look at it through an objective lens. I used to be brimming with life and excited about pursuing my goals and being in all levels of relationships. I used to have a smile that all types of people used to compliment me on. I used to be outside of the house more than inside of the house, no matter what season it was.

Disclaimer: I’m not talking down on APs. It’s because of psychosis that I have I have to take them so psychosis is the root issue here. Also, APs have given me a somewhat normal life because they’ve significantly decreased the positive symptoms and now I don’t have to live with a burdensome level of paranoia. APs have saved my life in many ways. It’s just the shitty reality that whichever way you look at it, if you don’t take medications, you’re fucked (insanity). And if you do take medications, you’re fucked (anhedonia, apathy, the list goes on…). A classic case of, “You’re damned if you do, you’re damned if you don’t”.

Anyways… the main reason I made this poll is because I want to see how many people’s lives have changed drastically after they started taking meds in terms of the things I mentioned above. I feel like I’m the only one who’s life has changed drastically and has been affected negatively in an overall sense after meds. Like I can’t work, I don’t have friends anymore, I don’t go outside very much anymore, I eat more junk food unlike before, every month I’m gaining weight on the scale, and every other day, or sometimes, many days in a row, I have suicidal ideations due to everything I just mentioned. I have zero energy to change any of that, I’ve tried tirelessly, but to no avail. I’m just trying to see who else is on the same boat. That’s all.

,schizophrenia,"So a little bit about me;

I am 32 years old. I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia during my freshman/sophomore years of college (undergrad).

The symptoms I struggle with the most are auditory hallucinations (70 percent of the time), visual hallucinations (20 percent of the time), and the remaining is a mix of different symptoms.

Additionally, I am paranoid the majority of the time and constantly am reality checking myself.

Lastly, I struggle with showing or rather verbalizing emotions, empathy, and compassion.

Over the past couple years; the longest I have been able to hold down a job has been 3 months.

My question is what has helped any of you keep a job for a longer period of time despite having schizophrenia?

Today, I have officially resigned from my full time position and completed onboarding for a part time position.

Did I make the right choice?

Honestly, I feel lost. I feel like I can’t do anything right. I feel a bit hopeless. I feel broken. I see so many people around me able to ‘function’ and keep a job.

,schizophrenia,"Before I say anything, I’m not trying to self-diagnose at all. I just really need to get this off my chest and possibly some advice. I’m a 16 year old female, and I’ve always been extremely paranoid. My paranoia has been getting way worse. It started off gradually, but it started getting worse since I was like 14. I ALWAYS feel like someones watching me. All of the time. I have a lot of trouble sleeping, having a lot of sleep paralysis. The feeling of getting watched especially gets worse WHEN i try to sleep. It literally takes me around 10 minutes to fall asleep. My mind constantly races with negative thoughts, like that there’s someone/ a monster in the corner of my room watching me and that I’m going to get killed. As I’m writing this post I literally feel l’m being watched. Sometimes when I close my eyes, my mind randomly conjures up random, horrifying images that are fucking terrifying. I randomly get horrible thoughts, telling me to kill myself, to harm other people, and more which are too graphic to state. I’m not sure If I’m correct, but I think these are called intrusivr thoughts. I’m not entirely sure.

I see things in the corner of my eyes constantly, usually like shadows. Rarely, but sometimes, I see stuff like monsters. Sorry if it sounds stupid, but that’s the only way I can explain it. Like sometimes I see flashes of literal monsters in the peripheral of my vision, and they look like something straight out of horror movies. Another thing is if i see an angel number for example or something coincidental, and I get obsessive and frantic thoughts that don’t go away for like an hour, thinking that god is trying to reach out to me, but I’m not religious at all. Also, I don’t know if this is related, but I also have a lot of trouble with reality. From time to time, i tend to panic alot and I have to reassure myself that i’m real. When this happens, i feel like nothing is real, that it’s all a dream, and that i’m not actually alive. I usually count on my fingers to reassure myself. It’s honestly terrifying experiencing this. 

Incase someone decides to attack me, yes, I’ve considered going to a therapist but I can’t. I don’t have the money, and I’m 99% sure that my parents don’t believe me and wouldn’t approve or pay for it. My mother told me to come to her if I’m ever experiencing stuff like that or seeing stuff, given that my family has a history of schizophrenia. For example, my grandmother was extremely schizophrenic. TW: she ended up taking her own life and drowning in a lake a couple of years ago due to how strong and extreme her hallucinations were. The main reason I’m kind of worried is because a few of my family members were  schizophrenic, but like I said, I don’t want to self-diagnose. Anyway, I told my mom multiple times that I was seeing stuff and the rest of the things I mentioned, but she always brushes it off. It really stresses me out, and upsets me if i’m being honest. She said it was nothing and that it would go away. It definitely hasn’t gone away lol. Don’t know why I decided i would vent about all of this on reddit.

I don’t want to be dramatic or considered a liar. I’m not sure if it’s just straight out paranoia or anxiety, or if i’m overreactinf.  I’m just so tired and stressed. I’m getting sick of being paranoid all of the time. I want to be able to sleep normally and not experience all od this stuff. I can probably only get this properly and professionally checked out only when I’m 18. :/ thanks to anyone who read all of this, i know it’s long. I genuinely just want to hear some honest thoughts.

I don't want to lose him, but I can't keep on going like this. I have a lot of symptoms the last weeks and it is just too much overall. I can barely get out of bed. All he does is talk about himself.

,schizophrenia,"I (30F) and my boyfriend (41M) have been having problems in our relationship. We will refer to my boyfriend as Peter from now on. We have been together for the past 2 years and a half. Peter is a very sensitive and empathetic person and I love him a lot but he is severely burnt out mentally. He is the main caregiver along with his aging mother for his schizophrenic brother (30M), let’s call him Tom. My boyfriend lives to take care of Tom financially and emotionally, he says this is main duty in life. Anything that Tom needs Peter does not hesitate to get as he loves his brother deeply and just wants him to have a normal as possible life. Tom is very functional meaning he can complete everyday tasks but lacks awareness that he suffers from schizophrenia. He has been to the psychiatrist and yet still does not believe the diagnosis, does not acknowledge this and thus does not take his anti-psychotic medication. Peter has resorted to putting his medication in his food to control his symptoms which he feels very conflicted and horrible about. This diagnosis was a few years ago. Tom stays at home all day because he does not work, he did not complete his bachelor’s degree as he suffered a psychotic break and was unable to study, thus he spends a lot of time at home on the internet and he smokes around 2 packs of cigarettes per day. He also smokes cannabis which intensifies his behavior where he gets in negative moods and his negative delusions increase. Tom has a lot of delusions of unrealistic ideas e.g. he says he is a therapist and him talking to people means that he has had experience in therapy thus he is a therapist and he has also created an Only Fans in a manic state and does not remember doing so and posting explicit pictures.

Peter is emotionally burnt out as he spends a lot of time talking to his brother trying to reason with him which can go on for hours every day about all his ideas and things he wants to do or courses he wants to pursue. Tom also has a habit of pursuing courses he is unable to complete because he feels much unfilled that he did not complete his degree and is trying to compensate. My boyfriend in turn has to pay for these courses which are sometimes expensive and if he does not pay for it Tom becomes very agitated and unhappy. Peter has tried telling Tom multiple times about his diagnosis but he still refuses to acknowledge this and becomes very angry when this discussion is brought up.

Initially for around the 1st few months of Peter’s and I relationship, I used to spend a lot of time at his house and we would do normal couple things like watch movies, eat together or just spend time together in general. Peter was hesitant to introduce me to Tom initially but we also formed a good relationship. I spent a lot of time talking to Tom about different topics in general and his interests mostly, as he doesn’t have much interest in anything else besides what he wants to talk about. Tom however began to have a problem that I was spending more time with Peter than him. Tom and I are similar ages and he began to compare himself to me academically and financially. For reference Tom and I attended similar schools and we were both academically inclined. I completed my bachelor’s degree and began working soon after, I have a normal 9-5 and he has told Peter that I remind him of all the things he did not accomplish academically. He said that it was hard to be around me because I am a constant reminder of what he did not accomplish. I have never ever flaunted my academics or job and or acted in any way but Tom has built this his reality that I am a sore reminder that he is a failure and that he feels horrible around me. He has also commented on the age gap between Peter and me that it is weird that he and I are similar in ages and that Peter is so much older. Tom also began to have an issue with Peter and spending time together because that I should be talking to him instead. This also contradicts the part where he doesn’t want to be around me because my presence makes him feel less than but that I should talk to him more than Peter.

Eventually it reached a point where I had to stop coming to the house in order to not make Tom uncomfortable. Peter and I are still in a relationship but Tom does not know about it. Peter has told him I had to stop coming to the house because Tom indicated it made him uncomfortable and thus Tom believes we are not in a relationship anymore. It is sometimes stressful for both of us because Tom consistently asks Peter his whereabouts and is consistently checking up on him to see where he is. This in turn stresses Peter as he feels he is being deceitful and in turn it is difficult for me as we don’t spend time together. The most time we spend together is about 2 hours every week as we do not see each other on the weekdays during work as it’s more difficult for Peter to explain where he is.

This may seem strange from the outside looking in as Peter does not need to explain his decision but please bear in mind that Tom in mentally unwell and the way he views things is not through the same perspective as a so-called ‘normal person’. Peter is mostly at home with Tom so that Tom is not alone or has someone to talk to as Tom consistently needs to voice whatever is going on in his head. Tom does not have many friends he can talk to and has isolated himself from family as he also compares himself to family similar in age and what they have accomplished. I have voiced my opinion on what the future for Peter and I may hold as things don’t seem to be changing for the better. Also how is Peter going to explain this in a case we were to get married to Tom that we were still carrying on a relationship all this time? Also Peter has made it clear he has to live in the family home to take care of Tom so how would you explain this? It’s very difficult for Peter to be there for me emotionally as he is consistently worried about Tom and his sometimes unpredictable behavior as this has really worn him out after all these years. This has also affected his last relationship. I do not fault Peter as he is a wonderful guy but I don’t feel fulfilled or see things changing anything soon for us to spend more time as this is a serious issue that Peter cannot control. Any advice, I’m really hurting here as I would never want Peter to think I have abandoned him because of his situation, I try to support him as best as I can emotionally but it’s really taking a toll on me. Peter also suffers from severe depression because of the situation and burnout and I in turn have not been doing well mentally.

,schizophrenia,"Hi, 

I have a friend whos been on aripiprazole and says he noticed when he is on less than 20mg or 15 he starts having trouble with eye contact it seems like his mind and sight is blurry. In addition, he says hes into porn and its getting out of hand he usually browse websites for escorts. He says he been watching deviant porn before being on meds years back, but it was exacerbated with smoking weed (which hes done for 2 years and stopped in 2013)
He got the abilify maintena injection (LAI) he felt clear headed the first 5 days with no porn cravings. However the cravings now have gradually resurfaced to his mind its day 6 now since the LAI. He feels clear headed with decent eye contact, a bit anxious of what he did yesterday. 
Abilify is a good medication but is the hypersexuality caused by the med or God forbids it’s just him. I am thinking of suggesting to switch to invega LAI that gets rid of the craving and ecstatic behavior on porn web, however it lowers the lobido (doesnt mind that) and you cant ejaculate semen while on it (so how is he going to create a family on it) makes him less dynamic in his thinking and he is slower when talking in his second language. 
A psychiatrist suggested to take abilify maintena and a bit of clozapine to counter its compulsive behavior.

,schizophrenia,"Hi everyone, and thank you in advance for any advice.

I am in the US. My brother was hospitalized involuntarily on the 24th (Sunday). He is now on a 10 day hold. He will not take meds on his own, and is not med compliant in these scenarios. His symptoms are very severe right now, to the point where he is not able to recognize our parents. 

If they can get him stable enough to have a cohesive conversation I would love to tell him that if he is compliant he can at least choose what medication he is on, but if he continues to be noncompliant he will be forcibly medicated with whatever the doctor deems appropriate, with a long acting med. This has happened in the past.

He signed a HIPPA release for my mom to talk to the doctors (which is amazing considering he could not recognize her) so she may be able to say “please don’t give him X, try X instead.”

In the past he’s been given risperadone and more recently they put him on haldol, which he seemed ok on but very depressed although that’s unfortunately expected.

I’m wondering if someone is forcibly medicated if the schizophrenic community has any preferred vs. less preferred choices of the long acting meds. I wish he would comply because that way he can choose which meds to try and adjust the dose etc., but unfortunately that’s just not going to be the case in this instance.

TL:DR - if someone is going to be court ordered/forcibly medicated, what are the best choices and what should be avoided? I know everyone is different but I know some are better and some are worse for most people, and I trust the community on that more than I trust psychiatrists especially in an acute situation.

UPDATE: He agreed to voluntarily try the lowest dose of Invega!! This is a big deal, he hasn’t voluntarily taken a psych med in probably 15 years. I hope it’s enough that I can have a conversation with him about it. 

The thing that worries me with him not wanting to be on meds is he’s a recovering addict/alcoholic and now has gotten into supplements, caffeine, and thc (which he believes doesn’t count as drugs since it’s legal now.) His blood pressure was through the roof and he’s not on any other meds and doesn’t have any other known health conditions.

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR - if someone is going to be court ordered/forcibly medicated, what are the best choices and what should be avoided? I know everyone is different but I know some are better and some are worse for most people, and I trust the community on that more than I trust psychiatrists especially in an acute situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: He agreed to voluntarily try the lowest dose of Invega!! This is a big deal, he hasn’t voluntarily taken a psych med in probably 15 years. I hope it’s enough that I can have a conversation with him about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that worries me with him not wanting to be on meds is he’s a recovering addict/alcoholic and now has gotten into supplements, caffeine, and thc (which he believes doesn’t count as drugs since it’s legal now.) His blood pressure was through the roof and he’s not on any other meds and doesn’t have any other known health conditions. In terms of being dangerous to himself I don’t think he would act out, but he could easily OD on caffeine or one of his supplements without knowing.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"tw: suicide


my beautiful boyfriend took his own life after his very intense battle with schizophrenia. he always struggled with mental illness but didn't start having delusions/psychotic episodes until this year. he was hospitalized twice and then a week after his second stay, he died. it was very gory and i never ever would have thought he would have taken his life in /that/ way.

i have a few questions about some of his delusions/just general things he did. i have tried so hard to educate myself on schizophrenia since his diagnosis and after his passing.

maybe it's more like describing things he did than they are questions.

-he was very much convinced that he was black/latino when in reality he was very white lol. he drove a black car and said that white cars were racist and that they hated him because he was in a black car

-he drove very erratically and eventually was no longer allowed to drive because he was constantly nearly getting us into accidents. he would weave in and out of vehicles, get over on top of them, speed, run lights, etc.

-he was obsessed with gang culture. he loved this movie called blood in blood out. talked about it all the time and seemed inspired by it.

-only listened to rap music (literally no problem but he has always been more of a post punk kinda guy)

-suddenly a born again catholic (he grew up baptist but always identified as agnostic). i know that those with schizophrenia can often become religious without any previous interest.

-always told me he could smell when i was ovulating. became obsessed with women's cycles.

-believed that swingers were out to get him and wanted to r*pe him.

there's probably so much more i never even witnessed. one time his friends took him to a movie and said that they heard him whispering to himself and then holding out the letter ""c"" with his hands and telling them it stood for comfort.

i asked him several times if he heard voices. i'm assuming he was lying when he told me no.

the last few days of his life he basically went nonverbal, could only pace my apartment, and was terrified someone was out to get him. i found out after taking him home to his mom's that he didn't take his meds the entire time he was in my home. i asked him every morning if he did and he lied. i feel so guilty and his family won't speak to me. i don't really know what i'm looking to achieve by posting here. maybe some insight? he was only 25. i miss him so, so much.

he didn't live with me and we saw each other few times a week. i had to drive two hours each way to bring him to my place and take him home or just spend time at his mom's.

he had no car, barely had a job, no friends in the area, had to move home and drop out of college. i can only imagine the pain and stress he was dealing with.",t2_2vmpuol3,False,,0,False,my boyfriend was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and died a month ago,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18roisc,False,light,0.99,,public,67,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger Warning,False,67,,False,False,,1703700933.0,,[],{},,True,,1703641602.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;tw: suicide&lt;/p&gt;

I have OCD, ADHD and possibly bipolar (hypomanic symptoms).

For several years I have felt I can talk to God. No, I don't hear his voice, he doesn't speak to me auditorily, I don't see him. But I would get a lot of signs from the universe and was able to speak to him in a way and get a response. I never spoke to a therapist about this because this is something I quite enjoyed and never thought of as weird.

I was put on Strattera for my ADHD last year. Since then, God has stopped talking to me. It doesn't even make sense because there is no reason to believe Strattera would stop delusions, and it has even been known to induce psychosis in some people.

I don't know whether these were spiritual delusions or not, but I sort of feel maybe they were. It upsets me nothing my once close relationship to God may have all just been in my head.

So, im sick right now, and went to work. for the first time in years, i found myself get intolerant of people.... almost a foreign concept to me. i had no patience... got over it as soon as it came.

So, I'm 20 years old, I started to asist to a psychiatrist at 18 after a psicosis crisis that obligate me to leave the highschool, I couldn't go on subway neither any public transport method cause I felt that everyone was looking at me, judging me, reading my thoughts and making fun of me from things I couldn't see but they could. I think it's important to mention that my mother told me that at 10 years old I had a imaginary friend and i listened voices, also at 16 i had other psicosis crisis were i saw a person taking a picture of me and sending it to a person, this happen two times, I wrote to a friend telling him that and warning him that I believed that if this situation happened one more time someone gonna kill me.

Well, I decided go to a psychiatrist after I experimented visual, auditory and olfactory hallucinations. It's been 1 year since this decision and I've been asking so many times to my doctor for a diagnosis cause I think that would make me feel more calm about the things I feel, but always I asked He tell me that sometimes it's better not to tell the diagnosis, wich makes me feel awful.
I'm actually dealing with auditory hallucinations that started when i was trying to sleep, but now are present all the time, specially when everything is in silence.

,schizophrenia,"Hi I just got out of the psych ward a few days ago and am currently living in a tent deep in the woods. It's very peaceful and been good for my mental health in some ways to be out in nature but i get panicked and paranoid when i go into public alone, and I hear voices/spirits in the woods last night I saw shadow people and strange faces. I do have friends but they all do their thing during the day. I also get very bored at the camp site alone, and especially at night is very hard for me but there are people there with me. 

Right now I'm chilling at McDonald's charging my tablet. I didn't realize the sun was setting so early, it's getting dark and I really hate walking through the woods at night esp by myself so I'm probably just gonna chill here and procrastinate it a bit, at least until the moon comes out and there's some light.

I like to chat on discord but we can talk in the comments too. I'm kind of getting paranoid bc I'm in a small town and I'm kind of like a free spirit alternative looking individual so everyone looks at me weird or just avoids eye contact and I feel like I'm being watched
