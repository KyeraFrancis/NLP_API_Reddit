,Army,"'Twas the night before Christmas
And high in the sky
A single, lone plane
Through the air did fly

On board a Paratrooper
And pallets of toys
Ready for heavy drop
To good girls and boys

Now Santa stands ready
Only ten minutes more
The jumpmaster says
""Stand in the door!""

Santa Claus jumps out
As the red light turns green
His parachute rigged toys
From the ground can be seen

The toys fall in chimneys
All across the land
Bringing joy and smiles
And a Christmas so grand

The Christmas drop was successful
And Santa PLFs with precision
Because Santa is a Paratrooper
With the 82nd Airborne Division

Happy Holidays!

,Army,"BLUF: It’s Christmas and I need a void to vent into. I’m not in any danger and I think my life is gonna get better but this year was rough.

It’s Christmas, my buddies are downrange on a deployment I was promised I’d be on, spent an inordinate amount of money and time getting ready for and didn’t get to go. They’re over there and I’m here and I can’t enjoy anything, I just feel left behind, left out, and downright angry.

I’m literally just sitting around waiting for the bar to open in an hour so I can walk down there and hopefully have one fun memory today.

I wish I was down there with my friends, not here hoping my active duty transfer magically one day goes through or for a deployment to come along.

&gt;After  years of headlines and watchdog reports condemning shoddy living  conditions for service members and families, a consensus appears to be  developing between Army senior leaders, housing executives and even  lawmakers that something drastic must occur to fix the service’s  barracks and family housing for good.  
&gt;  
&gt;Army  Secretary Christine Wormuth has repeatedly called for a “generational  investment” in the service’s housing and barracks stock that goes beyond  the constraints of the regular budgeting process, in which every  investment comes at the cost of another priority.

Ah yes, throw more studies at the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But some critics are concerned that the service might struggle to take  care of its new and repaired buildings even if such an investment were  to occur. The Army systematically underfunded barracks maintenance  during much of the War on Terror era in order to fund other priorities. 

The problem is that the Army (DOD as a whole really) loves to play the ""we can't fix the barracks or family housing because we spent those funds and we can't raid another pot of money"" and then the service either delays or DOES raid the money for the barracks because ""readiness"". 

If the Army is serious about fixing the issue, the money needs to be locked down.  I don't care if some BDE needs to deploy but couldn't manager their funds or if there are weeds on the small arms ranges.  The money to fix the barracks and family housing should ONLY be spent on housing. 

Fixing housing won't solve all the QOL issues but it will fix one of the biggest ones.

The Army systematically underfunded barracks maintenance  during much of the War on Terror era in order to fund other priorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the Army (DOD as a whole really) loves to play the &amp;quot;we can&amp;#39;t fix the barracks or family housing because we spent those funds and we can&amp;#39;t raid another pot of money&amp;quot; and then the service either delays or DOES raid the money for the barracks because &amp;quot;readiness&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Army is serious about fixing the issue, the money needs to be locked down.  I don&amp;#39;t care if some BDE needs to deploy but couldn&amp;#39;t manager their funds or if there are weeds on the small arms ranges.  The money to fix the barracks and family housing should ONLY be spent on housing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing housing won&amp;#39;t solve all the QOL issues but it will fix one of the biggest ones.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"So I'm in my late 20s and I'm interested in trying out for Army Special Operations (Rangers or SF). The mission of the Rangers seems more appealing to me than SF. But I hear a lot of people saying if you are enlisting in your late 20s you should do SF and not Rangers.

Does my age make that much of a difference when trying to decide between those two? Like would my age make that much of a difference in Ranger Regiment? Both obviously would be amazing opportunities and are very interesting, but Rangers overall seems more interesting to me personally due to their mission and specializations.

Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks!

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s so many fucking resources out there. Is it really worth fucking your life up or some families lives up just because you wanted to hangout and try to get some strange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just be fucking safe, everyone. I know we all hate seeing a brother or sister dying from something simple and stupid. &lt;/p&gt;

,USMC,"It’s a novel about PTSD, the persistence of memory, existentialism, and the absurdity of war; written by a guy who was in combat during the Battle of the Bulge, was captured by the Germans, and was a prisoner of war in Dresden during the infamous allied fire bombing of the city. 

It uses science fiction as a framing device and it’s super easy to read; if a bit scattered at times, in classic Vonnegut style. 

This passage really impacted me, and it’s one of many: 

&gt;It was a movie about American bombers in World War II and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this: American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.

&gt;The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers , and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.

&gt;When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas.

To explain from the beginning, I had just dropped out of the reserves after a mobilization so I could do a private security contract overseas. I was prior active, only went in the reserves to try it out and I luckily got mobilized to do OAW with the refugee crisis.

I knew my contract was about to be over within 8 months but I had intentions to re-enlist in the IRR for personal reasons. ATM it sounded more simpler, and I was able to do it while in a different country.

Long story short, due to complications, I couldn’t and just decided to move on. Until I was contacted by a prior service recruiter, asking if I wanted to re-up since I only had a month left on my contract.

He basically said he could temporarily drop me in a reserve unit and get an emergency extension and drop me out so I can re enlist in the IRR. Since retention is so bad, he said he does it all of the time.

I explained my situation entirely and how I can’t because I’m working in a different country and I won’t be able to check in the unit or make any drills for a year. He said not to worry, I wouldn’t have to make that months drill or the next because the unit was doing AIT in 29 palms and the next month was a blackout (no drill). He will do all of the work and have me in and out. 

I was skeptical but I was desperate. I did it, he said he would do all of the work. Even comforted me by saying this is all legal cause you definitely have to do this process in person.

Well after he dropped me in and 2 weeks go by with no word, I called him to check in. Basically said he was busy so he pushed me to some E-5 career planner that was fresh to the company, knew him when I was in that same company.

I called the company career planner and he had no idea about my situation so I had to explain everything. He said he’ll take care of my emergency extension and my drop out papers simultaneously so I would have to show up for drill. 

2 more weeks go by and I check in again, he basically said he pushed me to S-1 and gave me their office phone (which didn’t work). I saw what was going on and got pissed. I said fuck it and was just gonna wait until my contract was finished, I had other shit to worry about at the time.

3 months go by and I get a called from this aggressive SSGT accusing me of being UA for like 3-4 months and I explained my situation and he then start throwing more charges like falsifying paper work. Apparently if I didn’t show up immediately they would take away my earned benefits and drop my Honorable discharge. So I naturally freaked out.

I called the company 1 sgt and explained everything and he basically calmed me down, and told me he would set a meeting up with the CO/XO. 

During the meeting it was explained to me that my situation just sounded like a huge communication error and they would work with me. Basically they will just drop me out and forget everything, swept everything under the rug.

Not the type of person to blame everything on the Marine Corps but I really felt used in this situation, like just a body to fill someone’s quota. But I do admit I share complete responsibility in this as well.

On your last patrol, you intercepted an enemy recon patrol and terminated the threat. You task one of your TLs to conduct TSE and they found a supply of pharmaceutical grade methamphetamine tablets on the EKIA. You confiscated them because they might assist you and your squad later.

You’re currently conducting rehearsals with your squad after getting a Warn-O for a company night raid on a heavily fortified compound. You remember the meth tablets and consider supplying them to your troops to further increase their combat effectiveness.

Joined the marine corps at 27(now 31) when at the moment of truth I disclosed  2 “seizures” that I had 2 years prior and never went to the doctors because of lack of medical coverage. I never made it past receiving and eventually got sent home. I had what my doctor called a syncope episode in late 2022 and one in early 2023 and he said it was due to being sunburnt, dehydrated, and drinking alcohol while on vacation. l wasn’t eating healthy then because I wasn’t doing well mentally and coping with unhealthy food and a good amount of alcohol. I have now since stopped and started being healthy again and working out and have been fine. I’ve had an EEG done and results came back normal so nothing neurological. 

I was told when going to medical at parris island that the marine corps is 5 years seizure free without medication can stay or join. 

My question is will the 2 syncope episodes I had and got checked out for disqualifying? Or will I be able to get a waiver. I would like to join a branch before I turn 35 to get that itch to serve taken care of.

I am writing this because I need some perspective, insights and experiences. 

  
I have been diagnosed for roughly a year, but I have had this disorder for about 2.5-3 years. During this time I have never told my family, they know nothing about my well-being and I have liked to keep it separate. I live in another city and only see them once or twice a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the issue is that my conversation therapist has been pushing me lately to tell them. He believes that this would drop a stone off my shoulders. While he is likely correct, I can only see bad things coming out of this. My family very rarely talk about our issues and pains. Cronical illnesses are mentioned in passing by and serious pain is kept under the rug. This isn't healthy or good but it is how we do things. However, I also know that by telling my mother, the rest of my family and relatives would know within a week. I wouldn't want this. I also know that I would never get a moment of peace after telling her, everything would become about my well-being and she would never see me anymore only the disorder. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the real question is:

Is there anyone like me who didn't want to tell anyone but eventually did? What were the outcomes, do you regret it, etc. etc.

,bipolar,"hey everyone this is my second ever reddit post so bear with me please. 

21F, i was diagnosed around 1.5/2 years ago after i had my first manic episode. i have also been diagnosed with GAD, a dissociative disorder, and PTSD. i am unmedicated for all of these willingly as i was on abilify, but could not take it consistently and my parents worried about the physical effects of going off and on meds (family history of blood clots, stroke, etc.). i started using daylio to track my moods and have worked on a lot of grounding/coping mechanisms to somewhat alleviate my various symptoms.

i’ve been staying with my family who i haven’t seen in a few years (i grew up with them but moved across the US when i was 15) and while it has been lovely, they are in poor health. my time here has been very sweet and i’ve been feeling good, but i can tell when i leave in a few days i’m probably going to have a depressive episode. 

i’ve dealt with my depression fairly well through my life, and i can identify it easily before i’m truly in the throes of it. the last true depressive episode i had was entirely different because i had what i can only describe as symptoms of psychosis (hallucinations, ideation, paranoia). does anyone have any tips on how to manage those symptoms if they come up? last time this happened i was on “watch” for two weeks and couldn’t work, which i can’t do this time due to my financial situation. 

i am also wondering if anyone has any tricks to identifying manic episodes. i’ve had a few but until i was diagnosed after my first, i hadn’t experienced that before. i tend to not understand my mania until i’m at the tail end of an episode, usually after i’ve done something reckless/“bad” (spending money, getting new jobs, driving for extreme amounts of time/traveling, etc.) i’m worried this time because if i am about to have a depressive episode, my family has expressed to me that i could move with them back to my home town. im worried that i will take them up on this offer and not completely think it through (leaving my current primary support system for a cross country move) 

i think the fact that im thinking about this now is a good sign, but i tend to dissociate during my manic episodes so im not sure if ill even remember the pros and cons of moving back to be with my family.

If you don’t give a shit i completely understand, have a peaceful day. 

So, i’ve always fought to get a diagnosis because i thought that it would validate my experience and people would finally stop treating me like i’m exaggerating. Ive been to the psych clinic 2 times this year and i’ve been on meds and all that. But i hadn’t seen it on paper you know. And recently i finally did. Turns out i was diagnosed with bipolar? They just didn’t tell me. And now i feel empty and sad. I don’t want that diagnosis anymore because i feel like i can’t go back you know? It would be for life if i wasn’t diagnosed too but this feels more official. Everytime i see something about bipolar being for life, tears well in my eyes. Like yea congrats you’re stuck with this because we said so, the only thing you can do about it is take those meds that you hate and pay for expensive therapy sessions. 

I feel like an ingrate. I wanted someone to tell me that i wasn’t delusional but now that it has happened, i want the opposite. Please go back on your words and tell me it was just a phase and i won’t have to seriously consider ending it all anymore. I think i was in deep denial, in more than one way. I wanted to reassure myself that i wasn’t « worthless to society » and just a product of my trauma. But thinking about it now, i don’t actually give a shit about pleasing anyone in this depressing world. Am i fraud?
I’m conflicted because on one hand i don’t wanna be a burden to the people i genuinely care about, but on the other hand i don’t wanna be a « useful member of society » because i despise this disgusting society i live in. Besides the people i love i can’t think of a single reason i would want to hang on. I find fault in everything. I’m cynical and negative (i’m probably only saying this bc i’m depressed rn but whatever). I just can’t help myself, i don’t wanna keep the peace and no matter how hard i try to convince myself otherwise, i almost never want to put in effort. 
I know i’m not a terrible person, i have values, i try to help people as best as i can and i would never hurt anyone intentionally. So why do i feel so stupid and mean and unreasonable ??? :(

,bipolar,"I have Type 2 BP, ever since I moved into my boyfriend's family's home my depressive lows have been increasing and I've been sleeping for days and can't find a way out of it easily. There are a few days I manage to live out a whole day normally.

I was diagnosed professionally when I was a child at 7 and had therapy until I was 16.
I'm 25 now and since 17, I never medicate for it anymore and I take daily vitamins and have a focused diet to keep me more stable. 

My boyfriend's family is very laid back and understanding so there is no issue at all with them which I am thankful for. 

My boyfriend and I spend every second together and he seems to never handle my bipolar lows well at all. I'm very calm during my low episodes, just extremely fatigue, overwhelmingly sad, and distant. When I sleep for long hours, my boyfriend takes it personally and feels very victimized. He tends to ask questions almost everyday now. He asks ""Do you love me?"" ""Are you happy with me?"" ""You don't want to do anything with me?""
This is almost heartbreaking and I've repeatedly told him that I'm having episodes and I do my best to ground myself daily but they are very prevalent having bipolar. It feels like there's a part of his brain that will never comprehend the struggle of bipolar being entirely internal and has nothing to do with him. I do believe it is making my episodes worse now that his victimized outbreaks are a daily reaction. He thinks I'm angry at him all the time or ignoring him on purpose or I don't want anything to do with him. I never argue, I just shut down emotionally and get paralyzed to function to talk or even look in the eyes, giving a distant atmosphere often. It turns into me having to comfort him in the amidst of melancholy daily and this energy having to remind him constantly that I love him and it has nothing to do with him is exhausting. 

I have a great relationship with him and we are very caring to each other, but these episodes are affecting him a lot and making me worse with his reaction. 

I really don't know how to explain this to him, I've talked about it endlessly in detail of the reality of BP. I never sent articles or informational sites to him.

,bipolar,"Hello, i hope everything and y’all are okay 🍀
I (26) diagnosed 2 years ago and i have met my exboyfriend (23) in this July while I have been stable for 2 months after a major depression. He was a traveler and my city was his last station. We bounded so fast, had great times together but we were hyping each other. I still don’t know if i have had a slight hypo mania or i was falling in love… Also we both couldn’t understand if it’s love or strong impression. By the time he visited me again, it didn’t go well this time. We had such intense conversations and pointless fights. The last day we decided to save the relationship and he went. We couldn’t make it, wished the best for each other and cut the painter.
After a little while he texted me some very awkward messages and asked to call. In this calling I could sense something was wrong about his mindset, he was talking about creating a new language and that kind of big things. Since we have a long distance I couldn’t do anything but worry. I felt like I was affecting his mind and I felt guilty. We ended talking 2,5 months ago till last Friday, he send my favorite perfume that he ordered while we were talking. I couldn’t take the shipping bcs of the customs. I texted to report what happened before he recoup and say thank you&amp;take care. He didn’t answer three days. I texted again taht “Can you please just send a sign that I can understand if you and we are okay? It beats me and i think we don’t deserve this. Any sign that i can make sense the situation is fair enough”. He said “Hey. We are completly ok. I had a psychosis two months ago. And now I’m trying to get better. It’s a shame that the parfume cannot arrive. I knew it would be a problem but I tried with the lying method.  Didnt work 🤷‍♂️. I hope you’re  doing ok as well. 
Take care” I felt devastated and i still do. I partly blame myself for his psychosis… It was his first serious relationship and came too much for him. Our lives were so different and the affection was unbalanced, he was the one got affected mostly.
I am saying partly because he was using mari since he was 17. Even though I know this is the main and rational reason for psychosis, I also know deeply that I triggered and contributed. when I saw his message I couldn’t stay rational and said “I can’t describe how much i am sorry Josh… I feel terrible about my unintentional contribution for this. At our last call I could sense something but I couldn’t do anything, I’ve felt like whatever I do would be another harm for you. I won’t hurt you again ever, I hope nothing can hurt your beautiful heart. I hope you get better and, the best 🤍” He didn’t respond.
I really feel so bad and I regret what I wrote. I don’t know if he didn’t respond because he blames me, too or we already said goodbye for the last time… I feel like shit.

,bipolar,"I’m writing this post as if to myself, but I figured it would be helpful (mainly for myself tbh) to share it with you folks.

I received my diagnosis a few months ago during the summer, and though my psychiatrist used a lot of words to describe me, the gist of it was that I have Bipolar I Disorder. His actual diagnostic impression was much more nuanced, but it all pointed to the same thing:

There’s something wrong with me; I’m unstable in the most explicit sense of the word.

That’s what it all pointed to, but I’ve come to learn I’m much more than bipolar. I had my first true mania a year ago, and it got so bad (I became psychotic) that I had to withdraw from school and take a semester off.

I came back and I had to withdraw again, this time because I was too depressed. I was in the throes of a cannabis addiction, and things weren’t looking good.

I feel like myself again, though, and I’ve finally got it. I can’t tell you the moment I felt it, but at some point the broken pieces of my life came together like a puzzle. Like kintsugi. I can feel things start to turn around for me, even if I don’t always know with certainty.

Ever since I ‘misplaced my mind’ last year, people look at me differently, and never in my life have I been so solitary. I’ve decided, then, that I need to learn to keep myself company. And I have. My diagnosis is very isolating, but I’ve finally made some peace with it. Mental illness or no, it’s me all the way down, and the people who I care about won’t judge me.

I can’t wait to see how much I improve next year.

,bipolar,"Background story

&amp;#x200B;

I had depression since I was 13 years old. Nevertheless, I studied hard to go to a good college. When I entered my college, the department office tried to open an interview with a decent TV channel. (At least to my professors, I was an exceptionally good case.) I showed the symptoms of depression, but I was unmedicated because I did not know anything about mental health issues. I just thought ""it is what it is"" and bottled up my issues. It was only third year of college that I went to doc. (this was 2017)

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since 2017, I started taking depression meds. Of course, they did not work out. Back then, I did not know I was bipolar. So I worked my ass off WITHOUT the help of mood stabilizers and what not.  Still, (thanks to caffeine and nicotine) I graduated college with a good GPA.

Everything seemed perfect. I started my MA degree at the fall of 2021. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now

However, things got fucked up. In 2021 winter, My first hypomanic episode occurred. I was not hospitalized, but I went to several hospitals to change meds. 

Ever since 2022, I feel like a different person. I think my function is deteriorating. I became lazy and depressed. I could not meet deadlines. I almost failed all classes. It kinda affected my concentration and attention. Very recently I have a hard time reading novels. (I am literature major and I used to read and write a lot)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, all these things being said, do you think I should my career?

I have always considered doing GRE or LSAT to fulfill my life goals. But unfortunately things got fucked up.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think I have to give up and change career? lmao

,bipolar,So I was snug in my depressive episode when a change occured. The second or third day before Christmas Eve rapid cycling began. More manic like days. Major lack of need for sleep. Yet so sad at the same time. I think this new feature is because Christmas is at our house for the first time in a decade. The stress factor went up.

Before it was fine and I didn't mind much even though I am not a morning person, I got used to it, waking in the morning and going to gym but all seems too much. As since this routine is my routine for sometime, it's hard for me to do not follow it. If you get it what i mean. My brain won't let me go gym and if i don't go gym, my day ain't good then cuz I miss my routine and everything is a mess now. And why this is happening? Cuz the gym trainer said I am annoying... Let's be clear he is good guy and nice person in general. He didn't said that directly to me but to my sister. We go gym together. Why he thinks that way? I can only guess cuz I am kinda someone like things organised be it home or gym, if something is our if my organised way, it hard for me do it.

I used to love mornings but lately they're quite challenging. 

I think it might be because my night-time Risperidone has worn off and my morning dose needs a bit of time to kick in, but I always find the first few hours of the day the hardest. It mostly seems to be my energy levels that are affected, I just feel slow and dead in the mornings, but I also feel more anxious and sometimes a little paranoid depending on the day. 

It almost feels like each day I have a mountain to climb, I start off the mountain feeling crappy, then over the first couple of hours of the day I climb up to alright, then by hour 4-5 or so I'm feeling decent, and on good days by hour 7-9 I'll be feeling *good*. Once I'm there I usually stay there for the rest of the day until something happens to throw off my mood, which means every night I'm always dreading going to sleep, because in the night I'm feeling pretty good usually, but at the same time I know the good feeling I have will be gone again in the morning and I'll have to make the climb again.

It's one of the reasons I'm struggling to give up smoking again because in the past I started off weaning off the cigarettes by delaying my morning cigarette as long as possible - but recently my mornings have been rough and those first couple of cigarettes feel like the one thing getting me through it.

,schizophrenia,"hi all,

i’m a fictional author and always trying to include diverse representation in my books. my current work-in-progress is a romance told from the POV of the female main character who falls for the male main character who has schizophrenia. The book is not about the MMC’s schizophrenia, but it is a rather small subplot which i want to be as accurate as possible.

I’ve read through this subreddit a LOT and I have a few unanswered questions:

For those of you that are medicated/in therapy, what are your day to day “symptoms” (forgive me if this is poor terminology)?

Those of you in relationships, what are the best ways your partners have supported you? (Or ways that partners made things harder for you?)

&amp; any other advice I should know? (i.e. poor representations you’ve seen before/things I should avoid?) 

I appreciate this greatly. I can read all day in the DSM-5 or in research journals, but nothing is better than advice straight from the very people I’m attempting to represent. 

To those who reply, if the book gets published (I’m optimistic that it will, but in traditional publishing you never really know), any comments that I utilize in creating this story will get a PM upon completion &amp; I’ll send you a free copy of the novel :)))

It took me one year to get settle myself mentally as I made my journey through the Recovery House. I was on meds, couldn't use to figure out things, was really carefree for another 1 and half year. Then I left my meds, and I realised that I relapsed on schizophrenia. And here I am back from where I started. I was just doing some office work on computer in my father's office since these years.

,schizophrenia,"Hello,

I don’t know if I have this post tagged right, I apologize if it’s not.  I have some questions and I could really use some advice from people who have experience.

My partner recently had a pretty severe psychotic episode with delusions and hallucinations that landed him in the hospital.  We previously thought he had bipolar disorder, but the doctors thought otherwise after what they observed.  He was communicating to aliens, god, getting messages from tv shows, among other things.  He claimed he was channeling aliens, angels, demons.  Yelling in loud voices and shaking around, laughing hysterically at random points.  Then he’d just stare and not respond, occasionally shaking his head or nodding, chuckling — he was communicating with them, he said.  He’d go through periods of really intense negative emotion, happiness, and no emotion — according to him.  At one point he said he was channeling my spirit that was a demon trying to turn into an angel.  Eventually it subsided to a point that was less outwardly visible, but says the aliens/angels are testing him and making him a better person.  They told him not to lie and are making him tell me things that he has been lying to me about for like over 10 years.  I don’t want to go into details, but I’m reeling because I remember the incidents he’s telling me and remember thinking he was lying to me at the time.  I feel sick and feel like I’m in shock.

My question is, I guess — is it possible for his delusions to cause him to become more honest, like compulsively almost, because he says they’re making him a better person and making him tell the truth?  I’m so confused right now.  And the mood swings and staring off into the distance and not responding are scaring me.

He has an appointment with his psychiatrist soon.  He still doesn’t know what’s going on and I don’t think he can really consider that he could be sick.  I’m not sure how to help him right now.  I have a mental illness myself and I feel like I’m losing my sanity.

I’m not judging him, I realize this is rough.  I feel so bad for him.  :(

,schizophrenia,"I’m a young teen and from the age of 13 I started doing drugs like marijuana, vaping, alcohol and eventually shrooms, I am now 9 months sober but after a few months of smoking weed I started having absolutely brutal psychotic episodes. I’m not sure if they are but I looked up the symptoms for example one of them is “religious delusions” which I usually get each episode, my first episode was probably my worst one it went like this. I was in the bathroom smoking weed and I just wanted to get buzzed as usual so I only took one hit, then a few minutes later it kicked in and it was super strong, I only had one hit so either I got laced with something or my brain just gave up on my weed tolerance, the thing is it took days to go away. When I got home I started getting really agitated for no reason and started pacing back and forth, and I started thinking that there was cameras in my room but I noticed from thinking so much my very ability to think was “fading away” and I somehow convinced myself that I had to make a deal with the devil to get my ability to think back, so I continued to pace back and forth in front of my bed and that was the last thing I remembered, after that I woke up 3 days later on my bed with my laptop open on YouTube, also it was a school week and I lived with my parents so I have no idea what happened because usually my mom would force me to go to school.

I’m not sure if they are but I looked up the symptoms for example one of them is “religious delusions” which I usually get each episode, my first episode was probably my worst one it went like this. I was in the bathroom smoking weed and I just wanted to get buzzed as usual so I only took one hit, then a few minutes later it kicked in and it was super strong, I only had one hit so either I got laced with something or my brain just gave up on my weed tolerance, the thing is it took days to go away. When I got home I started getting really agitated for no reason and started pacing back and forth, and I started thinking that there was cameras in my room but I noticed from thinking so much my very ability to think was “fading away” and I somehow convinced myself that I had to make a deal with the devil to get my ability to think back, so I continued to pace back and forth in front of my bed and that was the last thing I remembered, after that I woke up 3 days later on my bed with my laptop open on YouTube, also it was a school week and I lived with my parents so I have no idea what happened because usually my mom would force me to go to school.

,schizophrenia,"Hi guys,  


I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia 6/7 years ago, I had awful delusions and hallucations, I didn't know what was real and what wasn't, my whole personality changed to try and face the new 'reality' that I was living in. However, with a combination of CBT, Ariprazole, Risperidone and Quetiapine (Not al at once, jesus) I managed to crawl my way out of the delusions, and the hallucinations without the delusions are an irritant at worst.  


But I'm still struggling with the negative symptoms 4/5 years later, I thought the emotional issues were potentially a defence mechanism that my brain would eventually repair, but they're still occuring.   


Let me describe what I'm experiencing now:

  
\- Incredibly low ""social battery"", after 30-60 minutes of conversation, my social battery feels completely empty, I can't think of things to say, I can't join in on any jokes, I pretty much go completely non-verbal for 30 minutes until I recharge, in a group this is fine, but 1 on 1 it makes for pretty awkward situations  


\- Emotional blunting/severe apathy, unless I'm intoxicated, I don't feel any emotion towards what people say or do, I don't get defensive, I don't get upset, I don't get offended, I don't find things funny, I don't express gratitude or love properly, I don't express concern etc. Outwardly I can still express these emotions in pantomine, but some people see straight through me and I can come across as fake or ingenuine. Before the schizophrenia I was a very emotionally intelligent and outwardly displaying person, but now I feel like a borderline psychopath emotionally.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sleep issues, I have never been able to sleep correctly, and can only sleep when I'm on brink of passing out from exhaustion. I've managed to get a 12-8 shift at my 9-5 to allow me to fall asleep at 4/5am without major consequence, but I would like to get some insight on this, and see if it's a result of the negative symptoms or just a personal thing, as I've had trouble with sleep ever since I was a child  


I would be interested to know if anybody has faced these same negative symptoms, and potential solutions to properly mitigate them. The fact that I tend to be okay emotionally when I'm intoxicated makes me think there's some sort of psychological block there, but on the other hand, the increased confidence could just improve my self deception. Either way, this tends to make me use alcohol and substances as a crutch when socialising, which I could do without.

,schizophrenia,"I want to preface by saying I currently see a psychiatrist for different things (ASD,ADHD,GAD and MDD). I also have background knowledge in the topic. 

I will also preface, I am NOT looking for a diagnosis or expecting a “magic answer” I’m just looking to compare experiences , familiarities, hear stories etc , to better make sense of my situation. 

Post: 


For the last 6-12 months I have been having lingering depression, which as per my MDD and ASD is not a foreign concept. However this recent period of depression has been without the normal mood components, no suicidal ideation no loss of self worth etc, they are all anhedonia, lethargy and poor self care related + executive dysfunction. I’ve been distancing myself and not wanting any interactions apart from necessary ones (not bizarre given my Autism but it’s more frequent, also could just be burnout).. 

During this time my anxiety has been playing up, when I go to the gym I am paranoid everyone is looking at me and talking about me, staring at me and laughing at me. 

This also happens at work , where I think people are laughing at me, communicating between eachother non verbally and don’t like me. 

At times I also periodically get paranoid my neighbours can see me showering and I sometimes hear noises resembling that thought (window opening, lock noise or a laugh). (Rarely). 

I also get anxious about my air con vent that someone is looking through it (however this was prominent in my teens and was severe so I slept under the blanket for months). 

I have also been noticing more visual illusions, by this I mean in my peripheral vision I sometimes see objects that will periodically take a shape of a person until I look at them centrally and it’s normal. Or sometimes I’ll see floating dots around. (My vision and eye health is fine as per the optometrist) Sometimes I get paranoid I may have seen a human figure too until I look at “them” and it’s nothing or a door for example. (These have been getting more frequent, I’m aware illusions are normal but with their increasing frequency and “severity”)..  they also sometimes take the form of just being shadow spots or a sensation someone has walked behind me.

When walking to my car at night I sometimes get paranoid I’m being followed and sometimes think I hear foot steps following me (assuming this could be an anxiety response). 

Very recently I’ve started laughing out loud to thoughts that come into my head, and sometimes my thoughts just don’t make sense, the other day I made a joke in my mind I was the beacon of truth- that made me laugh out loud lol. (This could also be a self soothing thing with my ASD). 

Further , I’ve been having increasing Deja vu , like every day sometimes multiple times a day. Like a situation or string of words was something that happened before , and preceded a bad event or something bad happening. Almost like a sense of doom but mild.

How was everyone else’s prodrome? Any comparisons/similarities? 

I am aware these symptoms could also overlap with burnout from my ASD, anxiety exacerbating these concerns and my depression being in the background. (? MDD with psychotic features etc). 

I was intrigued at Schizophrenia due to reading a few study’s of the slightly increased % of ASD people in likelihood to develop schizophrenia.

I was in shock. My dad is the sweetest person I know and he has always been really kind and supportive to my uncle (he always had some illness that my family wouldn’t talk to me about). I couldn’t believe what I just heard so I told him that it was complete bullshit and that I don’t understand why he would say such thing. Now I understand that my reaction was terrible but I was in shock and extremely upset. As I have been living abroad for quite some time, I didn’t see the change of his psyche and my family did not want to worry me, this was a lesson to all of us of the importance of communication. 

I had such a diverse mix of emotions: I was angry that he would say something so terrible, I was upset that he was unwell, and that my family kept his condition a secret, and I felt some kind of grief for the loss of his sanity. After crying for two hours I told my mom and grandma about what he said to me and they told me that he had been recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and that his symptoms are getting worse (it was mainly caused by frequent seizures and long term consumption of medications). My grandma also told me about his other delusions and hallucinations and honestly it was very upsetting to hear, my grandma is a hero for taking care of him.

This was my first encounter with a delusion and I reacted extremely poorly. As I am moving back to my homeland I will be having many more encounters so I am seeking guidance. Please share your experiences and tips on how to react and care for diagnosed family members.

Something like the Peanut Gallery, or my passengers, backseat drivers, haters, fan club, etc.

Idk, it just seems like there's a stigma against people who hear voices and sometimes I want to talk to others about it without them being uncomfortable and not knowing how to respond.

There have also been times when I've said things to friends or family about severe hallucinations and delusions I was experiencing that are uncomfortable and serious topics, the nature of which makes it difficult to explain or open up about.

My thoughts was that it would be easier to talk about if I didn't use such ""scary"" language, and to talk about my experiences in a way that makes it easier to empathize with.

So how do you talk about it, and does that help? Also, for those of you who communicate with your voices, how does the way you refer to and treat them help you manage them and cope with what they're saying?

For example, when the voices become overwhelmingly difficult to ignore, I tend to go full mockery mode and make fun of my loudmouths any way I can think of. Sometimes it riles them up and they'll get frustrated, other times they're very insistent on telling me whatever they think will upset me the most. 

Having to manage my voices has become incredibly disruptive to my life, and I'm struggling to even do that when I live in isolation, no one to speak with about it whatsoever (even when I was briefly seeing a therapist, since i never got to talk about it). And that isn't even to mention the fact that I also hear persecutory voices when I see people in public, every time I pass someone by or turn away from them. Still don't know how to deal with that other than confront them and ask them to repeat what they just said (which is obviously the wrong thing to do about it).

Kind of an open series of questions, but I'm interested in hearing anything you have to say on how you deal with voices, how you talk about them, or even just what you experience.

,schizophrenia,"  

A pair of twins were brought up in a Christian home where it was strongly recommended to respect the law and stay away from smoking, drinking alcohol and doing drugs.

Both were brough up blessed having parents that could provide them with necessities and some luxuries. They both went to a private high school. They played hockey for about 7 years, they did triathlons, swimming competitions, passed their alpine skiing instructor class, and were lifeguards on a pool.

The older brother did a good job of complying reasonably with their parents’ recommendations, however the younger one didn’t. The older brother obtained two bachelor’s degrees, a master’s degree and went on to live the American Dream. With wealth, health and fitness, he went on to achieve many accomplishments and obtained good fortune.

The younger brother who didn’t obey his parents consumed recreational drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol abundantly, quit school, developed paranoid schizophrenia, and lived close to a decade on welfare.

The older brother achieved the steps on the track to the American Dream pretty much in a straight, orderly and legal line, while the younger one, as he developed the illness, wandered off the track, explored the unknown and pranced around in off-road fields doing things that were not understood and that were considered as a waste of time.

One day, the younger twin asked for divine intervention at the right place. The same year, he was prescribed efficient medication. One year later, he had a minimum wage part-time job. Two years later, he had a diploma and a full-time job. Four years after that, he had a wife, a car and a condo. Today he is happily married, homeowner and on his way in his 11th year working full-time at a stable job.

To those of you who don’t believe in God, what do you make of this?
