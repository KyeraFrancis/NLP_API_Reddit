,Army,"Happy New Year!

I will have completed my MSO in May '24 and submitted my UQR to leave in June '24.

However this year the unit is supposed to get TCS orders to do something irrelevant to our actual job as a Battalion at a stateside installation in August for a year. I have a great job that I just took that will propel my career and income upward.

I've been pretty vocal that I will not join the unit when they go, as I submitted a UQR but so are many of the other officers who want to go IRR or trying to get out of it (some are still within their MSO).


Got a new BC I haven't spoke to yet due to the limited time at BA and the holidays but I've notified the previous BN CDR and the HHC CDR for their knowledge when I submitted the packet for S1. As far as I know no one has been interviewed as to explain why they can't go as well as a roster scrub hasn't been conducted for whos going.


I've looked up AR 135-175 and the Request for Resignation Unqualified sharepoint  and can't find the answer whether if I can still UQR if whatever reason I get orders or if I'm even eligible to get orders because my MSO ends in May.


I'm sort of sweating and obviously being a reservist with the holidays I have to wait for certain answers. So I wanted to see if anyone has recommendations, input, experience, or an answer in the meanwhile

,Army,"This is a safe place to ask any question related to joining the Army. It is focused on joining, Basic Combat Training (BCT) and Advanced Individual Training (AIT), and follow on schools, such as Airborne, Air Assault, Ranger Assessment and Selection Program (RASP), and any other Additional Skill Identifiers (ASI).

We ask that you do some research on your own, as joining the Army is a big commitment and shouldn't be taken lightly.

,Army," 

Long post ahead of feeling sorry for myself, but I have to vent.

My ETS is in January of 2026.

I am so damn sick and tired of being in the military and the Army I don't know what to do. I've been diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, but I probably have worse problems with my head than that.

I am a shit bag soldier. I'll admit it. I enlisted way older than what I should have joined. Wish I had joined the Air Force but I would have been a shitbag there too, but at least I wouldn't have to worry about the field, group PT, staying in the barracks as an unmarried E4, etc. I have one of the worst jobs in the military, tried to reclass, and failed my reclass, now I'm back to the MOS I tried to escape from.

I've been in since October of 2017. Six years now. Despite getting a company grade article 15 in May of 2018 (smoked in the barracks) I was somehow considered decent enough at my first unit to be given a specialist waiver at my 18 month mark, May of 2019. I haven't been in trouble since then but I'm still a shitbag. I have been a specialist since then.

My next unit (interpost transfer) basically screwed me over repeatedly and just neglected me. Even the first sergeant knew what was going on, so coming to him wasn't going to do a damn thing. Didn't even process my PCS award and when I asked for it, they said ""you'll get it."" They never did process it.

I was told at my three year mark when I was in Greece that I would go to the promotion board. That came and went and I never did go. My last six months at my unit before I reenlisted, I was given AT LEAST SEVEN non-recommendation counsellings and was passed around to a new E5 almost every month, who would then tell me that I hadn't been under them long enough to be recommended. I would have been sent to at least one more E5 if I hadn't left my unit when I did, because my last E5 was getting out. One staff sergeant I had told me ""just because you've been in for over four years, doesn't mean you should go to the board"", and then my retention sergeant told me that that E6 came to him and asked if there was a way to bar me from reenlistment.

Over four and a half years of being a specialist now, and I have still never been recommended for the promotion board.

All these people who were E2's, and even people who weren't even in the Army when I joined, are now E5's while I'm still an unpromatable E4.    I know there's people who've been in for six years who are now E6's or E5 promotables, while I'm still an unpromotable E4 after over four and a half years time in grade and six years time in service.  Whatever.   I get it, there's something very, very wrong with ME, and this just isn't for me. I was trying to reclass so I could have something to fall back one when I got out, and I was trying to reclass to something that was a little ""less Army"" but that blew up in my pathetic face.

**I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of my MOS, I'm tired of the military, and I am just tired of the Army.** I still have nightmares about bad experiences I've had (being in a group of trainees in basic where one guy broke his neck, being with a guy on my MOS with a fire and watching him get burned, myself being burned by an asshole who wasn't paying attention and then blamed me, being grabbed in the balls on duty from behind, etc.. and I still think about failing my AIT when I tried to reclass.)

Now I just show up at the right place and time and uniform and that's it now.

The military and the Army with the morning PT, barracks, field, etc. just isn't for me. I can't wait to just get the fuck out. Take my honorable discharge and just go. If I never do make sergeant, then whatever.  Fuck this. I was told a few years ago ""you'll never be a NCO, never. And ""you don't deserve to be in the Army"" That's fine now. I don't care anymore. All I care about now is finishing my time and preparing to get out.   

I don't want to try to reclass again because for one, I don't want to deal with the extra stupid rules the Army has on even prior service, ON TOP of the general military nonsense (It pissed me off when I had prior service Air Force guys tell me they didn't have to stay in barracks and they did PT on their own, while we prior service Army still had to stay in barracks and do PT and deal with random formations called upon by drill sergeants even in the evening over stupid shit somebody else did.) and 2), I don't want to risk failing the AIT and then I'm RIGHT BACK to my MOS.

Despite getting a company grade article 15 in May of 2018 (smoked in the barracks) I was somehow considered decent enough at my first unit to be given a specialist waiver at my 18 month mark, May of 2019. I haven&amp;#39;t been in trouble since then but I&amp;#39;m still a shitbag. I have been a specialist since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next unit (interpost transfer) basically screwed me over repeatedly and just neglected me. Even the first sergeant knew what was going on, so coming to him wasn&amp;#39;t going to do a damn thing. Didn&amp;#39;t even process my PCS award and when I asked for it, they said &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;ll get it.&amp;quot; They never did process it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was told at my three year mark when I was in Greece that I would go to the promotion board. That came and went and I never did go. My last six months at my unit before I reenlisted, I was given AT LEAST SEVEN non-recommendation counsellings and was passed around to a new E5 almost every month, who would then tell me that I hadn&amp;#39;t been under them long enough to be recommended. I would have been sent to at least one more E5 if I hadn&amp;#39;t left my unit when I did, because my last E5 was getting out. One staff sergeant I had told me &amp;quot;just because you&amp;#39;ve been in for over four years, doesn&amp;#39;t mean you should go to the board&amp;quot;, and then my retention sergeant told me that that E6 came to him and asked if there was a way to bar me from reenlistment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over four and a half years of being a specialist now, and I have still never been recommended for the promotion board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these people who were E2&amp;#39;s, and even people who weren&amp;#39;t even in the Army when I joined, are now E5&amp;#39;s while I&amp;#39;m still an unpromatable E4.    I know there&amp;#39;s people who&amp;#39;ve been in for six years who are now E6&amp;#39;s or E5 promotables, while I&amp;#39;m still an unpromotable E4 after over four and a half years time in grade and six years time in service.  Whatever.   I get it, there&amp;#39;s something very, very wrong with ME, and this just isn&amp;#39;t for me. I was trying to reclass so I could have something to fall back one when I got out, and I was trying to reclass to something that was a little &amp;quot;less Army&amp;quot; but that blew up in my pathetic face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of it all. I&amp;#39;m tired of my MOS, I&amp;#39;m tired of the military, and I am just tired of the Army.&lt;/strong&gt; I still have nightmares about bad experiences I&amp;#39;ve had (being in a group of trainees in basic where one guy broke his neck, being with a guy on my MOS with a fire and watching him get burned, myself being burned by an asshole who wasn&amp;#39;t paying attention and then blamed me, being grabbed in the balls on duty from behind, etc.. and I still think about failing my AIT when I tried to reclass.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just show up at the right place and time and uniform and that&amp;#39;s it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military and the Army with the morning PT, barracks, field, etc. just isn&amp;#39;t for me. I can&amp;#39;t wait to just get the fuck out. Take my honorable discharge and just go. If I never do make sergeant, then whatever.  Fuck this. I was told a few years ago &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;ll never be a NCO, never. And &amp;quot;you don&amp;#39;t deserve to be in the Army&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s fine now. I don&amp;#39;t care anymore. All I care about now is finishing my time and preparing to get out.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to try to reclass again because for one, I don&amp;#39;t want to deal with the extra stupid rules the Army has on even prior service, ON TOP of the general military nonsense (It pissed me off when I had prior service Air Force guys tell me they didn&amp;#39;t have to stay in barracks and they did PT on their own, while we prior service Army still had to stay in barracks and do PT and deal with random formations called upon by drill sergeants even in the evening over stupid shit somebody else did.) and 2), I don&amp;#39;t want to risk failing the AIT and then I&amp;#39;m RIGHT BACK to my MOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my long post of feeling sorry for myself, my question is, I&amp;#39;ve heard different things about when SFL TAP starts. Some of have told me it is 18 months, while others have said no, it&amp;#39;s 12 months. Who&amp;#39;s correct?&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"So, recently I re-enlisted in the NG while deployed, I was in the Kuwait/Jordan Area, and I was re-assured that my bonus would be tax free. I re-enlisted under the idea that I would get a lump sum payment, and that sounded good to me. The bonus was 20k in total.  


Clearly I am posting here cause was because I didn't get 20k. Now, to be fair to the Guard, the total was 20k, truly a lump sum payment. However I am wondering how I might resolve 2 things:  
1: 3k of it went straight to my TSP. I didn't even think that my TSP would take some, and I'm not against putting some in there, but I'm not wanting to put 3k in. I don't get the payout for a few days, can I go ahead and adjust my TSP today and then receive more in hand, OR is it solidified cause I see it in MyPay? How can I go about getting those funds if so?  


2: I got taxed nearly 5k, which, I heard happens. I've heard varied responses such as, ""Submit a copy of your orders/your re-enlistment orders/bonus to finance and wait for your 5k back,"" to, ""You gotta wait till tax time, you'll get it back,"" which because my payout is the 4th of Jan, won't be till next year.

,Army,"Hey hi howdy! Another long post!

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a very holiday oriented person. I legitimately forget holidays are coming up and could not tell you the date of any holiday besides probably July 5th (Huehue). But there is one holiday I never forget, and it could maybe be because it's literally impossible. Like you may forget how many inches are on a ruler, but you definitely know what number it starts with; 0. That's New Years. I fucking love New Years, it a hard set date that marks time progressing forward. Each year is a race to try and do as much as possible before the end of that 20– number. It gets me in this weird philosophical mindset where I dread and embrace the passage of time. Something about changing the year I wrote by muscle memory all year as it was unchanging and concrete, the old one being one I will never write with the same mentality ever again.

&amp;#x200B;

The year that was once the mark of cutting edge modernity,

“um It is literally 2023,  how are we still doing this, get with the times 💅”

&amp;#x200B;

Becomes old, dated, and represents some defining moment of that year we are now moving forward from, moving on. It's now 2024 and we are barreling towards a new great defining moment that we can't predict or plan for.  What's going to be the Defining Moment for humanity? the moment for America? What's going to be the Defining Moment for you?

&amp;#x200B;

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

&amp;#x200B;

I am still a baby faced innocent young man of 23, so years aren't zooming by yet. These things take forever to pass. And I feel like I am a different person at the end of each one. But this year in particular has been the most unending, mindwarpingly, soul-testingly long 365 days of my life. I cannot put it in my head that so much happened in this year, it feels like 4. Every month I am a whole new person, and often at a whole new place in life it seems. I used to do posts here only after every significant developments and achievements happened, but it got to a point that if I kept that up, I'd be posting every week or twice a week and nobody wants that.

&amp;#x200B;

Both to help me get the story straight in my head and to send off the craziest year of my life, here's a wrap up of my 2023. What's yours?

&amp;#x200B;

**THE BEGINNING OF MY YEAR.**

&amp;#x200B;

*One of the most challenging and awful months of my life. I will explain it in extreme detail because it was incredibly difficult and I never posted openly about all of it. Covers me almost dying, me creating the first real army bone marrow program, me joining the boss executive council and getting fired from the executive council.*

&amp;#x200B;

**January 1st -** Started my job with the Bliss BOSS executive council along with two others, we were all collectively going to fully replace the current council.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 15th** \- [I began a two week long marrow donor registry drive at WBAMC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/10ixiaa/bone_marrow_guy_of_fort_bliss_22_yo_spc_currently/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Sourced soldiers to help from my brigade CSM who gave me 6 from different units each day. I did two shifts with 3 in the morning and three in the afternoon, 14 hours total each day. Each day I had to train, manage, and watch the team.  As well as source and ensure I had my team for the next day. I was walking well over 8 miles a day between all my tables and averaging 70+ calls a day managing the team, hospital staff, and sourcing, while also doing my job with BOSS remotely.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 25th -** I did a local news interview, as well as an interview with Army Magazine. Right after I started feeling sick. Progressively getting worse until I had to spend the last 4 hours of the day passed out on a table in an empty conference room I had claimed as my HQ. That same week my [taskandpurpose article](https://www.reddit.com/user/BlissBoneMarrowGuy/comments/10gnj08/task_and_purpose/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) came out finally. It was a big week.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 26th -**  I woke up that morning ungodly sick, I absolutely could not speak.  I texted and told one of my trusted guys that he is going to have to handle today on his own. I wasn't going to make it in. I texted my POC for the hospital, a MSG who reached out on Reddit and made the whole detail possible and let her know. She told me I was dumb if I did not go to the ER and get some meds. I was literally vomiting phlegm every couple minutes and had a 105 temperature and getting worse. I was completely delirious and managed to barely text one of my friends to take me to the E.R. Within an hour I was on a breathing tube and getting emergency surgery. I was just told they were removing my tonsils and draining the extreme swelling. It was so bad they had to put the tube in while I was awake, then immediately put me to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 30th -** [I woke up in the ICU covered in tubes and bruises.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/10qevmd/bone_marrow_guy_of_fort_bliss_another_post_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I was told I had the worst case of a very rare case of tonsillitis called periodontal tonsillitis they'd ever seen. I would have died that day from my throat closing up had I not gone to the E.R. when I did. It took 6 people to hold me down to get the tube in and I almost bit through it, as well as the surgeon's finger when he tried to pry my mouth open. They almost had to do a chest trach. They also had lost my phone in the struggle when it was launched across the room. Took two days for them to find it and my friends and partner having no clue what happened to me. I lost 17 pounds and had acquired some extreme body dysmorphia and muscle dystrophy. My number two guy who I had basically abandoned with only a “you gotta handle today” 5 days prior had continued on with running the hospital drive in my place with no further information from me or any clue what happened. He handled the final two days with no supply refills and no way to actually contact the next day's detail members. But he did what he could. That drive registered 685 people and more than tripled the previous records for hospital registry drives in military history.

&amp;#x200B;

**February 2nd -** I leave the hospital and have to go right back to work. Having learned while I was being recognized by the CG the next day, and going through every drug withdrawal on the planet at the time from what the hospital had me on. It was a rough day. Spent all night sick, achey, and with massive mood swings from the steroid shot withdrawals. Barely fell asleep 2 hours before my wake up time.

&amp;#x200B;

**February 3rd -** Woke up early, got in trouble with the BOSS council for missing my up-text by 3 minutes. I had to make a huge power move today, I almost died and with that, all my efforts gone to nothing. Before today my work was only ever a hobby, with no real goal of where to go with it. [I spent 6 hours that morning typing up and designing a 37 page continuity book, finding a printer, binder, and page protector. I finished minutes before the ceremony, and when the CG gave me my ARCOM, I gave him a challenge coin and the continuity book right back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/12jtz4k/spc_awards_1st_armoured_divisions_2_star/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Saying “With this you can make Fort Bliss the center of marrow donations for the Army for decades to come” and requested a contact at division to help make this effort permanent. He told me he has a division surgeon cell that may be qualified.

I wobbled back home, almost passing out every other step from how weak I was. I expected nothing to come from this.

&amp;#x200B;

**February 16th -** [Today I was invited to attend the ironclad meeting. Basically every single commander and CSM on post gathers each month in one building.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/13ie3jo/bone_marrow_guy_of_fort_bliss_fort_bliss_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I was there to award them this huge sculpted wood femur bone trophy I had been making for almost a year for their (my) achievements for donations. I had gotten no further information from the CG so I had another power move ready to go. My killer right hand man from the hospital drive agreed to help me get ready. We assembled 5 more binders of continuity books and planned to hand them out in the wide open to every medical officer right in front of the division leadership. I expected nothing to come from this either. We were scrambling around trying to buy the stuff. I was at the PX frowning over binder prices and we was off at a print shop when I got a call from the division surgeon cell SGM. He told me they were tasked to work with me to create the OPORD for making my continuity book a full program across Fort Bliss. I dropped to the floor in the middle of the shoppette. We finished the books, awarded the trophy and went on with our day. Once I got in my car later to go get a beer and celebrate it all hit me, and I spent the entire drive and a long time in the parking lot screaming, punching the steering wheel and crying tears of joy for the first time in my life. It was all worth it. All my pain and losses and illness. Once I got my health back, I began obsessing over the gym and eating. Putting on 20 pounds in 3 weeks and eating over 4K calories a day to get back what I lost. I had bought dress pants, chinos and such, after I got out the hospital when I was still dilapidatley skinny for my job at BOSS and put so much muscle on my butt and thighs so quickly I popped the buttons off or tore the back pockets of every single pair of those pants.

&amp;#x200B;

**February - March -** I began building my OPORD for the program with the division surgeon. Pouring my self entirely into my job at BOSS. Obsessing over finding and networking businesses to work with us to have consistent and long term volunteer events with unique places of need within the city. Special needs schools, nursing homes, movie nights at homeless shelters, soul kitchens and pantrys, etc. as well as chess clubs around the city, D&amp;D nights, horse riding, and other things. I wanted the soldiers who never leave the barracks to join events that fit their interests.

&amp;#x200B;

I learned excel and rebuilt [the backend tracking system for BOSS](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/13lb194/i_redesigned_the_fort_bliss_boss_programs_entire/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to allow us to track which brigades are signing up for events and which are not, located and tied in every BOSS rep since the system was completely out of date, and developed ways to keep these reps accountable for ensuring soldiers know about our events.

&amp;#x200B;

**March 16th -** had to get my left shoulder totally reconstructed. My arm and years old grappling injuries and new army injuries had caused it to start dislocating in my sleep. It dislocated around 23 times in the year since I had been at Bliss.

&amp;#x200B;

**April -** recovery from surgery, personal losses. Personal Struggles and professional differences with the new president of BOSS. Feeling like it was time to let BoneMarrowGuy die since there was no further I could go. I was making a division wide permanent program and that's as far as my potential to make a difference. Maybe other divisions will follow, maybe not.

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the end of the month I was facing down serious burnout from everything, those differences at work were so bad I was beginning to document every single things I did every day to the minute. Every conversation and task completed or progressed or failed. I couldn't figure it out and just dived more into even more of a OCD routine to make it work. I was smoking a pack of black and mild's and two beers a day as my only vice.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 2nd -** I was facing down serious burnout, I was making plans to take advantage of a three day weekend to get a bunch of friends and get an AirBnb in the mountain forest two hours away and just take a rest. That day I had invited two great friends to join me and some others to come up. I hadn't kept nearly as close as I should have with them but they told me they wanted to start hanging out again. Two roommates who were absolutely inseparable, literally together 24/7 or on the phone. That night I was at my partners house and got a call from my NCO asking if I was okay, because there were a bunch of MPs and an ambulance at the barracks. I figured another rowdy combat engineer night or someone burned a pizza again. Or maybe something else.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 3rd -** At 1300 I got curious and called a friend of mine while at work. I casually asked “was it a suicide” he said yes and I asked with disconnected attention if he knew who. He said it was my friend, the one I had spoken to yesterday. I fuckin ran out of the office and immediately started calling trying to figure out where her friend was. I got a hold of their 1SG and was told she was in the hospital and would be back soon. I went to the store and bought every goddamn grocery, cooked days of meal prep and waited until I was told she got back and dropped it all off at her door.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 4th -** that night I stayed up all night with a SSG from my company talking to him about how to deal with it. I had a mason jar with the fanciest rum drink on the planet, chopped up fruit garnish everything. I finally went to bed at 4AM with it untouched next to me. Overslept by hours because my phone had died with my partner on the line. Woke up to a knock at my door, it was the BOSS president. I was fired an hour later by phone call.

&amp;#x200B;

I went up to cloud Croft that weekend with a bunch of friends and reset. Grieved, paid my respects and came back an entirely new man. I was ready and excited to come back to my company. I was now deploying in 2 months, **July 15th.**

&amp;#x200B;

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

&amp;#x200B;

Rebirth of Bone Guy.

&amp;#x200B;

I started diving right back into this effort. Any time I went through a struggle this things was always there for me. I wanted to help others do more drives and spent my time getting ready for deployment and building up a team of volunteers across the Army.

&amp;#x200B;

**June 28th -** I met with Mario Terenas, the former 10th Mountain division CSM and now deputy chief of AUSA’s Center for Leadership. We were connected through the journalist for Army Magazine who had become a dear friend of mine. That call changed my entire perspective for this efforts possibility. It didn't just end at Bliss for me. It could and WILL be an Army wide program. He invited me to attend the AUSA national conference and made dozens of promises to introduce me to important leaders in the mean time. He asked for the products I had so he could show them off. I had none lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to decide. Do I deploy or pursue this opportunity. I joined the Army so I could see more of the world than my little ghetto I grew up in. This was my only chance. Everyone I knew was going. Or do I try and stay, make another sacrifice for the pipedream of chasing this. Could I really make an army wide program? I chose to roll the dice. I planned for weeks for this meeting. We went on spring block leave and I spent the entire time at my computer preparing. Networking, creating products, researching, and planning for one big power move. An open door with my brigade CSM to convince him that this is worth pursuing. Or maybe he will convince me it's not.

&amp;#x200B;

**July 1st -** [my Army magazine article comes out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/14w32bi/im_in_the_army_magazine/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

J**uly 6th -** I met with my CSM. 8 days from my flight date. His first day back from block leave. I had everything he could say and my perfect answer prewritten and memorized. I had a big SITREP typed up with a timeline plan blocked out for the rest of the year leading to the conference. I was ready. It was just supposed to be a brief about my efforts, but it quickly segued into “how would this deployment affect it.” “Greatly CSM” and 7 minutes later I was officially staying. He just had to figure out where. My MOS was being dropped from my brigade so I wasn't going to have a job either way.

&amp;#x200B;

**July 12th -** I met with CSM Light, the 1AD CSM for the first time. He read over my SITREP and plan, and listened carefully to everything I had to say. He told me my place was right here at division and he would have me moved shortly. He just didn't know where to fit me yet.

&amp;#x200B;

**July 15th -** My Flight date for my deployment passes me by. I remain right where I was at. Now Rear-D for 2nd BDE

&amp;#x200B;

I basically existed without a unit for the next month. I got my tonsils removed and spent all my week days with a self assigned 9-8 work schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

**August 7th -** the day I got my ability to speak back I began meeting with every unit in post and planning one of the largest bone marrow donor registry drives in Army history. Every unit in bliss.

&amp;#x200B;

**August 14-19th -** I got a detail of soldiers dedicated to helping me. [Went to 22 battalions over these 5 days running registry events. 2-5 a day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/15qxo61/the_fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_the_largest_donor/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

**August 22nd -** I started my first day at my new company. Running the orderly room for division.

&amp;#x200B;

[I went to the field, learned my job. Began working to fix the rosters for division while still networking and helping my team get events done and meetings done.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/14xwg97/fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_operation_ring_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

**September -** Every waking moment of my life. 19 hours a day 7 days a week of dedicated to transforming this from a hobby to a full fledged program. Building a Google share drive that would allow every single person who wants to get involved to have premade tools, walkthroughs, presentations, resources, and guides for everything they could possibly need.

&amp;#x200B;

\-[We now accounted for 77% of all registrations in the Army for the year of 2023.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/16nxf24/last_year_fort_bliss_accounted_for_57_of_army/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

\-[I was spending every day getting absolutely everything perfect for the AUSA Conference.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/171hyga/ama_operation_ring_the_bell_a_grass_roots/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)It was the biggest chance we'd ever get and we had to show up ready for absolutely anything because he had absolutely zero information.

&amp;#x200B;

**October 8th-12th -** [We went to the conference.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/18dw2am/fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_how_a_bunch_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Met with almost every army leader imaginable. Pitching our program to every leader from the division level to the Chief of Staff. [Passing out a hundred one-page hitters and 65 wooden SPC coins that were my business cards.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/175wjzy/i_spent_every_minute_of_the_army_national/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

**October 13th -** [Attended the Army National Guard Commanders conference.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/17cwsds/i_somehow_managed_to_convince_the_national_guard/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I gave a speech in front of every single national guard general alive and give the general my coin.

&amp;#x200B;

**October 14th -** Visited the Salute to Life Labs and learned everything about the process of extracting HLA typing from samples. Got every bit of mystery removed from the process.

&amp;#x200B;

Spent the weekend hanging out in DC with my best friend who drove up. One of the best Saturday club nights of my life lol.

&amp;#x200B;

**October 18th -** Flew back home and hours later went to the field.

&amp;#x200B;

**October 25th -** Debriefed the CSM and he decided he wanted me to do this full time. Moving me into the G6 section of division HQ.

&amp;#x200B;

**October 30th -** began working at G6 Help desk

&amp;#x200B;

\-Got a random phone call from the SMA office. Didn't know they were allowed to do that. The SMA wanted to follow up on my work, and wanted to know how he could help. Was told MEDCOM would be reaching out soon.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of the month of November is me doing meetings, calls, scheduling trips and planning out the new year and it's trips and meetings.

&amp;#x200B;

**November 28th -** ArmyTimes article comes out.

&amp;#x200B;

**November 1st -** Got moved to G6s VTC section because it lined up better with my work schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

**November 2nd -** Got moved to the imaging room section because I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

**November 4th -** MEDCOM called me.

&amp;#x200B;

**November 8th -** Got moved back to the Help desk because low staffing.

&amp;#x200B;

**December 3rd -** December 6th - [Took my first ever TDY for the program.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/18a80a6/my_first_ever_tdy_for_the_bone_marrow_program_off/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Went to Fort Cavazos and met with 1st CAV, 1st MED BDE, III Corps. As well as did some events. [As well as drive around feeding soldiers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/18c1pms/i_went_to_the_1st_med_bde_summit_and_at_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

**December 7th -** moved to the division surgeon cell to now fully run this program with guidance from staff officers. The first 25s to ever be attached to the surgeon cell. The first ever SPC to work in that office. Ever confused. I wasn't even a part of the conversation. Just got told the day I got back.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of the month is just meetings meetings meetings I can't post about just yet. I don't like to post uncertainties or things in progress you know what i mean? ;)

&amp;#x200B;

This has been the absolute hardest year of my life. I cannot cope with the amount of loss and gain and growth and success and failures I've experienced in such a short time. This doesn't even cover all of it. I really cannot wrap my head around how much has happened in so little time. One year, and enough to fit a whole career. How do I fit all of this into my identity? How can I get any of the ego I have to have for what all is coming next when all of that success is marked by so much loss and failure and sacrifice to get there? I don't know. But I cannot bring into words how much this community means to me in its support and encouragement. So many times I've felt totally lost, and I could just dive back into this community and this work and find myself again.

&amp;#x200B;

Shoutouts to some of the realest Homies on the sub. There are a ton of people who I want to shout-out but these active users are such great parts of what makes this community so amazing to be a part of.

Another long post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a very holiday oriented person. I legitimately forget holidays are coming up and could not tell you the date of any holiday besides probably July 5th (Huehue). But there is one holiday I never forget, and it could maybe be because it&amp;#39;s literally impossible. Like you may forget how many inches are on a ruler, but you definitely know what number it starts with; 0. That&amp;#39;s New Years. I fucking love New Years, it a hard set date that marks time progressing forward. Each year is a race to try and do as much as possible before the end of that 20– number. It gets me in this weird philosophical mindset where I dread and embrace the passage of time. Something about changing the year I wrote by muscle memory all year as it was unchanging and concrete, the old one being one I will never write with the same mentality ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year that was once the mark of cutting edge modernity,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“um It is literally 2023,  how are we still doing this, get with the times 💅”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becomes old, dated, and represents some defining moment of that year we are now moving forward from, moving on. It&amp;#39;s now 2024 and we are barreling towards a new great defining moment that we can&amp;#39;t predict or plan for.  What&amp;#39;s going to be the Defining Moment for humanity? the moment for America? What&amp;#39;s going to be the Defining Moment for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still a baby faced innocent young man of 23, so years aren&amp;#39;t zooming by yet. These things take forever to pass. And I feel like I am a different person at the end of each one. But this year in particular has been the most unending, mindwarpingly, soul-testingly long 365 days of my life. I cannot put it in my head that so much happened in this year, it feels like 4. Every month I am a whole new person, and often at a whole new place in life it seems. I used to do posts here only after every significant developments and achievements happened, but it got to a point that if I kept that up, I&amp;#39;d be posting every week or twice a week and nobody wants that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both to help me get the story straight in my head and to send off the craziest year of my life, here&amp;#39;s a wrap up of my 2023. What&amp;#39;s yours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE BEGINNING OF MY YEAR.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the most challenging and awful months of my life. I will explain it in extreme detail because it was incredibly difficult and I never posted openly about all of it. Covers me almost dying, me creating the first real army bone marrow program, me joining the boss executive council and getting fired from the executive council.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 1st -&lt;/strong&gt; Started my job with the Bliss BOSS executive council along with two others, we were all collectively going to fully replace the current council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 15th&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/10ixiaa/bone_marrow_guy_of_fort_bliss_22_yo_spc_currently/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;I began a two week long marrow donor registry drive at WBAMC.&lt;/a&gt; Sourced soldiers to help from my brigade CSM who gave me 6 from different units each day. I did two shifts with 3 in the morning and three in the afternoon, 14 hours total each day. Each day I had to train, manage, and watch the team.  As well as source and ensure I had my team for the next day. I was walking well over 8 miles a day between all my tables and averaging 70+ calls a day managing the team, hospital staff, and sourcing, while also doing my job with BOSS remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 25th -&lt;/strong&gt; I did a local news interview, as well as an interview with Army Magazine. Right after I started feeling sick. Progressively getting worse until I had to spend the last 4 hours of the day passed out on a table in an empty conference room I had claimed as my HQ. That same week my &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/BlissBoneMarrowGuy/comments/10gnj08/task_and_purpose/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;taskandpurpose article&lt;/a&gt; came out finally. It was a big week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 26th -&lt;/strong&gt;  I woke up that morning ungodly sick, I absolutely could not speak.  I texted and told one of my trusted guys that he is going to have to handle today on his own. I wasn&amp;#39;t going to make it in. I texted my POC for the hospital, a MSG who reached out on Reddit and made the whole detail possible and let her know. She told me I was dumb if I did not go to the ER and get some meds. I was literally vomiting phlegm every couple minutes and had a 105 temperature and getting worse. I was completely delirious and managed to barely text one of my friends to take me to the E.R. Within an hour I was on a breathing tube and getting emergency surgery. I was just told they were removing my tonsils and draining the extreme swelling. It was so bad they had to put the tube in while I was awake, then immediately put me to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 30th -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/10qevmd/bone_marrow_guy_of_fort_bliss_another_post_and/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;I woke up in the ICU covered in tubes and bruises.&lt;/a&gt; I was told I had the worst case of a very rare case of tonsillitis called periodontal tonsillitis they&amp;#39;d ever seen. I would have died that day from my throat closing up had I not gone to the E.R. when I did. It took 6 people to hold me down to get the tube in and I almost bit through it, as well as the surgeon&amp;#39;s finger when he tried to pry my mouth open. They almost had to do a chest trach. They also had lost my phone in the struggle when it was launched across the room. Took two days for them to find it and my friends and partner having no clue what happened to me. I lost 17 pounds and had acquired some extreme body dysmorphia and muscle dystrophy. My number two guy who I had basically abandoned with only a “you gotta handle today” 5 days prior had continued on with running the hospital drive in my place with no further information from me or any clue what happened. He handled the final two days with no supply refills and no way to actually contact the next day&amp;#39;s detail members. But he did what he could. That drive registered 685 people and more than tripled the previous records for hospital registry drives in military history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2nd -&lt;/strong&gt; I leave the hospital and have to go right back to work. Having learned while I was being recognized by the CG the next day, and going through every drug withdrawal on the planet at the time from what the hospital had me on. It was a rough day. Spent all night sick, achey, and with massive mood swings from the steroid shot withdrawals. Barely fell asleep 2 hours before my wake up time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 3rd -&lt;/strong&gt; Woke up early, got in trouble with the BOSS council for missing my up-text by 3 minutes. I had to make a huge power move today, I almost died and with that, all my efforts gone to nothing. Before today my work was only ever a hobby, with no real goal of where to go with it. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/12jtz4k/spc_awards_1st_armoured_divisions_2_star/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;I spent 6 hours that morning typing up and designing a 37 page continuity book, finding a printer, binder, and page protector. I finished minutes before the ceremony, and when the CG gave me my ARCOM, I gave him a challenge coin and the continuity book right back.&lt;/a&gt; Saying “With this you can make Fort Bliss the center of marrow donations for the Army for decades to come” and requested a contact at division to help make this effort permanent. He told me he has a division surgeon cell that may be qualified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wobbled back home, almost passing out every other step from how weak I was. I expected nothing to come from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 16th -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/13ie3jo/bone_marrow_guy_of_fort_bliss_fort_bliss_is/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;Today I was invited to attend the ironclad meeting. Basically every single commander and CSM on post gathers each month in one building.&lt;/a&gt; I was there to award them this huge sculpted wood femur bone trophy I had been making for almost a year for their (my) achievements for donations. I had gotten no further information from the CG so I had another power move ready to go. My killer right hand man from the hospital drive agreed to help me get ready. We assembled 5 more binders of continuity books and planned to hand them out in the wide open to every medical officer right in front of the division leadership. I expected nothing to come from this either. We were scrambling around trying to buy the stuff. I was at the PX frowning over binder prices and we was off at a print shop when I got a call from the division surgeon cell SGM. He told me they were tasked to work with me to create the OPORD for making my continuity book a full program across Fort Bliss. I dropped to the floor in the middle of the shoppette. We finished the books, awarded the trophy and went on with our day. Once I got in my car later to go get a beer and celebrate it all hit me, and I spent the entire drive and a long time in the parking lot screaming, punching the steering wheel and crying tears of joy for the first time in my life. It was all worth it. All my pain and losses and illness. Once I got my health back, I began obsessing over the gym and eating. Putting on 20 pounds in 3 weeks and eating over 4K calories a day to get back what I lost. I had bought dress pants, chinos and such, after I got out the hospital when I was still dilapidatley skinny for my job at BOSS and put so much muscle on my butt and thighs so quickly I popped the buttons off or tore the back pockets of every single pair of those pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February - March -&lt;/strong&gt; I began building my OPORD for the program with the division surgeon. Pouring my self entirely into my job at BOSS. Obsessing over finding and networking businesses to work with us to have consistent and long term volunteer events with unique places of need within the city. Special needs schools, nursing homes, movie nights at homeless shelters, soul kitchens and pantrys, etc. as well as chess clubs around the city, D&amp;amp;D nights, horse riding, and other things. I wanted the soldiers who never leave the barracks to join events that fit their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned excel and rebuilt &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/13lb194/i_redesigned_the_fort_bliss_boss_programs_entire/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;the backend tracking system for BOSS&lt;/a&gt; to allow us to track which brigades are signing up for events and which are not, located and tied in every BOSS rep since the system was completely out of date, and developed ways to keep these reps accountable for ensuring soldiers know about our events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 16th -&lt;/strong&gt; had to get my left shoulder totally reconstructed. My arm and years old grappling injuries and new army injuries had caused it to start dislocating in my sleep. It dislocated around 23 times in the year since I had been at Bliss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April -&lt;/strong&gt; recovery from surgery, personal losses. Personal Struggles and professional differences with the new president of BOSS. Feeling like it was time to let BoneMarrowGuy die since there was no further I could go. I was making a division wide permanent program and that&amp;#39;s as far as my potential to make a difference. Maybe other divisions will follow, maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the month I was facing down serious burnout from everything, those differences at work were so bad I was beginning to document every single things I did every day to the minute. Every conversation and task completed or progressed or failed. I couldn&amp;#39;t figure it out and just dived more into even more of a OCD routine to make it work. I was smoking a pack of black and mild&amp;#39;s and two beers a day as my only vice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 2nd -&lt;/strong&gt; I was facing down serious burnout, I was making plans to take advantage of a three day weekend to get a bunch of friends and get an AirBnb in the mountain forest two hours away and just take a rest. That day I had invited two great friends to join me and some others to come up. I hadn&amp;#39;t kept nearly as close as I should have with them but they told me they wanted to start hanging out again. Two roommates who were absolutely inseparable, literally together 24/7 or on the phone. That night I was at my partners house and got a call from my NCO asking if I was okay, because there were a bunch of MPs and an ambulance at the barracks. I figured another rowdy combat engineer night or someone burned a pizza again. Or maybe something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 3rd -&lt;/strong&gt; At 1300 I got curious and called a friend of mine while at work. I casually asked “was it a suicide” he said yes and I asked with disconnected attention if he knew who. He said it was my friend, the one I had spoken to yesterday. I fuckin ran out of the office and immediately started calling trying to figure out where her friend was. I got a hold of their 1SG and was told she was in the hospital and would be back soon. I went to the store and bought every goddamn grocery, cooked days of meal prep and waited until I was told she got back and dropped it all off at her door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 4th -&lt;/strong&gt; that night I stayed up all night with a SSG from my company talking to him about how to deal with it. I had a mason jar with the fanciest rum drink on the planet, chopped up fruit garnish everything. I finally went to bed at 4AM with it untouched next to me. Overslept by hours because my phone had died with my partner on the line. Woke up to a knock at my door, it was the BOSS president. I was fired an hour later by phone call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went up to cloud Croft that weekend with a bunch of friends and reset. Grieved, paid my respects and came back an entirely new man. I was ready and excited to come back to my company. I was now deploying in 2 months, &lt;strong&gt;July 15th.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebirth of Bone Guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started diving right back into this effort. Any time I went through a struggle this things was always there for me. I wanted to help others do more drives and spent my time getting ready for deployment and building up a team of volunteers across the Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 28th -&lt;/strong&gt; I met with Mario Terenas, the former 10th Mountain division CSM and now deputy chief of AUSA’s Center for Leadership. We were connected through the journalist for Army Magazine who had become a dear friend of mine. That call changed my entire perspective for this efforts possibility. It didn&amp;#39;t just end at Bliss for me. It could and WILL be an Army wide program. He invited me to attend the AUSA national conference and made dozens of promises to introduce me to important leaders in the mean time. He asked for the products I had so he could show them off. I had none lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to decide. Do I deploy or pursue this opportunity. I joined the Army so I could see more of the world than my little ghetto I grew up in. This was my only chance. Everyone I knew was going. Or do I try and stay, make another sacrifice for the pipedream of chasing this. Could I really make an army wide program? I chose to roll the dice. I planned for weeks for this meeting. We went on spring block leave and I spent the entire time at my computer preparing. Networking, creating products, researching, and planning for one big power move. An open door with my brigade CSM to convince him that this is worth pursuing. Or maybe he will convince me it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 1st -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/14w32bi/im_in_the_army_magazine/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;my Army magazine article comes out.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J&lt;strong&gt;uly 6th -&lt;/strong&gt; I met with my CSM. 8 days from my flight date. His first day back from block leave. I had everything he could say and my perfect answer prewritten and memorized. I had a big SITREP typed up with a timeline plan blocked out for the rest of the year leading to the conference. I was ready. It was just supposed to be a brief about my efforts, but it quickly segued into “how would this deployment affect it.” “Greatly CSM” and 7 minutes later I was officially staying. He just had to figure out where. My MOS was being dropped from my brigade so I wasn&amp;#39;t going to have a job either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 12th -&lt;/strong&gt; I met with CSM Light, the 1AD CSM for the first time. He read over my SITREP and plan, and listened carefully to everything I had to say. He told me my place was right here at division and he would have me moved shortly. He just didn&amp;#39;t know where to fit me yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 15th -&lt;/strong&gt; My Flight date for my deployment passes me by. I remain right where I was at. Now Rear-D for 2nd BDE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I basically existed without a unit for the next month. I got my tonsils removed and spent all my week days with a self assigned 9-8 work schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 7th -&lt;/strong&gt; the day I got my ability to speak back I began meeting with every unit in post and planning one of the largest bone marrow donor registry drives in Army history. Every unit in bliss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 14-19th -&lt;/strong&gt; I got a detail of soldiers dedicated to helping me. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/15qxo61/the_fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_the_largest_donor/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;Went to 22 battalions over these 5 days running registry events. 2-5 a day.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 22nd -&lt;/strong&gt; I started my first day at my new company. Running the orderly room for division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/14xwg97/fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_operation_ring_the/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;I went to the field, learned my job. Began working to fix the rosters for division while still networking and helping my team get events done and meetings done.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September -&lt;/strong&gt; Every waking moment of my life. 19 hours a day 7 days a week of dedicated to transforming this from a hobby to a full fledged program. Building a Google share drive that would allow every single person who wants to get involved to have premade tools, walkthroughs, presentations, resources, and guides for everything they could possibly need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/16nxf24/last_year_fort_bliss_accounted_for_57_of_army/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;We now accounted for 77% of all registrations in the Army for the year of 2023.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/171hyga/ama_operation_ring_the_bell_a_grass_roots/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;I was spending every day getting absolutely everything perfect for the AUSA Conference.&lt;/a&gt;It was the biggest chance we&amp;#39;d ever get and we had to show up ready for absolutely anything because he had absolutely zero information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 8th-12th -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/18dw2am/fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_how_a_bunch_of/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;We went to the conference.&lt;/a&gt; Met with almost every army leader imaginable. Pitching our program to every leader from the division level to the Chief of Staff. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/175wjzy/i_spent_every_minute_of_the_army_national/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;Passing out a hundred one-page hitters and 65 wooden SPC coins that were my business cards.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 13th -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/17cwsds/i_somehow_managed_to_convince_the_national_guard/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;Attended the Army National Guard Commanders conference.&lt;/a&gt; I gave a speech in front of every single national guard general alive and give the general my coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 14th -&lt;/strong&gt; Visited the Salute to Life Labs and learned everything about the process of extracting HLA typing from samples. Got every bit of mystery removed from the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent the weekend hanging out in DC with my best friend who drove up. One of the best Saturday club nights of my life lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 18th -&lt;/strong&gt; Flew back home and hours later went to the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 25th -&lt;/strong&gt; Debriefed the CSM and he decided he wanted me to do this full time. Moving me into the G6 section of division HQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 30th -&lt;/strong&gt; began working at G6 Help desk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Got a random phone call from the SMA office. Didn&amp;#39;t know they were allowed to do that. The SMA wanted to follow up on my work, and wanted to know how he could help. Was told MEDCOM would be reaching out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the month of November is me doing meetings, calls, scheduling trips and planning out the new year and it&amp;#39;s trips and meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 28th -&lt;/strong&gt; ArmyTimes article comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 1st -&lt;/strong&gt; Got moved to G6s VTC section because it lined up better with my work schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2nd -&lt;/strong&gt; Got moved to the imaging room section because I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 4th -&lt;/strong&gt; MEDCOM called me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 8th -&lt;/strong&gt; Got moved back to the Help desk because low staffing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 3rd -&lt;/strong&gt; December 6th - &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/18a80a6/my_first_ever_tdy_for_the_bone_marrow_program_off/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;Took my first ever TDY for the program.&lt;/a&gt; Went to Fort Cavazos and met with 1st CAV, 1st MED BDE, III Corps. As well as did some events. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/18c1pms/i_went_to_the_1st_med_bde_summit_and_at_the/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;As well as drive around feeding soldiers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 7th -&lt;/strong&gt; moved to the division surgeon cell to now fully run this program with guidance from staff officers. The first 25s to ever be attached to the surgeon cell. The first ever SPC to work in that office. Ever confused. I wasn&amp;#39;t even a part of the conversation. Just got told the day I got back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the month is just meetings meetings meetings I can&amp;#39;t post about just yet. I don&amp;#39;t like to post uncertainties or things in progress you know what i mean? ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been the absolute hardest year of my life. I cannot cope with the amount of loss and gain and growth and success and failures I&amp;#39;ve experienced in such a short time. This doesn&amp;#39;t even cover all of it. I really cannot wrap my head around how much has happened in so little time. One year, and enough to fit a whole career. How do I fit all of this into my identity? How can I get any of the ego I have to have for what all is coming next when all of that success is marked by so much loss and failure and sacrifice to get there? I don&amp;#39;t know. But I cannot bring into words how much this community means to me in its support and encouragement. So many times I&amp;#39;ve felt totally lost, and I could just dive back into this community and this work and find myself again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoutouts to some of the realest Homies on the sub. There are a ton of people who I want to shout-out but these active users are such great parts of what makes this community so amazing to be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"I’m a 21 year old dude and I’ve been strongly considering enlisting. 

As a general background I’ll be starting my last semester of college soon, and after that will be graduating with a degree in Sport Management. 

For a variety of reasons I feel like I chose the wrong degree. However my mistake has left me with 25k in debt. My plan prior to considering enlisting (a recent idea) was to move back home with my parents and work off my debt until I can become financially independent. 

But now at 21, I want to get out of the house and get on with life. However I will soon have a degree I don’t want that only affords me jobs I don’t want to work. My home environment is terrific and I have wonderful parents, but I feel “trapped” due to my situation and don’t see how I’m going to get out. The other issue is I don’t know what I want and feel like I lack purpose 

For this reason I see three options:

1- apply and look for jobs using this degree that I don’t want, work said job long enough to get out of the house, and get rid of my debt then decide what to do

2- go to grad school, take on more debt, use the advanced degree to get a job closer to what I want (which I don’t know). This decision I feel like is going to leave me in the same situation as I am now but just delay it by a few years

3- Enlist. Live as cost minimum as possible, serve my country (fulfilling the need for a purpose), pay off debt, open job opportunities within the service

Essentially I am transitioning &amp; got a offer to take a 120 day skill bridge internship with General Dynamics.   The only issue is that I have 87 days of leave on the book and the program goes for 120 days. It would start in April &amp; end August 1st my final day of my contract. 

My direct SNCO wants me to be able to use it because he truly thinks that my current unit doesn’t need me as I am not used for anything but the rest of my Chain isn’t too much on board because they want me to “Train my replacement” who would arrive after the start date. Im in one of those units in which we honestly have Marines for the sake of having Marines.  Like that one commander that doesn’t use his Marines but will never admit it because he enjoys the idea of having extras on standby.

Here is where I have a issue.

1. The command I am apart of is Top heavy and as you know in Top Heavy commands Sergeants don’t do much.
2. If I go on skill bridge the command won’t approve my leave and there reasoning for is that Im supposed to use my leave dates for skillbridge which I know is false &amp; their stubbornest will make me have to sell 80+ days when I dont do anything at all.
3.  The Average work day is from 0800 - 1500 and I am serious.  It is literally a ghost town come 1430/1500. On top of that I don’t even do anything. Seriously I spend 90% of the day on youtube because my job is just misc stuff they don’t want to do like organizing files.  It usually two meetings day then every one goes home.
4.  I find it hard to think that they can’t afford to lose but others in the shop can go TAD for sports games.


How should I go about doing this.

Coming from a 6 year reservist. I dont care what bullshit you have against reservists or the current marine corps. What keeps you guys going, is the spirit. The spirit to keep it together to do your thing. Whatever it is. 

But tonight, we celebrate. Another year gone by. I love the corps. For its marines,  Its history, and their ability to adapt and overcome. I hope I’m not the only one.

Well tonight, I just wanted to say, I hope you are all safe, comfortable, and with good company. Nothing better than a group of leathernecks and go getters. The world is expecting. Hold your own and keep it together right?

I’m here for you. I can’t help but know there are some of you here tonight looking for a voice. Something to read. I’ve been there. I love you guys and girls. You’re doing what needs to be done, but with little gratitudes…marines don’t need gratitude. We know we’re good to go. But it takes a lot to admit that we do need some camaraderie. 

Too all you killers out there, I hope your in good spirits, good health, and good company. Don’t neglect. Do yourself something no one else would do. Hit the gym. Hit the chow hall. Go out with the group. Be kind and hit hard when it counts.

If yalls plan is to distract commands and have their attention at 1443 go ahead and assume some initial success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink responsibly so those on duty  tomorrow don&amp;#39;t have a worse night than already being on duty. One of the said memes (from DD214memes) for yalls time, can&amp;#39;t imagine if there is actually a Cpl Hyde and how many calls they will be getting but that person is a meme in and of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

,USMC,"Not sure if the picture helps but is there a way you can tell if the Inactive Duty Points ""NonPaid"" (-it shows the number 4 second row down) relate to Disability Income taken in lieu of ""drill pay""?  We've run into this before YEARS ago-forgot about the $100/month disability he was receiving but he was also Active reserves  collecting drill payments and we had to write a check for almost $4000 to   
 reimburse because they continued VA payments throughout the years.

He was rated 100% disabled end of 2019- and I think we ran into this again. 

He was an 0-6 with 28 years of service. Is there a way someone can look at thisandcan calculate:

The second link has some of my data breakdowns.

When filtered by branch, a lot of the questions had trends that matched the overall answers. I didn't spend time making separate graphs for those because it looks the same as all the answers combined. The branches match, the only difference is how many in each branch answered the question.

Welcome back from your research. Here's the deal, I fully realize that this little ~~fetish~~ census is flawed in several fashions. Here's my shit list of all the ways I fucked this year's census up. If any of you have suggestions for next year that I haven't already discussed, hit up my inbox. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

* I only noticed that I didn't include a question asking which branch you're a part of after 13 people already submitted answers. Fixed it live from my phone, but still.
* My dumbass listed warrant ranks as CW-02 instead of CWO-2.
* I busted my own deadlines! Sinceriously sorry about that. I vastly overestimated my bandwidth and writing this up repeatedly fell to the bottom of the to do list.

Anyways, now that I've taken some time to look a bit deeper than face value at all this data here's what I've found.

# Basic Facts

* Y'all made 1,123 submissions. The ratio of branch submissions shaped how most questions were answered. In most charts, the disparity of answers per branch matched the disparity below. I only bothered making my own charts if I saw a trend that broke from this mold.
   * Air Force: 462
   * Army: 258
   * Coast Guard: 85
   * Marine Corps: 69 ^(nice)
   * Navy: 107
   * Space Force: 70 ^(tried too hard for nice)
   * Blank: 72
* I didn't make a chart for the question regarding your unit encouraging attending sick call or medical appointments, but I did notice something unique. The Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, and Space Force all increased in submissions as the likelihood of encouraging attendance increased from 1 to 5. The Navy was about even across 1 to 3, but did have more submissions for 4 and 5 proportional to the other services. Then, the Marine Corps were roughly equal in submissions across all 5! They really are a cult. Look, real talk for a moment. Don't sacrifice your body for your service if you're supporting peace time ops. And if you do, don't chaff getting rated with the VA as if you didn't earn it. Y'all take care of yourselves!
* Also, there were a few questions that I thought were easy pickings for branch comparisons even if the Google Forms results don't show it that way. I've made a little imgur gallery for six of them that y'all can check out [here](https://imgur.com/a/xgKqDEd). Probably fun for the number nerds out there but I'm not sure who else gets down like that, so...

# Generals

* Three of you claim to be generals in our midst! One is plausible... but the other ""two"" I'm not so sure about. While all three ages match (50+), two of y'all are AH-64 Apaches serving as ""Class IX"" employees in the Army, commissioning with a degree in cunnilingus, would rather fight 3x other generals than other ranks, use condoms 24/7 as COVID preventative measures, claimed spanking as their highest form of punishment (though I have a feeling it wasn't punishment for the receiver since their favorite form of supervisors correcting troops without paperwork is using ball gags), and would implement Titty Tuesday if they were \[AH-64 Apache\] For a Day. You know, just your based pervert, basically.
* On second thought I think the plausible one is probably u/SilentD testing the submission form... so no Generals this time around. Don't worry, you can be my Lieutenant General anytime, boo! o7
* Also, there's something to be said about our willingness to pose anonymously as any of the General ranks... but not a single soul nutted up to be a CWO-5. Y'all know you'd get force choked even thinking about it, haha.

# Levels of Punishment

* You know, I think the one who listed 'marriage' and another who listed 'heavy spanking at home' should probably get together.
* More than a couple of you got 'your balls smoked off' or some variation like 'Just had my ass smoked. Made 20-year old me sit down and take a breather like a 45 year old at their first BJJ practice,' lol. I appreciates handling the situation old fashioned and off the books.
* There was a fair amount of extra duty and paperwork for juniors and seniors being on an episode of When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong. Good reads if y'all wanted to grab some shovels.
* The Marine Corps had the lowest 'None' and 'Verbal' responses among the branches, but the highest 'Extra Duty' and 'Administrative Paperwork', with the second highest 'Article 15'. Conversely, the Space Force had the highest 'None'. I think we all saw those coming a mile away, lol.

# THERE I WAS...

I handle the THERE I WAS question Clint Eastwood style through the categories of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. The Good are tales that are lighthearted, funny, or of benefit to the storyteller. The Bad are tales of fucking up somewhere in the chain and leaves a downer taste in your mouth. The Ugly are tales that give me a bit of a cringe as I read them. These responses are cherry picked exactly as submitted; no edits have been made.

* The Good
   * When I first check on my ship they put us in an overflow berthing where marines were supposed to stay. They’re was HUGE dent in one of the bigger stand up lockers. After about a month someone had the video of happened, several marines used a singular marine as a battering ram and slammed his in the locker several times without a helmet. The also broke all of washer and dryers on board in a similar way with the writing of “broken courtesy of the USMC""
   * Baghdad 2007, walk in fresh off the plane, Army Col looks up, sees me, says ""come with me."" Go into a section, he yells for the SFC, who comes running. He tells the SFC, ""This is SSgt XXX, he is your new section chief. Understood!?"" SFC replies yes. I didnt get it then, but within two weeks, it was perfectly clear. On his NCOER, under leadership, I wrote ""the only reason anyone follows this man is to see what he will fuck up next.""
   * I got bitched at by an Air Force E6 for using profanity when talking to other Army E4’s (combat wounded guys in the hospital with me) told we weren’t professionals talking like that…AND THEY (USAF) WERE AUTHORIZED TO WEAR CROCS IN PTS BECAUSE IT WAS HOT
   * \[Editor's Note: I'm not going to put them in here because they're COALITION and not JOINT you numbskulls, but there's several funny short stories about working with other nations if'n you wanted to go diggin'.\]
* The Bad
   * It wasn't a group but I did my Corporal's Course at Henderson Hall in DC. My unit was actually on Fort Meade, MD but this was the nearest we could get for the course. They put us up in army barracks. It was so bad, rats ate through our cammies. We had to hang all our shit from the ceiling otherwise they would chew through it. I lost 3 pairs of pants and a blouse that they had eaten through...
   * I was an Air Force Academy cadet on exchange to the Naval Academy. I can definitely say that my school (Air Force) is a college where we put on uniforms and pretend to be in the military. Navy was a real military academy. There were pros and cons to both. Navy had way better esprit de corps, but Air Force had infinitely more common sense with what seemed like very obvious shit. Case in point. If it's late hours at the Naval Academy and you require medical attention for anything (including emergencies), you are supposed to call the duty officer, have him or her coordinate a ride to the hospital an hour away, have them inform your chain of command, and only then can you actually go to the hospital. If anyone in that chain doesn't pick up their phone... well.. hope the problem isn't \*too\* urgent. The Air Force by contrast, the sequence is; wake up anyone with a car, get to the hospital, and \*then\* figure out who you need to contact for accountability.
* The Ugly
   * There I was in a Joint Command. Of all branches, Army is the only one that does not have a functioning SHARP or EO Program. Someone comes on the net on the watch floor that wanted to file a Sexual Harassment complaint. I had been trying for 6 months to get audience with the CDR with Stars on his chest to let him know about this deficiency, to no avail (because the lack of EO Program meant we didn’t have an Open Door Policy either, as noted by the Element CSM at the time who is now thankfully retired). It was embarrassing that no one in the Army Element anywhere could tell this SM, or the CMSgt in the AF, where our Soldiers could file a complaint to receive help. We’re doing better on the SHARP Program over a year later, but we still haven’t had any presence from an EOA in the Command
   * \[Editor's Note: I won't put any one particular in here to not belabor the point, but damn there are quite a few stories about the Navy's E-O divide, competency, and fitness.\]

# King / Queen for a Day Hits

* \[These were givens, honestly\]
   * B E A R D S
   * Actually releasing for the day when the work is done
   * BETTER PAY HOLY SHIT PLEASE PASS THE 30% JR ENLISTED PAY
   * Homesteading
* If a command doesnt immediately start an investigation into a report of sexual harassment, sexual assault or regular assault the senior person with knowledge of the allegation is relieved for cause.
* Step Promotion is decided by trial by combat.
* Boot bands not being required for some friendly bonding.
* \[Honorable Mention\] Space Force Chief Master Sergeants are now referred to as “Master Chiefs” (Same response I gave in the 2020 census because this is, in fact, the hill I’m willing to die on)
* \[Dishonorable Mention\] Everyone has to watch a season of anime every quarter.

# Branch Retention

* Air Force: 75.96% (Next highest: 7.93% I'd go back in time to punch myself in the face)
* Army: 29.33% (Next highest: 26.67% Air Force)
* Coast Guard: 75.32% (Next highest: 12.99% I'd go back in time to punch myself in the face)
* Marine Corps: 58.33% (Next highest: 20.00% Air Force)
* Navy: 38.30% (Next highest: 26.60% Air Force)
* Space Force: 61.90% (Next highest: 19.05% Air Force)

So... if you didn't re-pick your same branch, you're likely to cross into the AF. Except if you're already AF or a Coastie, in which case you already know the truth, haha. Also, the Puddle Pirates are only willing to go into the CG, AF, or SF in that order. Zero were willing to cross into the blue, green, or red. When it comes to the Marines, they only branch they refuse to fuck with is the SF. The Navy refuses to join the Marines. And finally, the SF refuses to join the Army or Marines. Makes total sense, but I get a kick out of seeing the instinct we all have validated here.

Now, unless any of you have other questions or things you'd like to see from the data set I'm going to look away and try to get my eyes to stop bleeding.",t2_bdev9,False,,0,False,Military Subreddit Census 2023 Results,[],r/USMC,False,7.0,purple,0,,,False,t3_18u8lxz,False,dark,0.92,,public,11,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,11,,False,False,self,1703947442.0,,[],{},,True,,1703916222.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.USMC,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, ladies and gents, the results are in! While &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the results are viewable with the first link, questions that have user input instead of pre-defined answers are typically displayed very poorly in this view. Also, there&amp;#39;s no ability to filter any of the results to begin to compare branches or to analyze trends. That&amp;#39;s where this &lt;a href=""https://media0.giphy.com/media/A9KfKenpqNDfa/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e476jgwq0kipfh55xiwgtelrf3zfbytrdo1gktp7psh&amp;amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;amp;ct=g""&gt;fucking nerd&lt;/a&gt; comes in! The second link has some of my data breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When filtered by branch, a lot of the questions had trends that matched the overall answers. I didn&amp;#39;t spend time making separate graphs for those because it looks the same as all the answers combined. The branches match, the only difference is how many in each branch answered the question. Booooooooring. Without further ado, the results!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JxkwKNacCGXIs1Ys-1ppZGl75XFWDh4nsyYGlSbgBbs/viewanalytics""&gt;Military Subreddit Census 2023 Results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back from your research. Here&amp;#39;s the deal, I fully realize that this little &lt;del&gt;fetish&lt;/del&gt; census is flawed in several fashions. Here&amp;#39;s my shit list of all the ways I fucked this year&amp;#39;s census up. If any of you have suggestions for next year that I haven&amp;#39;t already discussed, hit up my inbox. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only noticed that I didn&amp;#39;t include a question asking which branch you&amp;#39;re a part of after 13 people already submitted answers. Fixed it live from my phone, but still.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My dumbass listed warrant ranks as CW-02 instead of CWO-2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I busted my own deadlines! Sinceriously sorry about that. I vastly overestimated my bandwidth and writing this up repeatedly fell to the bottom of the to do list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, now that I&amp;#39;ve taken some time to look a bit deeper than face value at all this data here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Basic Facts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y&amp;#39;all made 1,123 submissions. The ratio of branch submissions shaped how most questions were answered. In most charts, the disparity of answers per branch matched the disparity below. I only bothered making my own charts if I saw a trend that broke from this mold.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: 462&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Army: 258&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coast Guard: 85&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marine Corps: 69 &lt;sup&gt;nice&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navy: 107&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space Force: 70 &lt;sup&gt;tried too hard for nice&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blank: 72&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t make a chart for the question regarding your unit encouraging attending sick call or medical appointments, but I did notice something unique. The Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, and Space Force all increased in submissions as the likelihood of encouraging attendance increased from 1 to 5.

And if you do, don&amp;#39;t chaff getting rated with the VA as if you didn&amp;#39;t earn it. Y&amp;#39;all take care of yourselves!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, there were a few questions that I thought were easy pickings for branch comparisons even if the Google Forms results don&amp;#39;t show it that way. I&amp;#39;ve made a little imgur gallery for six of them that y&amp;#39;all can check out &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/xgKqDEd""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;On second thought I think the plausible one is probably &lt;a href=""/u/SilentD""&gt;u/SilentD&lt;/a&gt; testing the submission form... so no Generals this time around. Don&amp;#39;t worry, you can be my Lieutenant General anytime, boo! o7&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know, I think the one who listed &amp;#39;marriage&amp;#39; and another who listed &amp;#39;heavy spanking at home&amp;#39; should probably get together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than a couple of you got &amp;#39;your balls smoked off&amp;#39; or some variation like &amp;#39;Just had my ass smoked.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There I was in a Joint Command. Of all branches, Army is the only one that does not have a functioning SHARP or EO Program. Someone comes on the net on the watch floor that wanted to file a Sexual Harassment complaint. I had been trying for 6 months to get audience with the CDR with Stars on his chest to let him know about this deficiency, to no avail (because the lack of EO Program meant we didn’t have an Open Door Policy either, as noted by the Element CSM at the time who is now thankfully retired).

# Ego: ""I ain't hurtin' no one, so what's it matter?""

When the Marine starts to think the rules aren't beneficial, what others will be broken?

If you're showing your command and peers a lack of self-care, and self-discipline, then what are you gonna try to get away with when NO ONE is looking, hm? That's the worrisome part! That's why everyone's on your butt, man. Do ya get it?  This is a ""red flag"".

If you're lax on trimming on your own damn bushes then how lax are you gonna be clearing out those bushes obstructing your field of fire. If I was your TL, I'd be constantly concerned about you.

# Pride: ""I'm putting out more than them, I deserve a break""

When the Marine starts to think that he's too entitled to tuck his shirt in while he's working because it's hot and he's working on something big and important for the team. Maybe he just got back from a long 7 day mission and he just wants to sit in the chow hall with his gym shirt on. That tells me that you're not always gonna put out 100%. You know there's a time and place for a break, for a gym shirt, for R\&amp;R; but breaking protocols in front of a unit that's bonded on the structure and discipline and uniformity of it's men is not the time and or place. 

Remember the head shaving process, the issuance of the same uniforms for everyone? What about when 1 marine screwed up, do you remember your entire team getting punished along with you? You all lost that right to be a one man band when you joined the Corps! Now you're part of a corps, THE CORPS.

You've heard it said before, but do you really know what esprit de corps means?

It's the feeling of comradery, fellowship, unity and pride all felt by the same group.

But when the Marine starts to not follow the rules like everyone else, they start to etch away at that comradery. A cancer that eats it's own body must be stopped before it spreads

,USMC,"BLUF:  need feedback on whether y’all see value in taking everything that works from Reddit’s military subreddits and merging it into a Rally Point-style service that isn’t toxic and actually works.

Hi all, I had originally posted this to r/army, but the subreddit’s rule 3 won’t allow it through. To be clear, this is not an ad for a service, but rather a post to gauge interest in a project I’ve been working on with some friends. Any and all feedback on our idea would be greatly appreciated! 

This idea sparked after observing the mixed feelings within the online military community regarding the Rally Point website. 

To quote a post by u/BrokenRatingScheme:

""It's full of sycophant active duty members and surly, self-important retirees that firmly believe, with the entirety of their being, that their often incorrect opinion is the only one that matters, and the opinion of anyone not in their MOS/below their (retired) rank is worthy of scorn and mob-mentality chastisement.

It's like LinkedIn where everyone senior to you can be as rude and self-fellating as they want, because what are you going to say? You're one GAL lookup away from someone contacting your leadership and letting them know you were perceived as disrespectful. It's an echo chamber social network.""

This, combined with the positive dynamics of r/army, inspired us to create a platform that merges the best of both worlds: the community spirit of the military subreddits with the service member-focused intent of Rally Point.

Our aim is to emulate the app Blind's format, while offering an anonymous and supportive environment. Here’s our current take on the pros and cons of both platforms:

Rally Point:Pros:
* Specifically built for service members.
* [Your input on other positives would be greatly appreciated.]
Cons:
* Toxic culture dominated by rank.
* No anonymity.
* Lacks a supportive environment.
* User interface challenges.
* Overly serious, lacking in community engagement.

Reddit military subreddits:Pros:
* Balances serious discussion and casual interaction.
* Strong, helpful community.
* Anonymity respected.
* no rank games and big-dickmanship
* Effective moderation.

Cons:
* Navigational challenges.
* Valuable discussions can get lost.
* Dependent on Reddit's guidelines.
* no internal navigation to pages or sub-groups for specific needs (like subpages for mentoring/mental health assistance/shitposts/unit specific/MOS specific/post ETS job search etc...)

This list is by no means all-inclusive and I'd welcome any and all input on it.Is this something that you would use/benefit from? And If you all think this is an asinine idea I'd be happy to hear that too, as my ultimate goal is to create a service that people actually want, and feel they could benefit from.

I’ll take a double chicken chalupa with a Coke and  side of Gabagool

TLDR: building an app, is it something you’d be interested in?

""Dear user,

As you may know, your elected officials in North Carolina are requiring us to verify your age before allowing you access to our website. While safety and compliance are at the forefront of our mission, giving your ID card every time you want to visit an adult platform is not the most effective solution for protecting our users, and in fact, will put children and your privacy at risk.

In addition, mandating age verification without proper enforcement gives platforms the opportunity to choose whether or not to comply. As we’ve seen in other states, this just drives traffic to sites with far fewer safety measures in place. Very few sites are able to compare to the robust Trust and Safety measures we currently have in place. To protect children and user privacy, any legislation must be enforced against all platforms offering adult content.

The safety of our users is one of our biggest concerns. We believe that the best and most effective solution for protecting children and adults alike is to identify users by their device and allow access to age-restricted materials and websites based on that identification. Until a real solution is offered, we have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in North Carolina.

,bipolar,"Hi all, want to share my experience in case it's useful to others (and it's just my experience, some have had it much worse, or different I know).

**DIAGNOSIS**

* One year ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar Type II.
* Key symptoms were a 15 year history of long bouts of depression (and anxiety, which I received a round of psychologist appointments for each time, roughly every 2 years coinciding with big life events/change), very serious plans to join the 27 club, and hypomanic episodes getting more frequent (cycling between depression and hypomania with no normwl time in between for 6 months+). Also, history of it in my family sealed the deal for the psychiatrist to diagnose me. This was all triggered by a massive change in my life and a loss.
* I was convinced I was coping alright throughout this whole time of acute struggle. I enjoyed hypomania, it was a nice release from the dullness of depression, I got super into hobbies and could deep clean everything, not need sleep, feel crazy energy, but it does get to a point of crisis by the end of a super saiyan week where my decisions got weird and I was a bit out of touch with reality, saying and doing whatever, then a dreaded comedown. Depression was awful of course, but it's not my first rodeo, and had enough strategies in place to wait it out. Note that I didn't really recognise hypomania at the time, I didn't know anything about BDII.
* Why I finally decided to seek help was not because I was cared about myself, but because I was losing my memory (lack of sleep related? I'll never really know) and was worried I would hurt someone else inadvertently. I was often losing focus in a big way while driving, just for 30 seconds going into a dreamlike state not knowing what I was doing or where I was - that's enough to drift into an innocent person coming the other way (and I live in a rural area so people are going 100km/h or 60mph, pretty much instant death if you crash). Worst memory fail was trying to fill out a form and not being able to recall my own name, lucky I had ID on me so I eventually remembered and got through it.

**TREATMENT**

* From a doctor's appointment to a psychiatrist to be available was 3 months.
* Two resources I found helpful in the first few months to learn about it all, were the free workbook from [CCI](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Bipolar) (a website I was recommended by a psychologist in my depression/anxiety era), and [Bipolar II Disorder Workbook](https://www.newharbinger.com/9781608827664/the-bipolar-ii-disorder-workbook/).
* Started mood tracking so I could accurately tell my psychiatrist what I needed. I started lamotrigine on daily 25mg, slowly increased to a daily 100mg - my mood stabilised on that amount so psychiatrist agreed I could keep on that unless something changed.
* I found the psychiatrist experience great - it was like all my struggles were acknowledged as real (idk, sometimes psychologists seemed to suggest that it was a thinking/attitude problem you could solve and it was frustrating) and he was just matter-of-fact and it was validating.
* Didn't feel the need to go back to a psychologist. Had a bad experience with my last attempt and I have a lot of helpful strategies from my last 5 or whatever. Talking about yourself is exhausting. Wouldn't recommend neglecting this side of treatment though, I am going to try again.

**OUTLOOK**

* I've still had a couple of hypomanic episodes this year, and a few bouts of depression - but they are way less severe and don't last as long as they used to, therefore it's much easier to maintain a normal-ish life. I've got a steady job again, and feeling more stable.
* Memory and focus have basically returned. I feel a bit dulled and slow to understand, only sometimes but it's nothing too noticeable. I write everything down.
* Told my immediate family, and one friend (who also shared another diagnosis with me, so it felt safe to share with her), and that's it. They're chill, don't think they really understand it and I've appeared high-functioning most of my life (mostly because I self-isolate whenever I have an episode, like a werewolf haha). I don't think I'll tell anyone outside of that group.
* Things I'm still struggling with — accepting the diagnosis and reconciling it with my identity. Don't like the idea of taking a pill for the rest of my life. Feel a bit exhausted and hopeless thinking about the future, just experiencing this over and over. I also just don't want to be constantly aware of my mental health, it'd be nice just to not worry for a while.
* This year I'm going to find a good psychologist again, and request DBT instead of CBT (think I've got everything I can out of it). I *know* there's hope for the future, but I need to work out how to *feel* it. I also need to build up a better support network (how, I'm yet to work out), and get some healthy routines going, because you can feel like shit without that, even when you're not technically depressed.
* Things I've found helpful - keeping a daily record (3 memorable/grateful moments, and a mood rating; 1-7, 1 being dangerously depressed, 7 being dangerously manic, 3-5 being a normal range of moods), stream of thought journalling once or twice a week. Keep a simple list of easy things that improve your mood and tick what you managed to do each day.

,bipolar,"Tw: suicidal, self hatred, could be triggering? + working towards self improvement.

I turn 19 on January 1st which is in an 40 minutes and I feel like shit.

This year I self sabotaged to the max, I wasn’t the best person, lost friendships because I was too suicidal to be around and a ticking time bomb, they never knew if I was going to die or not and left. (I never made it anyone’s problem, I tried to keep this side of my life from them but they’d hear about my self destructive behavior from others such as my parents that have big mouths and love to speak about my suicide attempts/hospitalization to gain sympathy from others. It cost me my friendships because what I tried to do to myself allegedly hurts them).

I ended a relationship I was happy in because I genuinely thought I was going to end my life. She refused to let me leave her but I knew I couldn’t drag her down my path. I felt guilty about staying with her knowing she could do better than be with someone who wasn’t sure of their future. I eventually left her and it broke her, she hates me now but blames herself for not being able to fix me when that was never her problem to fix in the first place. 

This year I was nothing but a major headache to the people in my life and myself, I’m surprised I made it to this day. 

I don’t want to ruin my life, I want to give this life a chance once again. I started new meds, got back in contact with my therapist that I ghosted and have a psychiatric appointment on Tuesday. I hope 2024 is a year of healing and hopefully not as much self destruction.

Final transformation

Again

Been here 

But it’s changed 

Not scared

Blanket on my eye lids 

I can contort

I’m a a counterfeit 

Rearrange my morals

Replace like a cork

From survive 

To celebrate 

Wanna have that cork explore the ceiling once more

So when I’m manic, this inferno of a Ferris wheel awaits 

Shake all that is a bore

Lie to get by

Been on rails that made me want to die 

Hotel rooms feel like coffins

Don’t want love—need an essence

I’m going to get nauseous 

It gets me claustrophobic 

Can’t hide

My bunker eroded

Live like a spilt drink

Hope nobody notices 

Can’t dwell when you are nervous 

Generate and run

Life splits like atoms 

I am particles

,bipolar,"Social isolation is the main star of all the manifestations of my depression. This time is taking so long and has ruined so many good things in my life. It's been 4 months of extreme social anxiety, that extends to my phone. I (24F) can't even read the texts my friends send bc then I'd have to realize how stupid depression makes me act. Everyone knows how I disappeared sometimes. But this time I got diagnosed. I know that's a good thing and I finally have have a chance with meds, but I'm just wallowing in my self isolating bubble coming to terms with everything I've done and trying to forgive myself. 

Since February I really believed I would never be depressed again, and this became a certainty over the following months. But this disease is at its core a masterclass of self sabotage. Icarus is the perfect metaphor.

It's agonizing remembering how I was thriving 6 months ago, on an academic level as well in relationships with friends and SO. The persona who's a social butterfly, out of my hometown, worker-student. My personality, confidence and strength are robbed from me every single time depression comes knocking on the door. My plans and hopes are washed away by the great tsunami of pain and doubt, once again. 

I just needed to vent a little bit. I've been stable but this afternoon just hit me how sad it is to be spending this night alone, because I don't have the energy to pretend everything is okay, until it is. 

I'll probably need to change meds. I'm on 100 sertraline and 50quetiapine (1st time). I need to figure out with my doctor if the quetiapine is dragging me down, bc sertraline/fluoxetine seem to  have worked faster in my previous episodes. I'm from Portugal so sorry about any mistakes.

Broken, a word that has a hold unforgiving
The world knows that 
Yet untried in the court of matter is the error of fixing
To fix something means it was broken 
Am I then broken, if I need to be fixed
I never remember breaking 
Only waking to find I am all over the floor
The glue never seals only colors the floor
Seaping to ever crack leaving nothing untouched
I want to clean up the mess but I am the mess
How can I clean with no arms 
How can I fix what is broken if the tool is broke too
Am I then to be broken forever
Let the heavens open and fix my sores
See the angels as they clean the blood soaked floor
See the devils gambling my soul for fools gold

I wanted to share it in hopes that it reaches people who can feel the same, and know there not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broken, a word that has a hold unforgiving
The world knows that 
Yet untried in the court of matter is the error of fixing
To fix something means it was broken 
Am I then broken, if I need to be fixed
I never remember breaking 
Only waking to find I am all over the floor
The glue never seals only colors the floor
Seaping to ever crack leaving nothing untouched
I want to clean up the mess but I am the mess
How can I clean with no arms 
How can I fix what is broken if the tool is broke too
Am I then to be broken forever
Let the heavens open and fix my sores
See the angels as they clean the blood soaked floor
See the devils gambling my soul for fools gold

i ran out of my meds last week i think? and i’m physically ill so i have no energy to get more.  i desperately struggled my way through the last semester.  i isolated and i lost friends and spent too much time in bed.  i didn’t do nearly as much cleaning or studying or exploration into hobbies as i’d hoped.

i used to be so motivated in the past.  i had so much zeal for life when i was younger that has just slowly ebbed away, leaving me with all these dreams and aspirations for the future and absolutely no drive to achieve anything.  anhedonia has stripped me of my will.  of my pleasure.  i want to do so many things and i just can’t get myself to even try anymore.  i don’t feel like a human being anymore.  i haven’t for years.  i don’t know why i’m here.

i spend so much time in depression that the occasional hypomania is actually really nice, i feel energy and motivation and drive and it’s great and all until i look at my bank account.  until i realize i’ve been acting chaotically.  but the depression always, always comes back, no matter what i do.  i’m so tired.  i just want to function at a basic level, be able to shower and take care of hygiene regimentally, be able to hand my class work in on time, be able to interact regularly with other people, be able to invest time in the things i enjoy rather than staring at a screen for hours like a zombie.

i went to a psych ward for the first time this year.  it was… a lot.  it was a week long involuntary hold and i felt like i got forcefully kidnapped.  i’m determined never to go back again.  i was there rightfully i guess and have the scars to prove it, they managed to get a court order and all, but involuntary always sucks doesn’t it?  i don’t think i actively want to die anymore at least, but i don’t seem to know how to live either.  i don’t know if i want live yet.  i am simply surviving.  all i have been doing this year and longer is surviving.  

i’m in therapy.  i’m (usually) on meds.  and they do make me feel better, like i’m just barely floating, but i’m always just waiting to be pulled under water again.  it’s a vicious and exhausting battle with my own mind.  i’m so tired of fighting constantly.

This is happening to me lately, and I'm not delusional/manic/psychotic.  


I'm my usual anxious self, occasionally paranoid, sometimes depressed.  


But  their behavior is negatively impacting my mental health, in a way where  I can see them feeling like they've proven themselves right about their  preconceptions.  


They're bringing up content from my one and only  psychotic episode around 10 years ago, which was caused by  stress/drugs/lack of sleep/abuse at home. I still sometimes get a bout  of paranoia regarding things/delusions I was in the past worried about,  I'm not delusional anymore about them though and it's kind of a ptsd  type of thing where I might experience fleeting anxiety on it.  


They  communicate about it using subtext. As an example (not a real one  that's happening), say I'm overweight, my dad might start talking about  his overweight colleague and describing characteristics about them that  are similar to mine, while giving me a certain look. I'm fully aware  that this may sound like a delusion of reference, in the past I have had  those, but I have also established during periods of stability that my  dad does communicate this way at times in order to make people feel  insecure. My sibling who is mental stable-ish (narcissist imo) also agrees he does this often.  


When I call them out on their behavior they deny it.  But they Definitely are doing this, which is stressing me and fulfilling  their confirmation bias. I can tell even me noticing and bringing up  what they're doing, in their mind confirms their false narrative.  


It's  frustrating because as I said it stresses me, but I'm simply not at all  worried/delusional about the things they're implying that I am.  


I  am now stressed about their distorted views on me though, and the fact  that I'm pretty sure they're now spreading this narrative to others. And  they have triangulated various family members against me.  


Any  one else experienced this? How do you get people to see that you're  doing okay (at least not anything like as bad as the way they think).  


In  the past this kind of gaslighting has severely impacted my mental  health, and I still struggle sometimes with paranoia particularly during  times of stress. I'm not sure if they know that their approach is  counterproductive, but I don't know how, or if, I should try to  communicate that.  


Sadly my family members are all pretty  dysfunctional and quite abusive and narcissistic at times, so I might be  wasting time trying to get them to be reasonable, but I'm not ready to  move out yet either.  


I also think on some level they want to see  me stressed to make themselves feel ""bigger"", I'm usually treated as the  family scapegoat for context.  


Any tips welcome,

But i literally can’t. i’ve sat up for the past hour and half just thinking and my heart keeps beating faster and my mouth feels fuzzy and i start crying but literally for 10 seconds because i don’t feel anything. I wish i could cry or something that shows some fucking emotion.
On the other hand i have to be up in 5 hours and i took melatonin 2 hours ago and im tired but not mentally tired. My eyes feel heavy but i cant sleep. I want to go get a shower and start getting ready for the day now but i cant. I just want to feel something. This makes me want to relapse to fucking feel something.&lt;/p&gt;

For anyone who uses or is planning on using cannabis, I would suggest that you do a bit of research because there is evidence that it can have an impact on different aspects of bipolar disorder as well as treatment. Also, if you take medications it may be best to talk to a professional like a psychiatrist or pharmacist regarding that because there could be interference.

Here are a few articles about this with their time of publishing:

These are just a few of the many articles on this topic and they're very easy to find. Though, many articles are about cannabis-use disorder in people with bipolar rather than the effects it has, but it doesn't take too long to sort through. That being said, there are very limited studies around this specific topic and even then a lot of the research can’t be entirely conclusionary. This isn't to say that you should not consider the research that has been done or not look into it yourself because you definitely should it's just good to look at it knowing all the variables.

(BTW! I reread the rules before I wrote this because I wanted to make sure this didn't break them and I don't think that it does. If I misinterpreted something and this does I apologize.)

Also, don't use this as an opportunity to try and encourage people to not take their medications or to question the validity of actual pharmaceutical treatment, this is nowhere near my intention for this post and I cannot stress enough the importance of actual medical treatment under the supervision of a medical professional.

,bipolar,"This is just me expressing emotion that i havent been able to express before. So I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder by a psychiatrist after suffering for a long time with what doctors (GP's) thought was Major Depression.
Reading up on what people have experienced because of this illness, what people have lost because of it, makes me feel understood in some way I guess? Reading about aggression for the smallest things like loud volume or other stuff that make others think we're just full of shit. Or about how people go into such dark depressive episodes that it feels like the world is closing in.
I feel relieved knowing that there's hope in that I can now start using what is hopefully the right medication,  I've been on antidepressants and antipsychotics but now they've added a mood stabilizer which should kind of balance things out I guess. 
I've struggled, like really struggled with my mental health for a very long time and nobody has ever really understood why my mood would flip on a dime or why I'd be incredibly happy one day, waking my partner up at 4am because I've got these grand ideas that I just have to speak to somebody about and then wanting nothing to do with anybody the next without anything triggering mee
I feel pathetic looking back because the signs were there, I just wasn't a good enough advocate for myself. But I hope things will be different now that I've taken the appropriate steps and hopefully gotten the right diagnosis.
I think the biggest challenge going forward will be home- My partner and some family aren't the most understanding people and even having this diagnosis and them knowing what it's about won't change anything. In their eyes, I'm still selfish when I don't want contact with people for days on end or I'm still overly short-tempered when I have my moments (I am not justifying how I act and react, I know I can be the biggest asshole at times and it eats away at me and I always promise I'll be better but it never works)
I started quatepine twice a day as an introductory dose while will be increased up to 300mg and left at 300mg once a day about 2 days ago and I told my family I don't want visitors (I'm in hospital rn) and I slept the entire day after being given the medication- In my partners eyes, I'm this selfish prick for not talking to him and checking up on him. I'm going to struggle with opening up to my family and to therapists but it's ultimately something I've got to do if I want to become stable I guess.
Does anybody have advice for me? Especially if you were diagnosed as an adult after years of misdiagnoses and family fights.

,bipolar,"This is happening to me lately, and I'm not delusional/manic/psychotic.

I'm my usual anxious self, occasionally  paranoid, sometimes depressed.

But their behavior is negatively impacting my mental health, in a way where I can see them feeling like they've proven themselves right about their preconceptions.

They're bringing up content from my one and only psychotic episode around 10 years ago, which was caused by stress/drugs/lack of sleep/abuse at home. I still sometimes get a bout of paranoia regarding things/delusions I was in the past worried about, I'm not delusional anymore about them though and it's kind of a ptsd type of thing where I might experience fleeting anxiety on it.

They communicate about it using subtext. As an example (not a real one that's happening), say I'm overweight, my dad might start talking about his overweight colleague and describing characteristics about them that are similar to mine, while giving me a certain look. I'm fully aware that this may sound like a delusion of reference, in the past I have had those, but I have also established during periods of stability that my dad does communicate this way at times in order to make people feel insecure.

When I call them out on their behavior they deny it. But they Definitely are doing this, which is stressing me and fulfilling their confirmation bias. I can tell even me noticing and bringing up what they're doing, in their mind confirms their false narrative.

It's frustrating because as I said it stresses me, but I'm simply not at all worried/delusional about the things they're implying that I am.

I am now stressed about their distorted views on me though, and the fact that I'm pretty sure they're now spreading this narrative to others. And they have triangulated various family members against me.

Any one else experienced this? How do you get people to see that you're doing okay (at least not anything like as bad as the way they think).

In the past this kind of gaslighting has severely impacted my mental health, and I still struggle sometimes with paranoia particularly during times of stress. I'm not sure if they know that their approach is counterproductive, but I don't know how, or if, I should try to communicate that.

Sadly my family members are all pretty dysfunctional and quite abusive and narcissistic at times, so I might be wasting time trying to get them to be reasonable, but I'm not ready to move out yet either.

I also think on some level they want to see me stressed to make themselves feel ""bigger"", I'm usually treated as the family scapegoat for context.

,bipolar,"Well, I don’t think I’m the first to say this but… this sucks. It’s really hard for me to tell other people that I’m bipolar (I got diagnosed in 2020). 

I live with my mom right now (temporarily until school starts up again), and I try to act so different so she can’t see through me. Something to also mention, my mom has been working as a therapist for about 5-10 years. I’m not sure it’s been so long.. anyways I think she can tell though?? I’ve never told my mom of my diagnosis, I’ve only told my sister and brother. 

How do people just tell other people about their diagnosis? Or how do they even open up about this?

Today, I got into a mini argument with my sister (via text). Now she’s not talking to me, and I always blame myself. This is my fault right? My fault that I haven’t been going to see my psychiatrist, or that I stopped taking my medication. Maybe if I tired harder to do it, my dad, sister, and brother would start talking to me again. Maybe it’s just me wishing on a once in a lifetime thing.

My rant for today, I hate myself and I blame this disorder. Maybe… I try to think, I don’t have it. It’s hard to admit to myself also. I feel like it’s like a sickness, like the flu. It’ll go away, and nobody will know. . .  Anyone feel this way ?

,bipolar,"Hello everyone, 26(m), I am writing this post to seek support because yesterday I left my psychiatry appointment 15 minutes earlier than scheduled following a heated discussion about my concern with one of the notes she made on myChart.

For some context I was hospitalized for mania and diagnosed with bipolar/psychotic features in October 2021 due to the hallucinations and delusions I was experiencing at the time. I got released from the hospital while still manic and without any medication and my situation only got worse. I got in a fight in January 2022 while in psychoses(thankfully nobody was seriously hurt) and was arrested as a result. It was an extremely traumatizing event but thankfully as far as legal charges go I was found not guilty by reason of insanity in May of 2023.

I started treatment with my current psychiatrist/provider in February of 2022 because getting treatment was one of the conditions of my release from jail that was ordered by the court. I complied and quickly enrolled in treatment despite still being manic and paranoid in general. At the start of my treatment, my psychiatrist was immensely helpful. She put me on abilify which worked wonders and in just about 1 short month I was no longer experiencing any major manic symptoms. However, and I'm sure most of you all know how the story goes next, I felt a strong sense of embarrassment and shame about my manic episode and fell into a deep depression as result.

This is where one of my key issues with my psychiatrist began. Over the course of my treatment since February 2022, I've been on 8 different medications, and am currently on a total of 5. I experienced exponential weight gain after starting some of the medications she put me on which only further plummeted by self-esteem as I use to always be a person who was in ""good shape"". I feel strongly that I have been overmedicated and there are 2 medications I am on in particular that have had some significant side effects and that didn't seem to present any net positive benefit to the table. I've been expressing my concern about being overmedicated for the entirety of this year to no avail. My concerns have fallen on deaf ears and the usual response of my psychiatrist to me bringing up these concerns is to simply INCREASE the dosages of the various medications I am on, which has only exacerbated my weight gain and intensified my feelings of depression and anxiety.

Now that brings us to my appointment with my psychiatrist yesterday. I already felt prior to this meeting that there was a great deal of dissonance between us and I never feel any connection with what she says. I have many times left my appointments more stressed than when I got there because of something she said and I've vented to my mom plenty of times about how much she stresses me out. Before going to my appointment, I had read a note on myChart that said something to the affect ""Person's sleep schedule is inconsistent at his choosing and he has no motivation to change it."" I read this thinking to myself: ""I choose to be unable to sleep at night? I choose to be depressed and have racing thoughts?"". Bothered by the note, I decided I would ask my psychiatrist at the appoint what she meant by that. However, when I attempted to do so, instead of explaining what she meant, she accused me of being a nittpicker and started to loudly assert that she wasn't going to change the note(I never asked her to change the note btw). When I tried to ask a second time what she meant by that note, she very loudly said ""This appointment is going to end. Can we have this appointment? Or this appointment is going to end."" When she said a second time that the appointment was going to end I was so frustrated I stood up and said ""alright, see ya"" and I got up and left. 

The wrenching ordeal wasn't over quite yet though because about 40 minutes later I got a call from my psychiatrist and she began to insinuate that my ""attitude and antagonistic behavior"" was probably due to the recent increase in my wellbutrin(a medication which has helped me lots btw). I told her that's impossible because I never picked up the new dosage to begin with because my insurance didn't cover it, to which she said ""Well don't pick up the new one because it could cause more 'irritable mood'"". So in other words, she tried to attribute our disagreement to one of my medications. Apparently people with bipolar aren't allowed to disagree with someone without being suspected of being off their meds or on the wrong med. I've just absolutely had enough and do not feel comfortable seeing her at all. There are other providers/psychiatrists at the place I go to but I'm so afraid to ask about changing because I'm scared they'll say no. Not sure how to handle this situation. Has anyone else requested to change to a different psychiatrist before? If so, how did the staff/organization react to your request? Any advice and tips would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all and sorry for the book. I'm just in a very depressed mood right now and don't know where to turn. I feel so overwhelmed.

I have lived with roommates before but my mother says there were problems. I did have two relapses within three years. I also lived in an apartment alone but like five minutes away from my parents.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a big city called Madrid in Spain away from family. I am living in a shared apartment as part of an association that has others with mental illnesses. It is transitional from dependent to independent living. So far I have gone one year and nine months without a relapse ever since I started this great medication for me, Latuda. I have been learning a very difficult language called Bulgarian and taking classes. Now I can have conversations in Bulgarian!

I go out every day. Walks and studying in the park. The chess club about once or twice a month for social activity.

My mother is worried that I won't know how to handle the problems living with other roommates without supervision like from the association. But I did for three years already! But again she found problems with it.

I feel like I have to be perfect or something for my family to let me be independent. Also, two psychiatrist s told me that if I take my medication I can live a ""normal"" life. My mother is a psychologist. So she has experience with mental illnesses. But is she being too protective? If I can solve this motivation issue I could work continuously without breaks. I really made a huge effort last year and feel like it wasn't good enough. I wonder if anyone else has gone through something like this.

,schizophrenia,"Is it possible that the medication itself is causing some of the negative symptoms?

I started with 15mg Abilify three years ago, now I am on 5mg Abilify and my symptoms are:

\- weak memory

\- difficulty focusing, walking in the room a lot

\- poverty of speech. I noticed my thoughts are about schizophrenia only or blank, no thoughts. It was not this way before taking medication.

\- boredom most of the time- this was unimaginable to me before taking medication. I cannot do a thing because of boredom. I mean I manage to study about 3 hours a day, cook (sometimes my husband cooks) and take care of myself but other than that I am just bored.

&lt;p&gt;- weak memory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- difficulty focusing, walking in the room a lot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- poverty of speech. I noticed my thoughts are about schizophrenia only or blank, no thoughts. It was not this way before taking medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- boredom most of the time- this was unimaginable to me before taking medication. I cannot do a thing because of boredom. I mean I manage to study about 3 hours a day, cook (sometimes my husband cooks) and take care of myself but other than that I am just bored.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hi everyone, I’m new here. I was hospitalized since November 21st, 2023 until December 30th, 2023. 

I believed that I was hearing voices from Jesus and that he wanted me dead. When I was working retail, I began paying for customers groceries and acting strange. I stopped taking my medication and lied to everyone that I was still taking it. I stabbed myself with a knife. I almost killed my mom. 

In the hospital, I had ECT (electric compulsive treatment) which led me to forgetting what had happened when I was schizophrenic. We had a lot of group therapy sessions. It was extremely boring in the hospital and I hope I never have to go back again.

I’m actually still schizophrenic and still hear voices if I allowed myself to talk out loud. My mouth automatically moves on its own and words come out. My rectum also moves and has a voice of its own as well. Nowadays, I’m left extremely restless and can’t stop moving.

Leading up to this, I did marijuana, mushrooms, vaping, and certain drugs. I now know that I never wanna do marijuana again because I don’t want to trigger schizophrenia. I don’t wanna do drugs anymore either. 

Honestly, I just want to lead a normal life and get in a relationship with someone and be happy. I don’t want to do drugs anymore and I don’t want to have another schizophrenic episode. I don’t want to stress or endanger my parents. I don’t want to find out more about my schizophrenia by letting my mouth move on it’s own and talking in tongues.

,schizophrenia,"I like to study on my own, even if the output is small because of my negative symptoms (weak memory - especially long term, bad concentration especially after 2PM, difficulty retelling, etc.).

I thought hard what could be the thing I am not too bad at and it could be:

\- integrated maths (high school basic course)

\- HTML/CSS, basic Javascript

 \- B2 English (Upper Intermediate)

\- maybe ancient history but not sure

I enjoy learning about k-12 education. How it is different now than it used to be, how it is different in other countries, what are common mistakes in kids' mathematics, etc. 

I would need to revise the topics if I was to do something with it, but I am not bad at these.

What I definitely could not do is teaching in person because of poverty of speech (I only have it in real life, it seems) and getting weak when talking to the audience.

I could:

\- make a website with text courses in my native language with many exercises

\- contribute on Brainly

\- write a fiction/non fiction book

I don't work here (I live abroad) because this would most probably require me to know the language of the country plus additional supplemental language the minority speaks. Only corporate don't require estonian and russian.  I cannot live in my own country because my husband is a foreigner. I live abroad since 7 years now and consider myself unemployable.

&lt;p&gt;I thought hard what could be the thing I am not too bad at and it could be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- integrated maths (high school basic course)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- HTML/CSS, basic Javascript&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- B2 English (Upper Intermediate)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- maybe ancient history but not sure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy learning about k-12 education. How it is different now than it used to be, how it is different in other countries, what are common mistakes in kids&amp;#39; mathematics, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would need to revise the topics if I was to do something with it, but I am not bad at these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I definitely could not do is teaching in person because of poverty of speech (I only have it in real life, it seems) and getting weak when talking to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- make a website with text courses in my native language with many exercises&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- contribute on Brainly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- write a fiction/non fiction book&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t work here (I live abroad) because this would most probably require me to know the language of the country plus additional supplemental language the minority speaks. Only corporate don&amp;#39;t require estonian and russian.  I cannot live in my own country because my husband is a foreigner. I live abroad since 7 years now and consider myself unemployable.

,schizophrenia,"By: Steven Zilberg

—

All my life; I have walked in the footsteps of ‘take me as I am or leave me alone’.
Why?
Such a question requires an honest answer.
Are you patient?
Such an answer requires enough time for us to enjoy a cup of coffee together while enjoying the ocean breeze.

—

It is true,
People do change or at least we all were blessed with ability to adapt.
In most cases, it is possible.
In some cases, it is nearly impossible.

People like me; AA or NA doesn’t exist.
People like me; support groups are not ‘magical cures’.
People like me; no amount of prayers, holy books, or scripture verses can silence the voices.

Schizophrenia is a fucking beast.
It is a savage animal that claws, bites, and stalks its prey.
It doesn’t retreat nor does it take ‘breaks’.
It is a 24/7 adrenaline junkie that seeks to wear down, torture, and confuse its prey.

We aren’t ‘broken’ or ‘cracked’ screens that you can take to a mall shop to be fixed or replaced.
We aren’t ‘projects’ that you can ‘work on’ for extra credit.

—

I have seen,
I have experienced it.
My ex wife,
My adopted parents,
College buddies,
Past lovers and friends with benefits,
It didn’t matter what gender, skin color, or political beliefs they had;

In the past,
I flirted with both men and women,
In the past,
I ate pussy and sucked dick,
In the past,
I let girls and guys tie me up,
In the past,
I was stretched out by real dick and toys.
It didn’t matter how long we dated or how long we had been friends;

As soon as I became ‘not useful’,
As soon as the ‘fun’ ended,
As soon as they were ‘tired of me’,

I found myself alone in a room,
No one sitting across from me,
Both cups of coffee cold,
Behind me stood three ‘evils’.
Behind me three ‘beasts’ whispered in my ear;
‘Didn’t we tell you this would happen?’.

—

It didn’t matter if we both shared similar hobbies,
It didn’t matter how many things we had in common,
I was just a ‘play thing’.
I was just a ‘fling’.

No matter how hard I tried to change,
No matter how medicated I was,
No matter how many times I attended therapy,

It never was enough.
Alex, Josephine, Bella, Caleb, Tyrone, Michelle, India, and Lily,
Kim, Charlie, Oscar, Fatima, Zeynab, Mohammed, and Clifton.

It took only one psychotic break.
It took only one episode of following a zombie Abraham Lincoln in a grocery store for all of them to pack their shit and leave without a note or even a text.

—

When I say,
‘Just as I am’,
What do you think it means?
Take your time,
Have a sip of coffee,
Think before you speak;
“It means take me as I am”.

—

Brief smile.
Sun’s reflection upon the sea.
You are correct.
I am unable to change who I am;
I am unable to build a TARDIS,

No matter how hard I try,
No doctor or surgeon can remove ‘schizophrenia’ from my brain.

I might be troubled.
I might be crazy.
I might not be able to provide ‘everything’ someone wants;

What can I do?
I can provide laughter.
I can provide comfort.
I can provide unconditional love.

It is true,
I can’t provide ‘promises’ or ‘a boring life’.
If someone dares to stay instead of leaving in the middle of the night or early in the morning,

They will witness chaos.
They will witness ups and downs.
They will witness just how cruel ‘Charlie, Xavier, and Cassandra’ can be,
They will witness an imperfect lover who dares to give everything they have left to whoever is willing to stay,

—

In the beginning,
I asked if you had enough time to enjoy a cup of coffee,
It seems that you kept your promise,
In this case,
Would you like to walk along the beach as a sign of friendship?

I found this community so I could better understand my mom’s conditions and learn how to support her better. 

She’s been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. She is also an alcoholic and dabbles in mind-altering drugs and has been on and off in rehab (2 years but no longer) and has been increasingly experiencing audio &amp; visual hallucinations with an increased level of paranoia. 

I don’t live in the same town and it’s very difficult for me to provide support (outside of financial support for medicine) for her. 

She was recently prescribed Ambilify (15 mg) but is currently too scared to begin taking it. I’m also in the process of trying to better understand treatments. She’s at the point where she says if the voices and vibrations don’t get better… they will kill her. My other siblings are estranged/don’t want anything to do with her and she lacks significant support system. So I’m increasingly concerned about her life and really anxious.

,schizophrenia,"The energy due to meds I have are so low that I do not even want to socialize anymore and only want to lay down in bed. 

My first two hospitalizations were drug induced. My 3rd and last one were forced (no drugs) and I still don't agree I had a full psychosis like the drug induced ones but anyways... forced to take 15 and later 12.5mg olanzapine since July.

Yes, the positive symptoms are (not really low) but not relevant anymore and I'm thankfull therefore but the negative symptoms (low energy) are not bearable anymore. 

Not wanting to socialize, anxious about going to family and meeting with friends. If this is supposed to be the cure then I see really no serious normal future.

I texted my psych a whole text for the first time seriously about this issue and he didn't even respond to it. Not face not face and not on whats app.

About a couple days I'm going to offer a lowering of the dosage because this way of life isn't healthy. Yes, I exercise daily but with the last bit of energy I have. Without pre-workout its impossible.

&lt;p&gt;My first two hospitalizations were drug induced. My 3rd and last one were forced (no drugs) and I still don&amp;#39;t agree I had a full psychosis like the drug induced ones but anyways... forced to take 15 and later 12.5mg olanzapine since July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the positive symptoms are (not really low) but not relevant anymore and I&amp;#39;m thankfull therefore but the negative symptoms (low energy) are not bearable anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to socialize, anxious about going to family and meeting with friends. If this is supposed to be the cure then I see really no serious normal future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I texted my psych a whole text for the first time seriously about this issue and he didn&amp;#39;t even respond to it. Not face not face and not on whats app.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hello,

I’d like to share my experience regarding two supplements I’ve been taking for the current week that may have helped me in reaching this sort of calmness of mind (not totally but I’m planning to keep taking these supplements for more time) 

So as you can see the first pic is the stress levels which this week have been dropping because even tho I didn’t do much this week my routine was the same.

On the second pic you can the lower points in white, which indicates the fatigue points so to say the blue points are the peak energy of the day (you start with the blue point and the dot drops as you get tired in the day) so the lower white dots are the score in which I’ve ended the day (still tired but hoping to do better)

So now the “secret”, I’ve been taking Taurine 1g every 4h of the day for a total max dose of 3g in a day.

The second is Zinc Bisglycinate 50mg from a well known orange and white supplement brand.

Now from what I’ve read the Zinc balances both GABA and Glutamate maintaining homeostasis. Taurine on the other side can balance excessive glutamate levels as well and a double blind study also noted that can help with psychosis in general. 

I hope you can find this useful if your HRV data tells you you’re stressed or that you see for example bulging veins in your body for no apparent reason.

I think that there is some group of people who watch everyone and when they see potential, or someone suffering, they use technology to teach them and help them grow. And these are the silent voices I hear. More like I just know what’s being said than a voice. I feel like there is a group of people who put a lot of time and effort into helping people overcome their problems and the best way to help is to do it remotely. But they are always watching. And they talk to me.

 My voices are back and it used to go through every terrible moment of my life and talk about it so I wouldn’t implode. Every little secret I had. I feel I have been watched for a long time. All those secrets came back to me in ways I had not remembered. The detail was shocking, I only remember when I went through hallucinations like that. They literally hurt at the time.

Unfortunately, I believe I am special and loved. It is good when the voices are back and I can feel the peace and love of being helped and that someone knows just how fucken hard everything has been for me and can see how much I try and my self discipline. The recognition makes me very confident. I need to know I am being watched cause I work so hard. It was hard at first cause I hate myself so much that I can’t handle people knowing anything about me. Even to this day. But it goes away for months at a time and I forget all about how good I feel when someone appreciates me and my effort. 

I wish my internal world was real. I am convinced right now that it is and I am elated. But I know it will come back around to my empty self. Without the input of the voices, I really hate myself and I treat myself very badly. But I still try to do what’s best for others. I just don’t want it to go away again. It’s the only time I don’t hate myself.

Similar experiences? I have also had the regular psychotic experiences, people trying to kill me, everyone talking about me, people trying to poison me, but it always bounces back to some kind of helping lesson.

I am a daily cannabis user (32) diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 21. High amounts of cannabis (1g+ for my tolerence) antagonize visual / auditory hallucinations as well as increased audio processing (music) altered thinking and emotional landcape. I have used psychedelics in my late teen early 20's (mild amount) and again at age 30. Let's just say enough weed makes me feel like I'm tripping, if that means anything to anybody. I have metaphysical beliefs rooted in logic. I have been hospitalized multiple times since my diagnosis. -------SO------ I have no formal diagnosis of autism but my partner is on the spectrum but unfortunately undiagnosed due to circumstance. Her therapist of 7 years isn't qualified and her facility is more geared towards classical mental illnessess depression anxiety what have you. My ex-girlfriend was on the spectrum, I've known and been around many people throughout life who were and I've seen many videos online about undiagnosed autism in adults that my girlfriend (she is really into psychology) showed me. Whether or not I was on the autism spectrum never crossed my mind, but neither did my sexuality or my mental health until I was into my 20's it was just something I never considered and even now it seems like maybe there's no way, but when I had my last episode getting off my meds (vraylar 3mg) I would experience moments (particularlly cannabis enduced) and the only way I can describe this is being thrust into a mindstate of autism. Logical sequencial internal monologue with pauses and moving over to different topics temporarily to get al the puzzle pieces and then go back to the previous moment in my head and put them there. But it was a whole experience not just like regular thoughts in my head. And from the way I've heard people who have Autism think sometimes it truly made me believe that multiple times. Again, I experience delusional thinking when I'm episodic so I don't really know I just figured this was a good place to post about it and get opinons.

I recently was told the same again and i honestly dont know how i should feel about it.

,schizophrenia,"Hello all,

I'm a sociopath that was targeted by The Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3)'s threat assessment and management teams. I'm a recreational drug user for 4 years, in the past few months I began hearing voices. However, I was a mental health professional and took pride in my ability to help my clients who suffered from schizoaffective disorders. What I'm trying to say is, I know what's real and what's not.

After months of hearing voices, and research out of my field - I've deducted that I am being targeted by remote neural monitoring technology used by my local law enforcement agency. This technology simulates schizoaffective disorder. I've already ceased drug use and anti-social violent behavior, but they still insist that I take anti-psychotic medication.

The point of this post is to spread awareness on synthetic schizophrenia as well as disprove the myth that ""drug-induced psychosis"" exists. Why does drug-induced psychosis occur in so many young men across the country? Well the answer is that it's induced by law enforcement working with paid informants to prevent violence before it begins. Drug induced psychosis is a myth fabricated by our government to lobotomize potential risks of violence (young men with violent thoughts). 

My personal questions to the schizo-affected community is what side effects they experience on anti-psychotics and which ones they recommend. I do not want to lose my sex drive or my capacity to learn and retain information. If there is constant brain fog and I lose all sense of arousal, I would rather deal with the RNM technology.

 Cars that pass him are following him or are illuminati paid actors, birds following him are controlled by witches, strangers walking by are hitmen. Recording strangers walking by and having verbal altercations with some threating to fight them. some stuff about shapeshifters?? 

he has left comments on some of his shorts going into more detail, one i saw was deranged im not sure if he was actually fighting somebody. but this is it;

 ""The tall caunt is in that car, her brother shapeshifted into some British phag and tried to start shiatsu with me, next time I see him its ON. The tall caunt is there if theres a fight she will help him by attacking me from behind as a ghost and make me lose, like she did at the park with her brother and broke my knuckle by pushing me from behind and only my right hand broke not left when I was throwing hard punches with both hands. She did the same with my thumb on my right hand back in april, dislocated it by pushing me from behind as a ghost. The ""right"" theme that serves her also trying to force me because of her ego, lock me in a room with her and see what happens. These old geasers who supply the ID's so they can shapeshift and roam free in public. One day they will get their comeuppance.""

I try. Hide my pain away, saving it for a rainy day.  
To cry out in the cascade, since no one can differentiate.

The teardrops from the pouring, mourning over a past life.  
Better extradite the lingering thoughts of suicide.  
Asking myself, who am I ought to be?  
It's do or die, but static as a TV screen.

Without a signal. Mingling with Death.  
Confessions of unrest. As if life was the test.  
Then call me a cheater, since I've been...

Greeting people with a smile, but feeling like a poltergeist.  
Moving in silence, the clock strikes five past five in the morning.

But it feels like I am sleeping.

Nightmare. Fight fear with all my might 'til I'll be all right.  
Since after the rain comes sunshine.

My only dilemma at the moment is knowing if I should create the book just in print or if I should also offer a digital download of the book that can either be filled out on a tablet/phone or printed out. If I did a digital book it would be less expensive than the print book. I also plan on creating a program where people can &amp;quot;donate&amp;quot; a book and those experiencing a financial hardship can apply to receive a donated book. You can see more about the book on my website if it helps.

,schizophrenia,"EDIT

Apparently im banned from replying to the sub because i used the nono word in it.

But i'll be damned if i wrote it to the length I did and have it deleted, so I changed the word to Ignorant instead :)

HERE IS:

OK, so here it goes. I don't really know exactly how it all happened. But To get on the streets, I was living with my dad, after having just moved back to my home town from the Rocky Mountains. And his wife simply put, is ignorant. and would scream at me the way my mom does uncontrollably, and unnecessarily.... like ""Dude's got schizophrenia... I'm going to yell at him for taking my vitamin C pills... let's see how he reacts to that!!"". So then I went to stay at my mom's until I could get on my feet. Again. I had left some dishes in the sink, for no more than 3 hours, and I got back home to her drunkm on the couch, and talking to me as though everything was cool. I had no idea that when I went to go to bed, there was a pan, plate and fork in my bed, with a note that says ""I'm not your servant"". Schizophrenia seems to put a target on the person with it. People seem to enjoy seeing how you will react to gas lighting, and continue to call you crazy for it.  
  
It was that moment, I decided I wasn't going to take it any more. Even though it was -20(Celsius) in the winter time, I had to go. I couldn't handle staying at someone else's place and being subject to their random freak outs, and feeling like I owed it to them to take the abuse.  
  
I got checked in to a shelter. And got my ass in gear to get my job back at the tire retread plant, I had previously worked, and managed to do so. Gained employment 2 weeks into homelessness and got a job making $36/hour. I was set to only be homeless for a couple more weeks.  
  
Wrong.  
  
Even though, my life at this point was walking an hour and a half to work, and an hour and a half home, putting in 8 hours, and going to bed, I found myself getting my ass kicked, or bear maced, and lost my job very quickly.  
  
Shelters pay people to ensure your head is in the bed, and they get paid. especially if you are teasing them by only letting them host you for less than a month.  
  
Its scary and ridiculous.  
  
Anyways, as months went by, I was drinking more and more, and my mind would spiral. I really was, at times, the guy screaming in the middle of the road.  
  
One time I even threw my entire disability cheque in 20 dollar bills into the wind on the side of the road telling everyone to ""take it, you're all a bunch of fucks, anyways"" (1500$) in 20's gone. just like that. Before anyone is flabbergasted that disability is 1500$ here, ""why don't I find a place with that"" I live in a part of the world, where a 1 bedroom apartment is 1600 - 2600$/month nothing included.  
  
I got shot walking by a trap house on ""13th street"" believe it or not. Didn't even know I had gotten shot. I was on one of my rants, and i slipped on the ice. I landed on my back and thought ""Man... that really burns. I must have thrown something out in my back"" and went about my day. It wasn't until an unrelated X Ray revealed a .22 in my back 2 inches from my spine, I put it all together. Turns out, I slipped on the ice because someone shot my ass.  
  
I guess I scared a girl really badly while smoking meth with her in the grocery store parking lot. Because she pulled out a knife, and dragged it across my leg.. I looked her in the eye, while she was so stricken with disbelief at what she had done, and asked if she was ok before I realized the guy she was with also had a knife, and I should probably be more concerned about me being OK.  
  
Turns out, she was with the people that shot me. (I still have no idea why they shot me, I owed no money, I had hurt no one, but I would often ramble about some pretty crazy shit)  
  
A few months later, I went to the Trap house I had been shot by (at this point, I had no idea they had shot me) I was smoking a bowl in the living room when this guy named Smiley, of all things, says ""Is this him?"" while I was exhaling my hoot, He punched me in the face, but i started bleeding EVERYEWHERE. I tried to stay calm but the guy who was running the trap house told me to go before he stabbed me in the head again.  
  
So, then i realized I had, in fact, just been stabbed in the head, and I'm pretty sure, he was aiming for my eye. He missed. I now have a Harry Potter scar.  
  
I really had nowhere to go but the shelters, and the energy in those places is shit at best. and some don't do weapons checks.  
  
I once had to wander the streets and sleep in structures i made out of pallets in -20(Celsius) weather because the girl who cut me in the grocery store parking lot was staying at the shelter that didn't do weapons checks, and everyone sleeps in a gymnasium together with an L shaped wall around your bed so as to feign privacy.  
  
Anyways. I was losing everything every day. and everyone at that.  
  
Because I was homeless, and ""schizophrenic"" no one wanted anything to do with me.  
  
My father would almost daily, however, take me for coffee, and try to give me at least half an hour a day of some kind of link to the ""normal world"" but he couldn't do anything for me. all he could do was give me 20 bucks here, or 20 bucks there, to try to help me out, as I had been drinking a lot, and smoking a lot of stimulants (don't blame the guy... you have no idea how hard it is to see your son in this state, and say no to your child over $20 when you have a shitload of money). I wasn't going to make him choose his wife or me... anyways. besides the point. My father is a saint.  
  
I got so fed up with living the way I was, and the toxicity of where I was living. I asked my dad how much it would cost to drive me to the Rockies. (I was living in Kamloops, population 100 000, and where they dumped all the homeless people from Vancouver when the Olympics came.) The town I now live in, in the Rockies, has 5000 residents, and gain about 2000 more in the winter, as its a ski resort.  
  
He figured it'd cost $250 to get me to the Rockies. I had begged him to take me. He almost didn't as I had no game plan. I was just going to bring a tent, a lantern and a sleeping bag, and figure it out.  
  
  
  
He wasn't prepared to bring me here, if I didn't have a plan. He failed to realize, at this point, there are no plans. I'm sub human at this point. no one wants to even try to help me, no one wants me near them, my father has a hard time being around me,m its so upsetting to see. He was convinced I wasnt getting ym ass kicked, and I just missed work because I was drinking or something... I have no credibility. I'm schizophrenic... which also feeds into people not wanting to help me make a plan.  
  
I digress. I told him to fuck off, and I would hitch hike then.  
  
At which point, he let out a huge sigh, and said. ""I guess you leave me no choice then... we leave Friday""  
  
So, my old man and I went and bought a tent, lantern and sleeping bag, and drove 9 hours to the Rocky Mountains. to where I had ONE plan.  
  
I got dropped off at my old land lord's door, where I used to rent a room for $500. I knocked on the door (my dad had to take off before the door got answered in fear that my ""plan"" may not work, and he wouldn't be able to leave me knowing i would b camping in the mountains).  
  
So I knocked on the door, and my old land lord answers and says ""what are you doing here?""  
  
I said, ""Man, please tell me you have a room for rent...""  
  
He brought me in, and I told him my story for 45 minutes, and he said ""well, I'm renting to 3 other guys at the moment, but you can have my room. I'll sleep on the couch.""  
  
I now pay him $900 a month out of gratitude, I have since got a job at a local retail shop, There are no drugs to speak of here, and i manage to keep my drinking under control, even though, I still drink 3 or 4 times a week.  
  
I've put on 30 pounds, and life is great.  
  
I only hear negative voices if I drink too much, the rest are nice voices now, my visuals are those of beautiful naked girls (no joke) and I am finally feeling at one with the matrix.  
  
So yeah. It seems like there's no hope... but there is. Someone out there loves you. Until you find them, you got to keep going, and believe in yourself, and KNOW that the world is FAR more schizophrenic than you are.  
  
Schizophrenia is a label they put on strong people for the ""sane"" people to project their insanity.  
  
anyways, after writing such a long post, do i sign this or some shit?  
  
\-busy living the next story
