,Army,"Long time lurker here, figured I'd finally post.

Been a nasty girl since 2019 and it's been a complete waste of time. Am a 1LT and I don't know anything about the Army or my job (35A). The most they've ever tasked me with is figuring out the weather. The couple of times they've asked me to do more, I did a whole bunch of work, just to be told to disregard.Ive just taken up the unofficial job of going to bat for soldiers nobody wants to listen to.

I dropped a CAD packet and it got approved. Am now waiting to get scrolled. I spoke to a Captain who will receive my scroll and cut my orders. She advised she has duty stations in Korea, Hood, and Bliss.

From my time spent lurking, Hood sounds like a mess so if I get to choose, I'll avoid it. Bliss sounds better but not by a whole lot. Korea sounds like the way to go.

The sticking point is promotion boards. If I get in early 2024, I'll be just 4 months or so from O-3. She expressed some hesitation on sending me to Korea with my promotion so close. 

I can guess at why but I don't understand enough about this process to understand it. Why couldn't I just promote in Korea? Why would promoting stateside be an easier process?

She said she could delay my promotion by 18mo but given the pay difference that sounds like a major L.

,Army,"I'm summoning those of you who are *only* **currently active duty** or **retired**. 

This is about a topic of a veteran wanting to go back in, active duty and looking for your outtake.

The reason why I'm seeking opinions only from active duty or retired veterans is because there are too many biased opinions of us veterans when the topic is brought up about *going back into the military*. Yeah, I get it, going back in, is a stupid idea - to you? I get it, ok. But I already heard your reasons, let me hear it from the updated/current sources that knows what the fuck is going on, right now.

So. I'm a veteran. I wanna go back into the military, as an officer. I did four years in the military, enlisted,, infantry (3 combat tours), got out, went to school using my GI bill and got my degree. The main goal prior to me even getting out, was to go to school, get my degree and go back in as an officer. I started contracting overseas as soon as I got out and did my schooling online. Made bank. The whole money chase is over for me, I made great fucking money high six figures but it didn't bring me happiness. Job felt missionless/empty. Along the way, met many veterans talk about VA VA VA VA. Did my VA shit, slightly forgetting the idea of going back in and only claimed minimal stuff. I have 30% disability now with a possible option for a higher rating (if i claim more, I only claimed my knees). I've been out for some time now, about 5 years now going on 6. I'm fit and live an active life style. I am now in a job doing what I got a degree in. This idea of going back in has stuck with me and even working with the military now but the AF, I still can think of myself going back in. (Side note: I can't ask this question to the military I work with right now, AF, because these mf'ers are a different breed. Gauges, beards, get off early, don't police call - just a different fucking bread) and I get it. Times are different now. Whatever, merry christmas, doesn't phase me. I just can't ask this question because the AF lifestyle is fucking different and I'm not looking to join the AF. I already tried :). Fun fact, if you've been out for 5 years, you can't ever enlist. Second fun fact, going officer in the AF is a min 2 year wait. And they are fucking selective on who they choose. I'm not that god damn smart. I wasn't stellar in college, I did enough to get my fucking degree. And they base their selection on additional shit like voulenteer time and other side shit. Gotta pass. Anyway back to my story. The idea of going back in has stuck with me pretty much since getting out. I do like the military lifestyle, I like being on base, I like all aspects of the military. The purpose of my goal here, is because I want a retirement. I've met countless veterans while contracting overseas who were retired, getting their retirement checks, and VA, plus the check for work. I always envied that. I don't want to retire in the US. Thats my point. Sure, VA is nice if you get a high rating but when it comes time for me to retire. I don't wanna HAVE to work if I don't need to. Having 2 guaranteed paychecks, plus if I retire as a civ somewhere, so 3, and when I get to the age for social securtity, thats 4 checks, sure as hell sounds a lot better than just 1 (VA) or 2 (VA) and a (CIV) job and then later SS. Plus the VA never really has anything saying the VA the VA is forever or at least I dont know if it exists, I cant find it, and with the amount of veterans getting out on a daily basis and claiming VA, getting 100%, fuck I don't even know what the system is going to look like in the next 10 years. I would hate to be relying soley on that and then it ends up stopping or some shit. Thats scary. I'm okay with the current changes the military has shifted to. I've been out long enough,, and worked in enough enviorments that Im well adjusted. To be nice. I'm not a hard ass; knife hander, all that shit. But I am about the military - I like the lifestyle, fitness standards of having to PT every fucking day, I like the idea of moving around consistently, while having a job for stability. The hours and all that shit, late nights, duty, doesn't phase me. I'm over it - It's the military. And I get all that shit.

Clearly you see my mind is made up here already, I'm just looking for some non-biased kick back on my *idea here.*

I guess what I'm trying to really ask here is. How do you like the military right now? (And I know everyone's opinion is different or going to be different on this but from the current sources, whats going on now?). Are you regretting staying in right now - why, or did you regret retiring? What do you think about my idea here?

Basically I'm just thinking - and trying to realistically have an apporach or prepation about my plan/idea here of going back in. It's like if you have your boys and they tell you that chick is bad news, but you go through it anyway and later regret it, and wish you would have listened. Like I'm essentially just romanticizing about the idea of going back in, as an officer, to end up, maybe not enjoying being back in for whatever reason. Then regretting why I gave up all these other options that I could have, had.  


Let me hear it.",t2_gp02qzmsq,False,,0,False,Question for those currently Active Duty or Retired,[],r/army,False,7,,0,,,False,t3_18pb3wn,False,dark,0.62,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1703354264.0,text,7,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m summoning those of you who are &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;currently active duty&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;retired&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about a topic of a veteran wanting to go back in, active duty and looking for your outtake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I&amp;#39;m seeking opinions only from active duty or retired veterans is because there are too many biased opinions of us veterans when the topic is brought up about &lt;em&gt;going back into the military&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah, I get it, going back in, is a stupid idea - to you? I get it, ok. But I already heard your reasons, let me hear it from the updated/current sources that knows what the fuck is going on, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. I&amp;#39;m a veteran. I wanna go back into the military, as an officer. I did four years in the military, enlisted,, infantry (3 combat tours), got out, went to school using my GI bill and got my degree. The main goal prior to me even getting out, was to go to school, get my degree and go back in as an officer. I started contracting overseas as soon as I got out and did my schooling online. Made bank. The whole money chase is over for me, I made great fucking money high six figures but it didn&amp;#39;t bring me happiness. Job felt missionless/empty. Along the way, met many veterans talk about VA VA VA VA. Did my VA shit, slightly forgetting the idea of going back in and only claimed minimal stuff. I have 30% disability now with a possible option for a higher rating (if i claim more, I only claimed my knees). I&amp;#39;ve been out for some time now, about 5 years now going on 6. I&amp;#39;m fit and live an active life style. I am now in a job doing what I got a degree in. This idea of going back in has stuck with me and even working with the military now but the AF, I still can think of myself going back in. (Side note: I can&amp;#39;t ask this question to the military I work with right now, AF, because these mf&amp;#39;ers are a different breed. Gauges, beards, get off early, don&amp;#39;t police call - just a different fucking bread) and I get it. Times are different now. Whatever, merry christmas, doesn&amp;#39;t phase me. I just can&amp;#39;t ask this question because the AF lifestyle is fucking different and I&amp;#39;m not looking to join the AF. I already tried :). Fun fact, if you&amp;#39;ve been out for 5 years, you can&amp;#39;t ever enlist. Second fun fact, going officer in the AF is a min 2 year wait. And they are fucking selective on who they choose. I&amp;#39;m not that god damn smart. I wasn&amp;#39;t stellar in college, I did enough to get my fucking degree. And they base their selection on additional shit like voulenteer time and other side shit. Gotta pass. Anyway back to my story. The idea of going back in has stuck with me pretty much since getting out. I do like the military lifestyle, I like being on base, I like all aspects of the military. The purpose of my goal here, is because I want a retirement. I&amp;#39;ve met countless veterans while contracting overseas who were retired, getting their retirement checks, and VA, plus the check for work. I always envied that. I don&amp;#39;t want to retire in the US. Thats my point. Sure, VA is nice if you get a high rating but when it comes time for me to retire. I don&amp;#39;t wanna HAVE to work if I don&amp;#39;t need to. Having 2 guaranteed paychecks, plus if I retire as a civ somewhere, so 3, and when I get to the age for social securtity, thats 4 checks, sure as hell sounds a lot better than just 1 (VA) or 2 (VA) and a (CIV) job and then later SS. Plus the VA never really has anything saying the VA the VA is forever or at least I dont know if it exists, I cant find it, and with the amount of veterans getting out on a daily basis and claiming VA, getting 100%, fuck I don&amp;#39;t even know what the system is going to look like in the next 10 years. I would hate to be relying soley on that and then it ends up stopping or some shit. Thats scary. I&amp;#39;m okay with the current changes the military has shifted to.

The hours and all that shit, late nights, duty, doesn&amp;#39;t phase me. I&amp;#39;m over it - It&amp;#39;s the military. And I get all that shit.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"Good morning, Team.

Context:

I'm on holiday leave from basic. I caught up with my employer and was given favorable news. I'm in the running for a promotion upon returning from OCS.

I chose to drill out of a unit 3 1/2 hours away in N.C. anticipating I would relocate to that particular area for a career opportunity. I was thinking long-term/big picture.

After being made aware of the prospects, I thought it best to be pragmatic, and drill with a unit closer to my residence in W.V./current employer (whether I get promoted or not). I'm happy with my civilian circumstances.

Question(s):

1. Is it possible to switch units during/immediately after IET?

2. If so, what would be the procedure?

My recruiter recommended I speak with the Reserve liaison at basic assuming the drill sergeants grant my request for an appointment. I figure it wouldn't hurt to ask the group for feedback.

If it doesn't work, I'm more than willing to make the drive without complaint. It wouldn't be the end of the world, but I'd like to explore any possibility of drilling in my home state.

I chose MP as my branch.

Any thoughts would be appreciated. I hope all is well.

&lt;p&gt;They say they&amp;#39;re doing stuff like gift shopping or finals. But I finished my shopping and classes (though I have less classes) when I was across the country before coming. They act like they care a lot about me coming but it seems I just end up staring at my phone or playing videogames unless I&amp;#39;m asking them to do something. Which typically gets an &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m too busy&amp;quot; in return. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;m left to sit here and wonder if they&amp;#39;re wrong or if I&amp;#39;m just acting way too entitled? This seemed like the best community to ask. I only come back to this shitty city because I thought I has people here to make it worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

I looked up some hidden camera car keys and found an identical one on Amazon. The thing is I do not know if it was actually on and recording me, or he just has that and forgot to take it from the bathroom.

However, I am nervous, what if he was recording me? I’m afraid to confront him about it as I really don’t know how and he may just deny it anyway.

Joined the marine corps at 27(now 31) when at the moment of truth I disclosed  2 “seizures” that I had 2 years prior and never went to the doctors because of lack of medical coverage.

I have now since stopped and started being healthy again and working out and have been fine. I’ve had an EEG done and results came back normal so nothing neurological. 

I was told when going to medical at parris island that the marine corps is 5 years seizure free without medication can stay or join. 

My question is will the 2 syncope episodes I had and got checked out for disqualifying? Or will I be able to get a waiver. I would like to join a branch before I turn 35 to get that itch to serve taken care of.

Please don't come at me for this. Two people with differing opinions and neither of us are in the service. 

Someone served in the marine reserves for around 5 years, give or take. He never went to combat or anything like that, and has no psychological issues from his time in the service. He does from his childhood.

 He was married to a woman and was arrested for hitting her, and somehow honorably discharged. Now several years later he's in jail again for brutally beating his gf woman while under the influence. 

In your opinion, are these the kind of situations that veteran housing is intended for? When he gets out, he will be getting a funded new 1br home to live in.

The experiences and lessons learned here have completely changed my outlook on life and reversed negative mental habits I sustained as a kid (most of us here can relate).

Now, I'm finding myself having made it on the CRP, and it's creating friction in what I thought was an already decided decision to get out.

Didn't utilize my TA for three years? Now, I could take advantage of it with a second contract. Fatigued from the workload of being a communicator in a Victor unit? Now I have the opportunity to work at a reserve station in my home state. 

My long-term career plan is to run for public office, and that is unmovable and defined. Although there doesn't necessarily need to be a set timeframe on when I jump into this, I'm apprehensive putting myself into a position where I can't get involved in this realm for another four years.

Some highlights since release:

* We've established a working relationship with JBLM to get issues addressed sooner rather than later. Most recently an issue with mold and SUDDC (kind of resolved).

**H&amp;C &amp; Congress**

No I'm not running, but some time ago I reached out Jeff Jackson who is a freshman congressman for the state of North Carolina and today I had the pleasure of meeting with his military advisor to chat about Hots&amp;Cots. Nothing has been promised by them, but they are working to see what avenues are available for H&amp;C and we plan to touch base again in the New Year. I wish I had more, but of the dozen elected officials I reached out to he was the only one that got back to me.

The longer I’m out, the older I get, the more the war seems like some distant dream that never happened. Some memories are like they happened yesterday.

I find myself laying in bed at night unable to sleep wondering how the hell I got here. I think I struggle having an identity because going to combat was all I ever wanted to do growing up.

Now I’m 31 and feel like life is so meaningless. I have a wife and a dog, I have a great career, I’m in great shape and look young for my age. I really have no complaints other than everything in life feels so fake, like a giant charade.

Part of me feels like I left my soul in Afghanistan, now I’m a grown man going through the motions of life because I’m ‘supposed’ too. Its hard for me to find ‘purpose’ in anything I do. The only pain I feel is the memories of two dead friends killed in action from my platoon and the thought of my dog dying.

What really throws me off is thinking of how they were 19 &amp; 21 when they were killed, I was 19. We were so young, kids. Its hard to rationalize to myself I survived and my life will keep moving on while theirs was cut so short.

One of the hardest pills for me to swallow is how nobody really cares. I put the USMC and being a combat grunt on such a pedestal growing up. When I was finally in, I felt so much pride. I loved coming home on leave and seeing how proud of me my family was. Now, nobody even asks me about the war, even my family. As time moved on, so did they. I’m safe now and they don’t have to worry about losing a brother or son. I don’t ever talk about the Marines or the military to anyone in my life. I even signed up for the VFW, but in my town there are no combat vets and its hard for me to find common ground with Air Force techs or USCG vets.

My Bn took a ton of casualties over there, including me. Its painful to come to the realization that the average American doesn’t give a shit what we did. I’m not asking for VA disability, parades, etc. I just wish somebody would say ‘Oh man, I heard you fought in Sangin? What was it like over there?’ I’d love to sit down and tell somebody about the change of seasons, how cold it could get, how beautiful it could be too.
