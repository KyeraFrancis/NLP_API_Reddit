,Army,"Hi, I'm 32 and planning to enlist. The majority of MOSs I'm contemplating, such as 35g/f/l and 25b, all require a security clearance of some sort. In my younger years (21-24) I was a complete fuck up. No direction in life. Got involved with political protesting. Nothing explicitly anti-government in nature, mostly environmental. Got arrested on three occasions. Only one misdemeanor (evading detention) ever stuck, but one of my arrests included two felony charges that were eventually dropped. My social media history is a bunch of extreme edge posting. And of course I experimented with drugs, ranging from cocaine to LSD.

Obviously I know not to lie about or try to conceal any of this.

,Army,"Informational Post for you transitioning folks

For anyone unaware there exists a field in the civilian world called Biomedical Equipment Technician or BMET (there's also a MOS for it that offers some of the best training in the industry so reclassing for it to go reserves or guard is an option as well). You work in a hospital setting repairing and PMCSing medical equipment, everything from hospital bed to MRI machines. You do NOT need a degree to work in this field but having one does make you more marketable. That being said if you are looking to get into a technical field with little to no experience this is a good option.

Firstly there is the college portion. If you choose, you can use your skillbridge to pursue a 2 year degree or certificate as a BMET though the College of Biomedical Equipment Technology. It is completely remote and is done online. Furthermore they will work with hospitals in your area, (or area you plan to relocate to upon ETS) to find you OJT as well, but is not required to complete the course. The President of the college is an Army veteran himself and the school is very much set up to accommodate military service members. That being said, even if you don't purse it as a skillbridge the scheduling works where you could potentially (given you role/MOS) attend the college during your transition window without it being on skillbridge.[https://cbet.edu/programs/](https://cbet.edu/programs/)

Secondly, the company I will be working for, Trimedx, is an independent service provider and has contracts with hospitals all over the US. They also offer a skillbridge internship.

If you have any questions about the field, the college, Trimedx, or even other companies, please feel free to reach out and DM me any questions you might have.

&lt;p&gt;For anyone unaware there exists a field in the civilian world called Biomedical Equipment Technician or BMET (there&amp;#39;s also a MOS for it that offers some of the best training in the industry so reclassing for it to go reserves or guard is an option as well). You work in a hospital setting repairing and PMCSing medical equipment, everything from hospital bed to MRI machines. You do NOT need a degree to work in this field but having one does make you more marketable. That being said if you are looking to get into a technical field with little to no experience this is a good option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly there is the college portion. If you choose, you can use your skillbridge to pursue a 2 year degree or certificate as a BMET though the College of Biomedical Equipment Technology. It is completely remote and is done online. Furthermore they will work with hospitals in your area, (or area you plan to relocate to upon ETS) to find you OJT as well, but is not required to complete the course. The President of the college is an Army veteran himself and the school is very much set up to accommodate military service members. That being said, even if you don&amp;#39;t purse it as a skillbridge the scheduling works where you could potentially (given you role/MOS) attend the college during your transition window without it being on skillbridge.&lt;a href=""https://cbet.edu/programs/""&gt;https://cbet.edu/programs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"I need help and advice about a serious situation my brother is in. I will try to provide the least information because I am afraid for his safety. He enlisted a few years ago and now lives overseas. He married another soldier not a year ago. None of his relatives know much about this person nor have met them in person.

He's being a victim of narcissistic abuse and it has become physical against him. His life has already been in danger. I convinced him to talk to his superiors which he did, but I have strong suspicion this may have backfired in the way that his abuser may have convinced him to get back together and take the fall for any reports he made. I believe even his career may be in danger. 

He's normally very communicative which drastically changed after the last violent event against him by his partner. I also have strong reasons to believe his phone is being monitored by his partner. I know for a fact that there has been times in which his social media posts and even text message replies have been done by his partner and not him. I am certain that since the last violent event against him occurred, his communication with his family is being monitored.

He's a sweet, kind person and unfortunately, this might make him the perfect person to be the victim of this. I not only fear for him facing consequences that do not belong to him, but also for his life and safety.   


What should I do? Should I call someone (his superiors or FAP)  to tell them what I know? Would that do any good? How can I make sure he's safe and that he has a support system that would understand narcissistic abuse and work with men who go through it? I will appreciate any advice and knowledge.

,Army,"We met at the beginning of June, and have been talking every day since. He's in the US, and I'm in the UK. He's also a sergeant in the military, so he's busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven't phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I'm too anxious to, but he's said that he'd find the time and we could whenever I'm ready. But we've sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven't made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.

But I don't know whether that's going to be possible now.

Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn't feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he's 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn't respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he'd been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn't be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn't have a right to know as we weren't officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.

Everything was fine for a while.

But then he didn't respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he'd had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He's had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I'm aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven't heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He's just completely disappeared on me, and I'm absolutely terrified.

I don't have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I'd never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn't big on social media), so there's no way I can ""stalk"" him to somehow find their details either. I've tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there's nothing.

He's a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn't lie about any of this. I really don't want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.

&lt;p&gt;My gut instinct is go to OCS, serve X amount of years and then go into the law enforcement direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"I'll go first.

I'm a POG in Afghanistan. I've been in my first unit for only 3 months and I'm deployed. There's a specialist in my section that misses PT 50% of the time. We are working some crazy and stressful hours the first few weeks (spoiler alert, it lasted the entire deployment). Our crazy MQ chasing OIC (Spoiler, he got his MQ) has us doing PT at 0430 6 days a week even though we're working 12-13 hours per day and no other section is doing this. I've had enough so I decide to get more than 4 hours of sleep one night and I don't show up to PT. They ask me why I didn't show up and I simply said, I was exhausted so I decided to skip today.

I was active duty, ETS'd to the IRR for a short period, and joined a USAR unit in late 2021. My contract time on the DA3540 was for ""3 years.""

Fast-forward to now and I've filed a PAR and discussed the issue with my units retention NCO, but our RPAC office hasn't kept me updated on the process, and I had to push just for them to say they only partially had my paperwork and needed ""enlistment forms, like your original DD-4.""

,Army,"Currently AD 15Y getting medboarded for bilateral wrist issues ( Left wrist ECU subluxation and Right wrist TFCC tear) during the medboard process I was in a car accident and while bracing before impact, the energy transfered through my right hand to my wrist, shoulder blade and neck. My usability of my right wrist and hand has now worsened. PEBLO has ""OKed"" me for surgery on the left as it is my dominant hand and on the waitlist pending updated mri of my right wrist to see if further damage is present. 

My question is should hold off the surgery until I get out through the VA? I will eventually need surgery on both wrists. My mum used to work for the VA hospital and knows the horror stories of veterans waiting for care. I've heard improvements have been done through the news but I am sure going through this community would give me better insight.

Also, my plan is to get out medically from army and go back to school via Gi bill and get my 2nd bachelors in advertising. I was originally going to work on helicopters components in line with my MOS, but considering my wrist issues I feel it would be safer to return to my creative nature.

Potential options I am weighing:

° Get out no surgery, get care through VA eventually.
° Get surgery on left, get out, get care through VA eventually for right wrist.
° Get surgery on both wrists, get out with lower VA percentage or possibly found fit for duty.

Please let me know your experiences and advice.

I signed a 4 year contract so it ends in 2026. A few months in, I realized i made a mistake. The reserves is ass. But I kept trucking on. I’ve been struggling alot financially, and mentally. I was gonna wait until the end of the contract to go back active but i dont want to wait that long so I am about to start the process of a conditional release. I know it can take awhile but if anyone has experienced it, how long did yours take? Any advice you can give me? Also if you got a bonus, did you pay it back?

Some highlights since release:

* Over 2,000 downloads and 70 reports. 
* We've established a working relationship with JBLM to get issues addressed sooner rather than later. Most recently an issue with mold and SUDDC (kind of resolved).
* CSM over at Eustis chatted about an issue over there.

**H&amp;C &amp; Congress**

No I'm not running, but some time ago I reached out Jeff Jackson who is a freshman congressman for the state of North Carolina and today I had the pleasure of meeting with his military advisor to chat about Hots&amp;Cots. Nothing has been promised by them, but they are working to see what avenues are available for H&amp;C and we plan to touch base again in the New Year. I wish I had more, but of the dozen elected officials I reached out to he was the only one that got back to me.

The longer I’m out, the older I get, the more the war seems like some distant dream that never happened. Some memories are like they happened yesterday.

I find myself laying in bed at night unable to sleep wondering how the hell I got here. I think I struggle having an identity because going to combat was all I ever wanted to do growing up.

Now I’m 31 and feel like life is so meaningless. I have a wife and a dog, I have a great career, I’m in great shape and look young for my age. I really have no complaints other than everything in life feels so fake, like a giant charade.

Part of me feels like I left my soul in Afghanistan, now I’m a grown man going through the motions of life because I’m ‘supposed’ too. Its hard for me to find ‘purpose’ in anything I do. The only pain I feel is the memories of two dead friends killed in action from my platoon and the thought of my dog dying.

What really throws me off is thinking of how they were 19 &amp; 21 when they were killed, I was 19. We were so young, kids. Its hard to rationalize to myself I survived and my life will keep moving on while theirs was cut so short.

One of the hardest pills for me to swallow is how nobody really cares. I put the USMC and being a combat grunt on such a pedestal growing up. When I was finally in, I felt so much pride. I loved coming home on leave and seeing how proud of me my family was. Now, nobody even asks me about the war, even my family. As time moved on, so did they. I’m safe now and they don’t have to worry about losing a brother or son. I don’t ever talk about the Marines or the military to anyone in my life. I even signed up for the VFW, but in my town there are no combat vets and its hard for me to find common ground with Air Force techs or USCG vets.

My Bn took a ton of casualties over there, including me. Its painful to come to the realization that the average American doesn’t give a shit what we did. I’m not asking for VA disability, parades, etc. I just wish somebody would say ‘Oh man, I heard you fought in Sangin? What was it like over there?’ I’d love to sit down and tell somebody about the change of seasons, how cold it could get, how beautiful it could be too.

,USMC,"as a non western naval infantryman I've read about non infantry MOS dudes (mechanics, cooks, motor t) going ""out of the wire"" on patrols, manning .50s and basically being included in patrols, is this normal? at what level of management can you actually authorize this.

can a PL basically tell the cook, yeah, come along so you earn your (CAB? CAR?) don't remember which one it is, or did this only happen in Fob's where the Capt or Lt was in charge of everything and could call a shot like that.

what's stopping a LT basically leaving the base with all the cooks during a patrol?

I ask the question because in my country non infantry are not leaving on infantry missions unless they are part of the operations order where all the names are written of who goes and who doesn't.

follow up question, did the troops during OEF and OIF have to write reports every time they shot a bullet? like did the army keep tabs?

In this first interview with Derl Horn, we go over his early childhood, what led him to the Marines, boot camp at Marine Corp Recruiting Depot San Diego, boot camp stories, being the 'grandpa' of his boot camp platoon, and a married Marine moving to ITR, going to Camp Lejeune and Cuba, and then receiving orders to depart for Vietnam. He would be assigned to the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines (1/9) one of the Marine Corps' most legendary battalions with a history from Bougainville, Guam, and Iwo Jima to numerous operations in South Vietnam along the DMZ. In his time with 1/9, he would partake in numerous combat operations, including Operation Buffalo, where Bravo Company would have 57 Marines killed in one day on 2 July 1967.
