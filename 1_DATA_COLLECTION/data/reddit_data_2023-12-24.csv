,Army,"I’ve never posted on Reddit before, so I hope it’s ok I ask for some lenience. I’ve been with my boyfriend for two years, and I’ve never been more in love with a person. I am 19, he is 20, and I know I’m young and naive, but I can’t imagine a future without him. I’ve known since meeting him he’s wanted to join the army. It’s always been a hard subject to talk about, as I never supported it. I have strong negative opinions about the army (I’m trying to learn more, as I want to be more comfortable when he speaks about it) and he also knows this. For a long time we’d procrastinate and avoid talking about the army because I didn’t wanna hear it. 

About a year ago he dropped out of college because he just figured he couldn’t do it. He had a good job, and it wasn’t like he had no where to go. He has a loving family, a friend group, a good job, a girlfriend. But I know he’s always wanted to do this. I know it’s something bigger than me, and it wasn’t fair of me to try to convince him otherwise, to just be an EMT or a cop, anything but leaving me for the army. I couldn’t stand the thought. But he went to the recruiters and after a lot of back and forth papers on medical issues he finally was accepted. He only had ten days before leaving. And two days before he left, he told me he signed for six years instead of four, though he had previously told me four. It broke my heart. In BCT he sent me letters, telling me how much he loved me. I never responded, it was too painful. I’d write drafts but never send them. 

When he got to AIT he called, and we talked for hours, FaceTiming everyday in his personal time. It felt good. Having him home for the holidays feels intoxicating, I’ve missed him so much and every second I’m around him I feel high off of him. But I know he is leaving again soon. I don’t know how people do this, I don’t know where to start on opening up to knowing things about the army. I hate guns, I have strong opinions on them, but he has a strong interest in them and it makes me uncomfortable. 

Is it worth it to try to change my mindset for him and this relationship? I want it to be but I don’t want to lose my own morals. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this? How did you manage to stay together through the absence? Was it all worth it and after their time served is it easier?

,Army,"Greetings Reddit,

I am set to deploy for basic training on January 2nd, having chosen the 94R (Survivability and Equipment Repairer) MOS and entering as an E4. The reason I'm reaching out to Reddit is that I've been grappling with serious doubts about my decision to join the Army. To provide some context, I went through a mid-life crisis, left my hometown, and moved up north with my mother to pursue this path. In doing so, I left everything behind with no intention of returning. My impulsive nature led me to make this significant decision in a relatively short timeframe, deciding to enlist in September. Now, with about a week left before I ship out, I'm second-guessing my choice. It feels like I rushed into this commitment without fully considering the implications of the 4-5-year contract I'm about to sign.

My tendency to overthink things has me questioning whether I should have pursued Officer Candidate School (OCS) instead of enlisting to secure a more stable future. Despite these second thoughts, I feel pressured to join the Army due to the financial constraints and debt I'm currently facing. I regret not taking more time to research my military options before making such a life-changing decision. Unfortunately, that ship has sailed, and I must face the reality of my current situation.

I find myself at a crossroads, torn between my unsatisfying old life, despite having education, skills, and a strong work ethic, and the potential for a steady income and success with the Army. Fearful of making the wrong decision that will impact years of my life, I feel a sense of urgency to choose a path quickly.

For clarity, I have a 4-year-old son whose mother supports my decision to join the Army. We had a 50/50 agreement for our son's custody before I left, aiming to ensure his access to both parents despite our separation. The stark reality of the Army's distance from my son has recently hit me, leading to feelings of depression.

Despite feeling lost, I believe pursuing the Army is my only choice at this point to avoid drowning in debt. It's a disconcerting sensation, as it seems like I'm joining the military for reasons different from my initial expectations.

I'm open to answering any questions about my situation and would appreciate any feedback, whether positive or negative.",t2_q1gtn6qsq,False,,0,False,Seeking Guidance and Feedback on Military Decision and Concerns,[],r/army,False,7.0,,0,,,False,t3_18q3vf0,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1703451944.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

 I’d like to ask members of service a question. 

 I used to struggle with my mental health due to circumstances I couldn’t control. I was on antidepressants and an non narcotic anxiety (anxiety attack medication) up until august of last year. I didn’t use it for a long time. Just a few months. Will this affect my attempt at being enlisted. 

 Secondly, if it does, how do the waivers work? I’m completely stable now. Sound of mind. I haven’t needed nor sought medication since.

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to ask members of service a question. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to struggle with my mental health due to circumstances I couldn’t control. I was on antidepressants and an non narcotic anxiety (anxiety attack medication) up until august of last year. I didn’t use it for a long time. Just a few months. Will this affect my attempt at being enlisted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if it does, how do the waivers work? I’m completely stable now. Sound of mind. I haven’t needed nor sought medication since. &lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"I've been thinking about how the Army treats driving a lot recently. My specific base has \~60% of the soldiers in the unit living in barracks 30-45 minutes away from their place of duty. That leads to a lot of ride sharing, which has consistently led to soldiers having give rides in difficult circumstances. I'm all for ride sharing but it shouldn't be a requirement. I actually had to drive my NCO to work for a solid 6 months and never received any compensation, but moving on. 

There's a non-zero amount of soldiers here who can't legally drive because they don't have a US state driver's license required to apply for the host nation equivalent. Most people gloss over the word ""state"" when dealing with that, but that seems like a huge issue to me. It baffles me that soldiers are required to interface with the DMV/BMV from their home state just to certify that they are a competent driver.

A significant amount of people join the military for the express purpose of distancing themselves from their home, and that has an overlap with soldiers who, for whatever reason, don't have a license when they join or have a license that expires after they join. There are a lot of extrapolations to be made from this circumstance, but the biggest one in my mind is that soldiers who either can't or don't want to go back to their home state might not be able to maintain their driving privileges. 

Many DMV/BMV's have restrictions on how much they allow you to do remotely. Not to mention, they are generally extremely strict and may require multiple appointments to resolve an issue. This is a fundamental conflict with the military because a huge amount of soldiers don't reside is the same state as their DMV/BMV. In my unit's circumstance, they are stationed a $800-$1500 plane ticket away. Factoring in more considerations like leave, lodging, and transportation, It's a monumental task to undertake with no support from the military.

It seems to me that there is an extremely simple, albeit congress-level, solution to this. The creation of a DOD-wide ""Military driver's license"" would be an increase in quality of life for many soldiers. It could be a bona-fide ID card and simply certify that the holder is a trained and competent operator of motor vehicles. Testing could be performed in the same way they do motorcycle safety classes with a small classroom portion and then a practical test.

I know this issue isn't high visibility like mold or low pay, but I feel it's an important one nonetheless. In the meantime, I'll keep praying my engine doesn't seize up and my tires stay leakless.

,Army,"Hey everyone, recently I’ve been looking and wanting to join the Army as 35T but I’m stuck atm, here’s why.

Mid 2018 I was in highschool (minor) when a group of kids got in trouble, including myself. Long story short, I smoked marijuana for the first and only time. Few days later we all get caught. I had a cartridge battery in my bag (no residue of any sort as far as I can remember) when a police officer discovered it. They sent it to go get “it tested” I didn’t hear anything back from them. I received a misdemeanor for Drug paraphernalia that day. They called my parents to the school, explained the situation and we went home. I was never placed under arrest, never went/faced a judge/ nor did I get my finger prints taken. I did a diversion program that expunges your charge when you’re 18. I completed what was needed and got a letter in the mail when I turned 18 stating my charge has been “expunged” from my record (I know it can still be brought up) After highschool I started working for the Gov and was told I need a clearance. Filled out the SF86 form and listed my accident that happened. They asked questions and was given my clearance that same day. I want to see what the possibility is for me getting a TS/SCI that is required for 35T mos ? Do I have a shot at this ??

,USMC,"I’ll start of by saying in no way am I trying to attack prior service recruiters as a whole or to pass off blame, this situation was equally my fault as well.

This situation happened to me a earlier this year and to a couple of my coworkers as well (some were even in different branches). Now it’s currently happening to an old friend.

To explain from the beginning, I had just dropped out of the reserves after a mobilization so I could do a private security contract overseas. I was prior active, only went in the reserves to try it out and I luckily got mobilized to do OAW with the refugee crisis.

I knew my contract was about to be over within 8 months but I had intentions to re-enlist in the IRR for personal reasons. ATM it sounded more simpler, and I was able to do it while in a different country.

Long story short, due to complications, I couldn’t and just decided to move on. Until I was contacted by a prior service recruiter, asking if I wanted to re-up since I only had a month left on my contract.

He basically said he could temporarily drop me in a reserve unit and get an emergency extension and drop me out so I can re enlist in the IRR. Since retention is so bad, he said he does it all of the time.

I explained my situation entirely and how I can’t because I’m working in a different country and I won’t be able to check in the unit or make any drills for a year. He said not to worry, I wouldn’t have to make that months drill or the next because the unit was doing AIT in 29 palms and the next month was a blackout (no drill). He will do all of the work and have me in and out. 

I was skeptical but I was desperate. I did it, he said he would do all of the work. Even comforted me by saying this is all legal cause you definitely have to do this process in person.

Well after he dropped me in and 2 weeks go by with no word, I called him to check in. Basically said he was busy so he pushed me to some E-5 career planner that was fresh to the company, knew him when I was in that same company.

I called the company career planner and he had no idea about my situation so I had to explain everything. He said he’ll take care of my emergency extension and my drop out papers simultaneously so I would have to show up for drill. 

2 more weeks go by and I check in again, he basically said he pushed me to S-1 and gave me their office phone (which didn’t work). I saw what was going on and got pissed. I said fuck it and was just gonna wait until my contract was finished, I had other shit to worry about at the time.

3 months go by and I get a called from this aggressive SSGT accusing me of being UA for like 3-4 months and I explained my situation and he then start throwing more charges like falsifying paper work. Apparently if I didn’t show up immediately they would take away my earned benefits and drop my Honorable discharge. So I naturally freaked out.

I called the company 1 sgt and explained everything and he basically calmed me down, and told me he would set a meeting up with the CO/XO. 

During the meeting it was explained to me that my situation just sounded like a huge communication error and they would work with me. Basically they will just drop me out and forget everything, swept everything under the rug.

Not the type of person to blame everything on the Marine Corps but I really felt used in this situation, like just a body to fill someone’s quota. But I do admit I share complete responsibility in this as well.

You’re currently conducting rehearsals with your squad after getting a Warn-O for a company night raid on a heavily fortified compound. You remember the meth tablets and consider supplying them to your troops to further increase their combat effectiveness.

My grandfather served with the marines in the pacific in WW2.

He has a big box full of all kinds of medals and other things from his time serving, however, he NEVER spoke to anyone about anything having to do with the war; Just his brothers who also served and my mothers cousin who served in Vietnam.

Things like where he actually fought, any ships that he was maybe assigned to, what division or platoon he was a part of etc. and put it together for her so she can look at everything.

Joined the marine corps at 27(now 31) when at the moment of truth I disclosed  2 “seizures” that I had 2 years prior and never went to the doctors because of lack of medical coverage. I never made it past receiving and eventually got sent home. I had what my doctor called a syncope episode in late 2022 and one in early 2023 and he said it was due to being sunburnt, dehydrated, and drinking alcohol while on vacation. l wasn’t eating healthy then because I wasn’t doing well mentally and coping with unhealthy food and a good amount of alcohol. I have now since stopped and started being healthy again and working out and have been fine. I’ve had an EEG done and results came back normal so nothing neurological. 

I was told when going to medical at parris island that the marine corps is 5 years seizure free without medication can stay or join. 

My question is will the 2 syncope episodes I had and got checked out for disqualifying? Or will I be able to get a waiver. I would like to join a branch before I turn 35 to get that itch to serve taken care of.

Please don't come at me for this. Two people with differing opinions and neither of us are in the service. 

Someone served in the marine reserves for around 5 years, give or take. He never went to combat or anything like that, and has no psychological issues from his time in the service. He does from his childhood.

 He was married to a woman and was arrested for hitting her, and somehow honorably discharged. Now several years later he's in jail again for brutally beating his gf woman while under the influence. 

In your opinion, are these the kind of situations that veteran housing is intended for? When he gets out, he will be getting a funded new 1br home to live in.

&lt;p&gt;I never thought I would get to a point in my life where I was just content with my life, but it&amp;#39;s happening. I got married to my best friend in February and we bought some property and a house on a farm. We aren&amp;#39;t a perfect couple like any couple, but she centers me. She doesn&amp;#39;t pretend to understand what I go through, but comforts me in my depression and brings me back to reality when I&amp;#39;m manic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m making this post to maybe give some hope to someone out there who&amp;#39;s going thru it. I won&amp;#39;t say the cliché &amp;quot;it gets better&amp;quot;. I just know that with the right support system, anything is possible. &lt;/p&gt;

Well last night I had fed him some cheese and I tried to pet him and he bit me. My bad, I shouldn't have tried to pet him. But then tonight, I was setting his food down outside his crate where I have been putting it, and his blanket was spilling out of the create and was in the area where I have been setting the food, and I went to move it out of the way and he bit me pretty viciously. I don't need stitches or anything, but I was bleeding. Now I'm scared of him, and I think my husband is going to need to feed him and change his pee pads (he's confined to a room).

Hi, what advice do you wish you knew early on in your treatment/diagnosis of BD? I'm open to hearing anything. But given my circumstances, I'm especially interested in mitigating the pain that BD often inflicts on SO's, friends, family, etc. Any constructive advice/criticism is welcome.

### Backstory  
I'm a 30'sM with diagnosed&amp;medicated BD2. I'm only 3 months into diagnosis, still finding meds (Lithium+Depakote) that work for me, maintaining a high level of work/life/social/therapy/personal wellbeing, and am in the process of attempting reconcilliation with my (living apart) ex-fiance. I'm far from great, but considering the number of rock bottoms in my life, I'm doing well.

My symptoms started strongly expressing after both of my parents died days apart in 2020 (not COVID related). Up until then, I could communicate and perceive reality clearly. I'm a recovering addict who had a decade under his belt before rocketing towardsvtgis new flavor of hypomanic/mixed episode. While I was still my loving and goofy self, I started gaslighting my ex when she would understandably express concern. That turned into further detachment from trusting others, and both manipulating and controlling people and situations. I then took on my parents' estates w/o lawyers (didn't need to), and was fueled by a great deal of shame and trauma. This ""valid"" obsession allowed me to get away with a lot while grieving, and few others could see how different I had become. I was high functioining until I wasn't.

Around the time of closing each estate's probate case, I placed my hypomanic energy into a fear of abandonment that drove me to curate relationships, both platonic and one romantic for a childhood friend, to help me navigate my new unhinged version of reality. While I expressed love in countless healthy ways, I was also absent for my ex in ways that truly mattered as she navigated her own grief and traumas. I started fantasizing about ""ideal"" realities to help me cope with feeling unsafe in my own body.

Finally, after an array of triggers stacked a year ago - flu, rsv, covid, long covid, being alone, grief, and normal holiday anxiety - I allowed my other reality all the footing and outwardly expressed ""love"" to someone else on the phone. I thought that once she didn't reciprocate, then we could go back to friendship. She had become like a ""mom surrogate"" and we had been trauma bonded since childhood. To my surprise in that reality, no, friendship was not safe for her, and we stopped talking.

Months later, I told my ex the partial truth about the other woman, and denied the rest. Instead of saying I thought I loved her, I told her the closest truth I actually believed: I only had ""feelings"" for my friend. I didn't say the ""love"" had faded along with a hypomanic state. I didn't understand what BD, hypomania, mixed episode, or any of what I was experiencing actually was. Had I known then maybe something could have gone differently. All I knew for certain in my reality was: **they will all leave me if they know I don't understand myself anymore.**

After the facts of the emotional affair came out, my ex left me within the week. I became suicidal, obsessive, confused about my old therapist saying I definitely don't have bipolar, left that therapist, did a codepency retreat, joined 12 Step SLAA for love addiction, found a psychiatrist, got diagnosed ADHD, left psychiatrist as he was a dick, and **finally** found a psychiatrist + therapist that I can trust all of myself with, and was formally diagnosed and treated for BD2 😌  I would not be alive without my care team.

Now, my ex and I are in the process of a full disclosure to give her everything she needs to heal from the emotional affair, and hopefully process some of the pain of almost marrying someone who wasn't aware of their own BD (i.e. provide her moments in the relationship where BD took the wheel and gaslit, manipulated, or was cruel to her). There's no promise to reconcile, but it's the necessary first step.

It's been a very, very intense week as the holidays are primed to find all the cracks in my BD treatment plan, and introduce brand new triggers. lol thanks Santa 🎁. Even with a decade of therapy and success with some meds, I still find myself disappointing and hurting her even with the best of intentions + planning (e.g. communication blunders on both ends, oversharing, expecting too much too soon, etc.). I have a CSAT therapist for the emotional affair work, and one for BD2/ADHD. Meds and therapy are life saving and I'm improving. My shame is shifting towards more acceptance more often than not (well, except during trigger week... er, I mean ""the holidays"" 🫠).

But, I'm soberly aware that if I keep up at even this rate of healing, there will be no option for reconciliation. Even though it breaks my heart to imagine a lifetime without her, I can't blame her if the day-to-day of a BD2 SO would not be worth it for her (especially after my betrayal). Or, she just doesn't have that level of commitment to provide me/us given her own trauma history that she'll be unpacking for years to come. It's been promising to hear her talk about reading so much on bipolar, and asking questions and trying to make plans about what the relationship would look like given both of our needs. I pray there's hope for us but I see clearly how much I am asking of her to not only trust me again, but to trust that a relationship with a BD2 partner (even) in treatment could be safe and lead to a fulfilling life for her+me.

I have to make sure I don't unnecessarily hurt her or myself further because of manageable elements of BD2.

I was high functioining until I wasn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the time of closing each estate&amp;#39;s probate case, I placed my hypomanic energy into a fear of abandonment that drove me to curate relationships, both platonic and one romantic for a childhood friend, to help me navigate my new unhinged version of reality. While I expressed love in countless healthy ways, I was also absent for my ex in ways that truly mattered as she navigated her own grief and traumas. I started fantasizing about &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; realities to help me cope with feeling unsafe in my own body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after an array of triggers stacked a year ago - flu, rsv, covid, long covid, being alone, grief, and normal holiday anxiety - I allowed my other reality all the footing and outwardly expressed &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; to someone else on the phone. I thought that once she didn&amp;#39;t reciprocate, then we could go back to friendship. She had become like a &amp;quot;mom surrogate&amp;quot; and we had been trauma bonded since childhood. To my surprise in that reality, no, friendship was not safe for her, and we stopped talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later, I told my ex the partial truth about the other woman, and denied the rest. Instead of saying I thought I loved her, I told her the closest truth I actually believed: I only had &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot; for my friend. I didn&amp;#39;t say the &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; had faded along with a hypomanic state. I didn&amp;#39;t understand what BD, hypomania, mixed episode, or any of what I was experiencing actually was. Had I known then maybe something could have gone differently. All I knew for certain in my reality was: &lt;strong&gt;they will all leave me if they know I don&amp;#39;t understand myself anymore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the facts of the emotional affair came out, my ex left me within the week. I became suicidal, obsessive, confused about my old therapist saying I definitely don&amp;#39;t have bipolar, left that therapist, did a codepency retreat, joined 12 Step SLAA for love addiction, found a psychiatrist, got diagnosed ADHD, left psychiatrist as he was a dick, and &lt;strong&gt;finally&lt;/strong&gt; found a psychiatrist + therapist that I can trust all of myself with, and was formally diagnosed and treated for BD2 😌  I would not be alive without my care team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, my ex and I are in the process of a full disclosure to give her everything she needs to heal from the emotional affair, and hopefully process some of the pain of almost marrying someone who wasn&amp;#39;t aware of their own BD (i.e. provide her moments in the relationship where BD took the wheel and gaslit, manipulated, or was cruel to her). There&amp;#39;s no promise to reconcile, but it&amp;#39;s the necessary first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a very, very intense week as the holidays are primed to find all the cracks in my BD treatment plan, and introduce brand new triggers. lol thanks Santa 🎁. Even with a decade of therapy and success with some meds, I still find myself disappointing and hurting her even with the best of intentions + planning (e.g. communication blunders on both ends, oversharing, expecting too much too soon, etc.). I have a CSAT therapist for the emotional affair work, and one for BD2/ADHD. Meds and therapy are life saving and I&amp;#39;m improving. My shame is shifting towards more acceptance more often than not (well, except during trigger week... er, I mean &amp;quot;the holidays&amp;quot; 🫠).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I&amp;#39;m soberly aware that if I keep up at even this rate of healing, there will be no option for reconciliation. Even though it breaks my heart to imagine a lifetime without her, I can&amp;#39;t blame her if the day-to-day of a BD2 SO would not be worth it for her (especially after my betrayal). Or, she just doesn&amp;#39;t have that level of commitment to provide me/us given her own trauma history that she&amp;#39;ll be unpacking for years to come. It&amp;#39;s been promising to hear her talk about reading so much on bipolar, and asking questions and trying to make plans about what the relationship would look like given both of our needs. I pray there&amp;#39;s hope for us but I see clearly how much I am asking of her to not only trust me again, but to trust that a relationship with a BD2 partner (even) in treatment could be safe and lead to a fulfilling life for her+me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to make sure I don&amp;#39;t unnecessarily hurt her or myself further because of manageable elements of BD2. Thanks for sharing your insights.&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"Hey there I browse this subreddit often so I thought I would share some of my story. I live in Canada so Im very fortunate 

I'm currently stable, and well, not anxious depressed or manic. Also happy with my meds. Plus im feeling creative.

I've been manic more than six times. (lost track). I've been depressed for over a waking year of my life. Bedridden for most of it! I've struggled with suicidality for a year of my waking life. 

I just took Vancouver coastal health's peer support course and I got 97%! I start my practicum here in town shortly

I have been incredibly fortunate with what has been given to me. But I have also been smart and strong with my decision making and where I've been spending my time

Things that have helped me: 
Self advocacy with my psychiatrist
Spending time speaking with social workers
Quitting nicotine and alcohol
A rigid sleep schedule
Weightlifting
Meditating for at least 15 minutes per day
Calling support lines often
Keeping my space clean
Eating healthy (high protein, low sugar, fruit and veggies)
Socializing often (support lines help with that)
Taking my meds --1200mg lithium, 200mg lamotrigine, 10mg prozac, 15mg loxipine, 7.5mg zoplicone--
Walking daily
Diligent personal hygiene
*Honestly prozac saved my life* *everybody's brain is different ! Listen to your psychiatrist!*

Every time I get stressed out or tired or busy or emotional or horny or feel anything basically, I get sad because it’s number now. I used to feel things so deeply! I wrote loads of weird stuff about it! I felt a deep kinship with Byron and Shelley and Coleridge and all the other genius writers “touched with fire”.. 

But now sure I write. 100k people have read what I write (this is not a delusion of grandeur! This is true!). But it’s not really the same. Used to be able to write as easily and automatically as breathing and now I have to think about it. I don’t like thinking about it. Even at school I never bothered planning anything with my essays, I just wrote, and I got full marks. I see people saying that meds stifling creativity is a myth, but I’m not so sure. I’m on lamotrigine and I’ve seen a Lot of chat here about word recall. I also can’t think of rhymes as easily! Half my sentences used to rhyme! I’d make amazing connections in seconds without thinking.. almost like automatic writing. 

And then there’s the other side effects. Weight gain (I was told it’d not have been an issue if I had more willpower), bad dreams (nightmares every night! I wake up crying in fear!). It is so boring wasting so much time sleeping. I used to have most of every night stretching out in front of me, so much time. So much power, being awake when other people are asleep. Getting about 5 hours of sleep at the moment so nowhere near dangerland. 

My meds don’t really stop me having episodes, either. Feels fairly pointless. Chemists always fucks it up and I have to waste half my life hunting down a basic fucking medication. And there is so much else to do! 

I miss feeling like a god. Sometimes I do feel it still. When I’m outside on a windy day and the wind makes the grass look like the sea. When I climb a mountain. When I sprint down the lane after a 10k run. When I know what someone will say before they say it, when I do well in my Russian practice, when I learn a fascinating new fact of Old English.. sometimes at gigs too. But not as often.

I’m 20M w Bipolar 2, GAD, ADHD. I take lithium and I have been pretty stable for about a year now since my last manic episode.

So there’s a lot of positive things happening in my life right now

I just finished a whole semester of college for the first time in 2 years which feels amazing. My relationships have been going well and I feel pretty great generally with the holidays coming.

However I have started to notice some pretty major red flags concerning my mood. I have had trouble falling asleep, have been more talkative, more fixated/stimulated about stuff, etc. 

One of the things I did a lot when I was with mania and therefore is a warning sign is that I would change the things around me a lot (the arrangement of my furniture/decorations, the lighting, etc). In the last few days I have being trying to resist the urge to do these kind of things. 

So I’m pretty worried about going back into mania. After my last episode I took it upon myself to learn about this illness and so im pretty informed. Ill definitely be taking my meds religiously as well as and maintining a good sleep hygiene and all the basic stuff.

However I’m wondering if any of you have any experience seeing an episode coming and trying to prevent it.

,bipolar,"i know this is a very touchy topic! but i've always wondered how bad psychosis really gets and what the hospitalisation was for.

i've had marijuana induced psychosis twice but once it left my system, i was no longer in that state of mind (although i did take my time to recover)

but i imagine it gets bad for those prone to psychosis where it lasts several days to weeks. so is hospitalisation to stop you from hurting yourself or others? were you pumped full of drugs and put in a psych ward? how did they know to release you?

,bipolar,"So, for years, like 4 or 5 years straight, I refused medication and drank like the worst alcoholic I’ve ever heard of (literally a handle or more a day). I cycled so rapidly and eventually got into a deep psychotic episode. I’m finally on meds for about two years now and six months sober of everything.

Problem is I destroyed my memory of things I did! But apparently not permanently because things are starting to come back and I’m drowning in the shame and guilt that’s coming up.

I degraded myself so many times. For instance: I did porn for one of those live streaming websites (before OF was a thing) and bragged about it at my high school reunion. Had a threesome with my partner and kept contact with the third even though my partner said I had to stop and if I kept going it would be cheating. I stayed even though they were humiliating me and abusing me and I didnt want it. I signed up on sugar daddy websites and tried to be a sugar baby. That meant so many gross phone calls saying disgusting things and so many times I did this in front of my partner. Humiliated myself and my partner in front of their friends by asking about their sex lives the first time I met them and constantly keeping the conversation about sex. And so much more that keeps flooding into my mind. And I wasn’t even horny during any of it. All I remember is that I wanted attention, something to make me feel better and to know that I was wanted. 

My poor partner was there for me through everything even though I treated them like dirt. They’ve finally snapped and lost their love for me and probably is leaving me. I wish I could’ve taken my meds sooner and gotten sober sooner. I finally tried naltrexone and it’s the only thing keeping me from drinking. It’s like a miracle - I have zero cravings. They went away almost the same day I started that med.

I’m trying to forgive myself or at least be more understanding. I was traumatized with medications being forced into my mouth constantly (stuff I never needed) when I was a kid, so I couldn’t get over that in time before I imploded. I grew up with alcoholics that kept making me drink ever since I was a kid, too. I’m trying to tell myself that of course it’s ok I struggled before I got to this point.

But I can’t!! I can’t stand it!! I’m such a horrible person for what I did to my love, my person, my partner!! The list goes on and on and on and I can’t believe they stayed this long. I don’t blame them for needing to leave me, but I’m absolutely devastated.

,bipolar,"First, i'd like to wish you all a merry christmas and hope that you have a good time.

Five months ago, i [made this posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/14xw2y9/when_you_are_confronted_with_serious_problems_but/) here in this sub, i'd like to give you an update and i think, Christmas is a very good time to share this.

For those who don't have time to see the link, it was about the problems i faced, my parents were injured in a car crash, my dog was injured, my brother has cancer and i struggled with bipolar.

I'll tell you how it turned out: My parents survived, they still got some problems, but the doc expect a full recovery. They made it, got through with emergency surgery and then the entire process of rehab. It looks better for my brother about cancer, his body responds well to the treatment. There are more, rather small details, like i was able to avoid a relapse with drugs. My dog is also healthy again.

Today, we'll have a christmas dinner together at my family home and no seat will be empty, no one was lost. It was a hard time for all of us. It was at some points critical about life and death.

I'd like to thank the community here in the sub and also i was happy that some of you reached out to me with writing me DM's when i was in that long and dark night. It was the support i needed to keep going on.

Don't lose hope when you get confronted with such serious problems, where you don't know what is coming. Don't give up, even when the odds are stacked against you. In the end, you can still win and live to see better times.

Thanks for your support again, i'm really looking forward to our dinner and that we are all still alive, it's like a happy ending, even when it is just temporary. The good times are where you need to recover and gain new strength, so i will cherish every minute of this. 

P.S.  
They'll never get to read this i guess, but there were good people in the aftermath of the car crash, other cars stopped and civilians gave first aid to my parents, called the emergency services.

The summer at least for 2 months gave us some respite but first week of August had to send daughter to urgent care for vomiting. Again, fortunately, a one time thing.

Within a month and a half, we are treating once with one antibiotic for 10 days which seems to resolve until she starts coughing again with fevers! Luckily, negative results for all viral tests. But the cough stays and then we get call from her pediatrician and we start on augmentin. Cough is gone!

In the clear? Not yet because once she’s done she develops hives of unknown origin. It doesn’t help that the doctor says it could have been a whole number of things. So now she’s on Benadryl for at most 5 days and see if there’s improvement. 

Plus, we live by a creek that on occasion has reached threatening flood levels. In fact, we are dealing with PTSD from basement flooding 2020 and 2021, the last one life threatening for my husband. His anxiety is so bad when it comes to storms, I feel I absorb it too.

19M 

I'm a transplant recipient and in april 2023 i went into hospital for organ rejection, the treatment for this is multiple steroids at a very very high dose example being 500mg of prednisone, the end result of this and at the time having no medication for bipolar i went into psychosis, i was in hospital from april to i think june or july? i remember none of this and only remember beginning of April and August (a bit of July)

July is when i finally got home from hospital and my Cat died.. so i was dealing with that aswell 


In between this i said some really shit things to my Mom, my little sister, my older brother and my friends.. all of which i don't remember and i only have texts of what i said (i have absolutely no idea of what else beyond this) 

The aftermath of my behavior? well... I'm not allowed to live with my Mom and Little sister, they aren't supporting me in anyway anymore and have told me we can't go back to the way things were because of what i did.. the information i was given of my behavior was this: I'm manipulative, i don't act like family, i guilt trip, i said i don't see my Mom as my mom or friend, i implied my mom doesn't do enough for me, i implied she's not good enough.

What sucks is i do not remember ANYTHING which is scary... i pride myself on being the best person i can be.. i have so much love to give i appreciate everything the people in my life have done for me i try to be understanding and listen to people and i take criticism well.. so it confuses me how i can act so differently and i don't even remember...

since all this happened I've done multiple things to make sure I'm a good person who is still worthy of my mothers love... I've been going to the gym, i stopped drinking completely, I've been going to therapy which is completely draining my wallet without coverage but whatever, I'm working more towards my goals.. I've been controlling myself so much better since being bipolar meds.

because of this i decided to have a conversation with my mother again... it was going well until i completely broke down and started crying and essentially begged for them to take me back... i attempted to explain the psychosis and i expressed how i was scared and the end result of me doing this was her saying i was guilt tripping her... even though to me atleast all i was doing was expressing how I've been feeling.. i didn't blame her for anything i never even brought her into it.. all i did was say the things i was feeling since she said i couldn't live with them anymore it's not like my intention was to manipulate or guilt trip i just needed my mom...

i expressed that i thought if i started improving myself everything would go back to normal and i was told that's not how family works and things will never go back to how they once were...

My living situation atm is a risk to my physical health, I'm likely going to need another transplant in a few years or sooner but i can't get one because i lack support now, I have an older brother but he lives in the states (I'm in Canada) so living with him isn't an option.. i am lost and scared and I'm trying my absolute hardest...

I put my trust in a select few to help me manage my condition.  A few days ago I was quite happy and anxiety seemed like a distant stranger.  I was putting on a show for my baby girl, singing &amp; dancing in the morning.  Then my husband looked at me strangely.  “Do… do I need to take today off of work?”  I was surprised.  Why would he ask me that?  He pointed out that I was unusually excited, talking fast, etc.  But I was just in a good mood, right? He asked me to check in with my therapist; perhaps he was mistaken.  

Later that day, my therapist confirmed that I was talking faster than usual.  “How’ve you been sleeping?” She asked.  Uh oh..  not very much sleep.  But that’s normal with a baby, right?  Except baby had been sleeping through the night &amp; I… had not.  

So I agreed to take the steps to address the hypo-mania.  I took my emergency, fast-acting anti-psychotic; cancelled a play date I had planned &amp; went to bed early that night.   I got 12 hrs of sleep.  Groggy, I emerged the next day after a hard reset.  Sure I don’t feel quite as sing-songy or ready to run a marathon.  But I feel good.  I listened to the people I trust and I took care of myself.  

 Even if the highs feel really good.  Even if they don’t exactly feel like highs, I know where they can lead.  I have responsibilities, a child to care for.  I’m thankful for my husband &amp; my therapist.  And I’m proud of myself. 

TL/ DR: I trusted my husband &amp; therapist when they identified I might be hypomanic &amp; took corrective action to manage my Bipolar.

,schizophrenia,"Just want to drop some lines for today is Christmas.

So many of you now sit in a dark place and feel all lost and cast out. Others have a good time today, and we all sit there with the madness or the memories of. It can feel a lot like being discarded and rejected for the pains one has to bear. Like being punished twice for something that wasn't one's fault to begin with.

Well, I just want to tell you all today, don't give yourself up because of that. Don't let people belittle or disregard you because of the experiences you had. These experiences are all valid experiences. They are tough hardship, and even when other people can't see it we all struggle with this hidden suffering and have to get by.

We are all valid survivors of that hardship. We can be proud of getting through that and still being alive. People just have a hard time to recognize - if we were paralyzed, had lost a limb or sight or hearing, then people could recognize our hardship. The hardship we have in the mind they can't see. Some people fail to understand our situations completely, or just fear it too much, others follow an instinct to account the suffering to our persons, and this can really hurt and make one feel alone and lost with the suffering at times.

That's why we have to make up our hearts and realize and accept that this suffering is not visible but still there and valid. This is why people with experience need to stick together and raise awareness. Overcoming barriers of silence and working for the recognition of our pains. Many people already recognize, and understand that we are valid in our struggles. The experiences we have to make...they are the most humbling you can have, the most agonizing, also hard to see from the outside. And this is what makes us especially valid, because nothing makes you tougher and wiser in the end than what we have to go through.

So I want you to take this now into tonight, and try to make it a good night somehow even when others can't see that validity. You know in your heart you're valid and what you've gone through, you know you deserve all respect for that hardship. When others can't see it right, then you have to admit that to yourself.

Even when you're in a dark place, I hope you will not lose trust in life and keep working your way ahead. You know, you don't need to be the uberman to do that. You just need to be open minded and on the look for the chances you have in your life, and then step by step by step making these things real. And it's all there, this world may seem dark at times but the beginnings for trying to make it better are everywhere around us. We just have to look into our heart, around us, and listen to those who bring us the awareness of what we can do to make the best out of our lives still in our bad situation.

You know, there are often things in the way to that. The worst enemy to getting better I found is the thought of expectations that others and the world seems to have from people like us like from everyone. These expectations together with the silence about our pains are what can make us feel so dark at times, with the feeling we could never meet the standards we have to think of. Try to think differently today - we are not in this world, to live up to anyone's expectations, neither the others are there to live up to ours.

We are not really obliged to anything by our heart other than trying to get happy and lucky however we can. Noble is then, when you not only seek your own happiness, but also that of others and take the responsibility for it. This is probably everything our nature truly obliges us to, that's the freedom to follow our heart and learn from wherever it takes us. This is the point, when you realize after dropping some of the expectations you feel pressing you down, that you still can do a lot and follow your dreams and the good things from the present and past you find in your heart. It's all there for us, and whatever we do out of it will be a valid experience, no matter what other people say about it, no matter how many voices are dragging us down. The heart can and will still spark up these dreams for us to take up and follow, and I found, when we take our time and really follow them from heart, they can be stronger than the delusions, they can make us overcome them and reconnect to other people and still find fulfillment in our lives even when we thought all our previous dreams were broken down to shards. This is not just some empty words, but my own experience from more than 20 years with the diagnosis.

So, I hope these words can take some load of someone's chest tonight, and make you feel a little better about the situation. I know this situation can be very bad, but you're not alone with it, and when you just keep going and looking for new beginning you can maybe also find some threads to pick up and weave a new life out of it. It's Christmas today, so do something good for yourself and if you can and dare, also for another one, to bring back some hopes for a new beginning in the next year.

So I wish you all a merry Christmas, or a merry non-Christmas if you chose to reject the santa merchandise...hell, it's your right to do so, to celebrate or not, and it's still special days that you can use to give yourself some space for your heart. Hope you have people around you who make you feel valid, and if you're alone, I wrote this to tell you you're valid nonetheless!",t2_e4d8zb9y,False,,0,False,Schizophrenia is a valid experience,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18pvdtf,False,light,0.91,#0dd3bb,public,18,0,{},,cc4fb44c-b658-11eb-8a8b-0e5d4c19d3b3,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice / Encouragement,False,18,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,,True,,1703425035.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just want to drop some lines for today is Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll try keep this short. I have a younger brother who has just come out of a PICU ward and onto a transition ward.

He was expressing symptoms of severe psychosis and mania.

While psychotic he said he was getting thoughts about killing my mum and family.

He's now been medicated and has got day leave from the hospital.

His behaviour is still unnerving towards me, sometimes he'll be speaking coherently and then all of a sudden he'll blank stare at me really intensely.

When this happens I don't know how to react as it feels very uncomfortable. Is this typical behaviour for someone who has just been put on anti psychotics? He was doing this but more intense when he wasn't on medication.

,schizophrenia,"I’m not sure how to write this, feels very personal and also kind of hard to describe, but here goes…

 I am non-binary and diagnosed schizophrenic. I feel very certain that I am non-binary, but I just can’t seem to come out to people and insist on my identity. The reasons follow:

 I often feel like I don’t exist. Both in terms of not “representing myself”(?), but also like I *really* am invisible or dead already or just not here or between worlds/dimensions. I often feel misunderstood or paranoid. I sometimes get this weird feeling in my body, like I am thirsty, need a hug, my back itches and like I am violated, all at the same time. I’m not sure exactly how dysphoria feels for others, but I am sure, I have experienced it somehow. I change style and hair so often, that people can’t recognize me, which makes me feel even more invisible (also in a literal sense). I feel empty on the inside, like there’s a total dark, quiet room inside of me - which made me think there’s no way I can identify with a certain binary gender (I identify as agender). But also my schizophrenia results in me dissolving everything into nothing and everything at the same time, if that makes sense? So I’m just confused. And maybe none of this even makes sense.

&lt;p&gt;I am non-binary and diagnosed schizophrenic. I feel very certain that I am non-binary, but I just can’t seem to come out to people and insist on my identity. The reasons follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often feel like I don’t exist. Both in terms of not “representing myself”(?), but also like I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; am invisible or dead already or just not here or between worlds/dimensions. I often feel misunderstood or paranoid. I sometimes get this weird feeling in my body, like I am thirsty, need a hug, my back itches and like I am violated, all at the same time. I’m not sure exactly how dysphoria feels for others, but I am sure, I have experienced it somehow. I change style and hair so often, that people can’t recognize me, which makes me feel even more invisible (also in a literal sense). I feel empty on the inside, like there’s a total dark, quiet room inside of me - which made me think there’s no way I can identify with a certain binary gender (I identify as agender). But also my schizophrenia results in me dissolving everything into nothing and everything at the same time, if that makes sense? So I’m just confused. And maybe none of this even makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on with symptoms, but anyways, I just can’t seem to seperate what is gender identity, and what is my schizophrenia, which makes me question how to come out to my friends and family.

,schizophrenia,"      I (15)F was just recently diagnosed with schizophrenia. I have a feeling a lot of people are going to say I'm to young to get the diagnosis, but at this point I'm not even in early stages, I have the symptoms of someone who would have had it for years now. And no obviously it didn't happen over night.
      I've been full on panicking since I got the diagnosis, I feel the hallucinations and delusions have gotten worse bc I can't stop thinking about it. A year of doctors appointments, so many diagnosis. I prepared myself for all the possibilities. When schizophrenia crossed my mind, I didn't really read too much into it. A lot of my problems were blamed on other illnesses and childhood .
     My family sucks at keeping theses things to themselves especially if they could get the attention from other people. Too many people already know. Right now I'm doing online school, but I start public school again in 11ish days. I don't know who I'm supposed to tell or if some students are going to have to know in case I have a episode. I don't want other people to hear and think I'm crazy. I'm not crazy.
      This next part is going to really show the schizophrenia in me, but I'm scared. What if I'm the only real one and I'm in a simulation. And the goal is to not let people take other me. If I get on the medication it will shift my mind. I think the government knows I know too much. I've finally figured out what they've been doing. Or what if I'm not real and everyone else is. Maybe I'm a clone. I am a remake of somebody else who died. Is my brain my own??
      I have so many superstitions. I really do think I know to much and I don't know who to trust. Nothing feels real anymore. I know I haven't always been like this but I can't remember what it was like when I wasn't. Why can't I be normal. Why do I have to be the one to fight against the government. 
      Honestly at this point it's making me want to relapse on self harm or suicide. I just want to feel real. And if I am schizophrenic, I know I will be put into an institution eventually, and I don't want to go to places like that anymore. 
      If you've read my last posts, I've been in mental hospitals bc they were trying to see why I was the way I am.
      This is really hard to accept because I've had big dreams and everything is going down hill. Do any of you have schizophrenia or help people who do? I really need some advice and maybe just some details on what my life could look like from now.

I'll try to keep it short. I think there are cameras in my wall and I think I saw a lense once. I'm scares of mirrors and they must be avoided or faced away from me if possible.

I think everything has a meaning and an constantly trying to decipher it. Back in 2021-2022, I became obsessed with spirit numbers, 111 and 333 and 222 and so on. I would hallucinate these numbers. I would see blobs of color and messages in the air. They were meant for me. I'd also see random words and numbers. I see shadow faces and sparkles of white. I have visual snow syndrome though, so it could be that.

I have horrible mood swings. I sleep for 11-14 hours each night. I've been irritable my whole life but it's getting worse. I'm so on edge. My therapist said I have stress and anxiety that is so bad, my body has normalized it to the point where I can't discern it. I used to have false memories and extremely vivid dreams that I thought were memories. I had severe ocd and would wear multiple layers of gloves, wash my hands until they bled, and when it was really bad, I couldn't breathe a certain way or wouldn't touch a certain part of my bedframe while I slept. I would apologize to God and sob over the Bible. I'd force myself to smile. I'd pour bleach on my skin. I'd shower for hours. Laundry became a 5-hour process because I had to move clothes a certain way. It was hell.

Along with ocd, I've also been diagnosed with autism, schizoid pd, depression, anxiety, panic attack disorder, and we suspect I have ADHD.

Mentally, I feel like a child. I was born into a household that was a quiet type of abusive. I thought it was fine, but my adolescence was horrible. My parents were strict and gave me trauma that I suppressed.

Now my memory is bad. I forget things after a few seconds and I take it to mean my brain is trying to protect me by rejecting unnecessary information.

Right now, I have a hard time socializing. I can't speak right. I stutter and say the wrong words. I can't type right. I'm a writer but my hands will sometimes type the wrong thing that my brain thinks.

I don't know. Is this schizophrenia? I've been through 8 therapists and they say it's severe anxiety mixed with autism and ocd. I'm planning to meet with my psychiatrist soon to discuss meds. I'm on Zoloft and Abilify bit it's not helping. I've tried so many meds.

I've never taken drugs, so this is likely stress-related. Is it schizophrenia? It's really ruining my life. And would anyone recommend some coping strategies? Please don't say meditation. It's too hard for me.

TRIGGER WARNING: these paragraphs contain suicide and self harm

My aunt (40F) used to be such a happy person. She loved hanging out with me and we used to have so much fun together.

She’s getting worse. When she was just diagnosed with schizophrenia she couldn’t really talk to me she was just kinda staring into space.

She has a voice in her head and the voice in her head is Jesus. Jesus tells her that she is in a relationship with him. 

She tried to break up with her husband because she doesn’t want to be unloyal to Jesus. She has committed the 1st suicide attempt by an overdose to be with Jesus. When it didn’t work she was set to hospital and I saw her face it was completely purple. When it didn’t work she tried cutting herself and trying to hit a major artery

She tells me and my family who’s going to heaven and hell because Jesus has told her, apparently I’m going to heaven and her parents are going to hell.

She has tried to commit suicide once again and she got sent to a mental hospital which she has escaped multiple times and ran out bare foot. 

I just hate to see her struggling and my cousins are her children, I feel really bad for them to see their mother in such a bad way.

So my aunt can’t spend Christmas with her family and I just feel so awful for her. I know it’s for a good reason tho.

I just needed to get this out because I’ve been crying so much because I care about her as she’s cared about my many years, we used to be so close and she’s not herself anymore she used to be so bubbly and happy and o went to visit her and she’s as skinny as anything she looks so poorly ",t2_lw5gltnb4,False,,0,False,My aunt has schizophrenia and she’s really getting worse,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18p8hgf,False,light,1.0,,public,13,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger Warning,False,13,,False,False,,1703355213.0,,[],{},,,True,,1703346709.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is more a vent because I’m really worried about her.&lt;/p&gt;

She went to a psychiatric hospital a month ago they gave her antipsychosis pills
And damn well I know she needed that, for years i knew she struggles but it took time for her to make a move and I'm glad she's in a place that helps her now

And at first I was asking if she wants me to come visit her next week and then I changed my mind and told her maybe two weeks from now I'll come
Then she said ""God will make you come sooner I know it"" and my heart broke. I didn't say anything and just said let's see how this week goes.

And honestly she said a few things about God and the friendship we have, and that she was praying to God and that I am the answer

Anyway.... in my eyes I don't think it'll be good to visit her. At all. Not even talking to her.
I'm afraid it might be dangerous with her delusions.

 she is not aware at all of hers and thinks that she's okay and only has depression and anxiety and that's it.

It breaks my heart. I am her only friend. She lost all of her friends due to what she goes through (she stayed at home for years).

She's amazing and I love her, but I care enough to not hurt her.

,schizophrenia,"Hey everyone, I just made this account to ask a question that’s been on my mind that my psych hasn’t helped me address yet. I looked over the about section and FAQs so I hope I didn’t miss anything that would violate the guidelines! I am also on the mobile site so I apologize for any weird formatting errors.

To start, I am not diagnosed with schizophrenia but I am diagnosed bipolar and harm-type OCD. I am on two different medications to treat these respective diagnoses, but my OCD meds are anti-psychotics that are very rarely ever prescribed for OCD and are more common for schizophrenia and symptoms that relate to such. These meds do help, but I think my psych is a bit lost on “what” I might actually be. 

The reason I say this is because I experience (what I think are) delusions, although my descriptions of such might sound more like hallucinations. (Trigger Warning Ahead) It starts when I become very paranoid that there are bugs in my walls (a big OCD trigger for me) and devolves into me “seeing” the walls moving or pulsating to the motions of the bugs or “hearing” the bugs moving in them. The reason for the quotes is because I’m not sure that I “see” or “hear” these as much as I sort of feel them doing that, if that makes sense. Once I hit this stage, I can either stay in that paranoid/delusional state or it can worsen and I become much more paranoid about other things— like people following me, trying to hurt me, or that bugs have now spread to anything I touch. Basically I don’t feel safe anywhere, even my feet touching the ground or any surface makes me want to vomit or scream, and I don’t trust anyone around me, even my partner who I very much love. 

I guess I’m just wondering how you can tell the difference between hallucinations and delusions? I think I do “see” or “hear” things, but I’ve heard people who are diagnosed with schizophrenia describe auditory or visual hallucinations and they seem much more intense than what I experience. 

I know this is a general question but any insight would be super appreciated, especially because I’m kind of anxious about talking to my psych more deeply about it.
