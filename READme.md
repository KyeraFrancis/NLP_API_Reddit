# Classification Model for Reddit Posts Using NLP

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a classification model that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to accurately categorize Reddit posts into specific subreddits. The primary focus is on military-related subreddits such as 'army' and 'usmc', along with mental health-related subreddits like 'schizophrenic' and 'bipolar'.

### Goal

The goal is to understand the morale among 'usmc' and 'army' subreddit members and to gauge the general state of the armed forces. Additionally, a comparative analysis of sentiment in 'schizophrenic' vs 'bipolar' subreddits will be conducted.

## Data Science Process

### 1. Problem Statement

- Define the need for a classification model and its relevance in understanding subreddit dynamics.
- Discuss the significance of sentiment analysis in this context.

### 2. Data Collection

- Describe the process of gathering data from Reddit using APIs.
- Mention the specific subreddits targeted: 'army', 'usmc', 'schizophrenic', and 'bipolar'.

### 3. Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Outline steps taken for cleaning the data.
- Present initial findings from the EDA, focusing on patterns and anomalies.

### 4. Preprocessing & Modeling

- Discuss the NLP techniques used for data preprocessing.
- Describe the modeling approach and algorithms considered for the classification task.

### 5. Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding

- Explain the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.
- Discuss the model's ability to accurately classify posts into the respective subreddits.

### 6. Conclusion and Recommendations

- Summarize key findings.
- Provide recommendations based on the study's outcomes.

## Sentiment Analysis

- Detail the methodology used for sentiment analysis on each subreddit.
- Compare and contrast sentiments between grouped subreddits ('army' vs 'usmc' and 'schizophrenic' vs 'bipolar').

## Word Cloud Generation

- Describe the process of creating word clouds for each subreddit.
- Analyze the word clouds to infer dominant themes and sentiments.

## Final Thoughts

- Reflect on the implications of the findings for understanding the morale within the 'army' and 'usmc' communities.
- Discuss the broader impact of sentiment analysis in understanding online communities.
