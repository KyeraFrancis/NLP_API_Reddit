Hi, what advice do you wish you knew early on in your treatment/diagnosis of BD? I'm open to hearing anything. But given my circumstances, I'm especially interested in mitigating the pain that BD often inflicts on SO's, friends, family, etc. Any constructive advice/criticism is welcome.

### Backstory  
I'm a 30'sM with diagnosed&amp;medicated BD2. I'm only 3 months into diagnosis, still finding meds (Lithium+Depakote) that work for me, maintaining a high level of work/life/social/therapy/personal wellbeing, and am in the process of attempting reconcilliation with my (living apart) ex-fiance. I'm far from great, but considering the number of rock bottoms in my life, I'm doing well.

My symptoms started strongly expressing after both of my parents died days apart in 2020 (not COVID related). Up until then, I could communicate and perceive reality clearly. I'm a recovering addict who had a decade under his belt before rocketing towardsvtgis new flavor of hypomanic/mixed episode. While I was still my loving and goofy self, I started gaslighting my ex when she would understandably express concern. That turned into further detachment from trusting others, and both manipulating and controlling people and situations. I then took on my parents' estates w/o lawyers (didn't need to), and was fueled by a great deal of shame and trauma. This ""valid"" obsession allowed me to get away with a lot while grieving, and few others could see how different I had become. I was high functioining until I wasn't.

Around the time of closing each estate's probate case, I placed my hypomanic energy into a fear of abandonment that drove me to curate relationships, both platonic and one romantic for a childhood friend, to help me navigate my new unhinged version of reality. While I expressed love in countless healthy ways, I was also absent for my ex in ways that truly mattered as she navigated her own grief and traumas. I started fantasizing about ""ideal"" realities to help me cope with feeling unsafe in my own body.

Finally, after an array of triggers stacked a year ago - flu, rsv, covid, long covid, being alone, grief, and normal holiday anxiety - I allowed my other reality all the footing and outwardly expressed ""love"" to someone else on the phone. I thought that once she didn't reciprocate, then we could go back to friendship. She had become like a ""mom surrogate"" and we had been trauma bonded since childhood. To my surprise in that reality, no, friendship was not safe for her, and we stopped talking.

Months later, I told my ex the partial truth about the other woman, and denied the rest. Instead of saying I thought I loved her, I told her the closest truth I actually believed: I only had ""feelings"" for my friend. I didn't say the ""love"" had faded along with a hypomanic state. I didn't understand what BD, hypomania, mixed episode, or any of what I was experiencing actually was. Had I known then maybe something could have gone differently. All I knew for certain in my reality was: **they will all leave me if they know I don't understand myself anymore.**

After the facts of the emotional affair came out, my ex left me within the week. I became suicidal, obsessive, confused about my old therapist saying I definitely don't have bipolar, left that therapist, did a codepency retreat, joined 12 Step SLAA for love addiction, found a psychiatrist, got diagnosed ADHD, left psychiatrist as he was a dick, and **finally** found a psychiatrist + therapist that I can trust all of myself with, and was formally diagnosed and treated for BD2 😌  I would not be alive without my care team.

Now, my ex and I are in the process of a full disclosure to give her everything she needs to heal from the emotional affair, and hopefully process some of the pain of almost marrying someone who wasn't aware of their own BD (i.e. provide her moments in the relationship where BD took the wheel and gaslit, manipulated, or was cruel to her). There's no promise to reconcile, but it's the necessary first step.

It's been a very, very intense week as the holidays are primed to find all the cracks in my BD treatment plan, and introduce brand new triggers. lol thanks Santa 🎁. Even with a decade of therapy and success with some meds, I still find myself disappointing and hurting her even with the best of intentions + planning (e.g. communication blunders on both ends, oversharing, expecting too much too soon, etc.). I have a CSAT therapist for the emotional affair work, and one for BD2/ADHD. Meds and therapy are life saving and I'm improving. My shame is shifting towards more acceptance more often than not (well, except during trigger week... er, I mean ""the holidays"" 🫠).

But, I'm soberly aware that if I keep up at even this rate of healing, there will be no option for reconciliation. Even though it breaks my heart to imagine a lifetime without her, I can't blame her if the day-to-day of a BD2 SO would not be worth it for her (especially after my betrayal). Or, she just doesn't have that level of commitment to provide me/us given her own trauma history that she'll be unpacking for years to come. It's been promising to hear her talk about reading so much on bipolar, and asking questions and trying to make plans about what the relationship would look like given both of our needs. I pray there's hope for us but I see clearly how much I am asking of her to not only trust me again, but to trust that a relationship with a BD2 partner (even) in treatment could be safe and lead to a fulfilling life for her+me.

I have to make sure I don't unnecessarily hurt her or myself further because of manageable elements of BD2.

&lt;p&gt;Hi, what advice do you wish you knew early on in your treatment/diagnosis of BD? I&amp;#39;m open to hearing anything. But given my circumstances, I&amp;#39;m especially interested in mitigating the pain that BD often inflicts on SO&amp;#39;s, friends, family, etc. Any constructive advice/criticism is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Backstory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 30&amp;#39;sM with diagnosed&amp;amp;medicated BD2. I&amp;#39;m only 3 months into diagnosis, still finding meds (Lithium+Depakote) that work for me, maintaining a high level of work/life/social/therapy/personal wellbeing, and am in the process of attempting reconcilliation with my (living apart) ex-fiance. I&amp;#39;m far from great, but considering the number of rock bottoms in my life, I&amp;#39;m doing well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My symptoms started strongly expressing after both of my parents died days apart in 2020 (not COVID related). Up until then, I could communicate and perceive reality clearly. I&amp;#39;m a recovering addict who had a decade under his belt before rocketing towardsvtgis new flavor of hypomanic/mixed episode. While I was still my loving and goofy self, I started gaslighting my ex when she would understandably express concern. That turned into further detachment from trusting others, and both manipulating and controlling people and situations. I then took on my parents&amp;#39; estates w/o lawyers (didn&amp;#39;t need to), and was fueled by a great deal of shame and trauma. This &amp;quot;valid&amp;quot; obsession allowed me to get away with a lot while grieving, and few others could see how different I had become.

I'm currently stable, and well, not anxious depressed or manic. Also happy with my meds. Plus im feeling creative.

I've been manic more than six times. (lost track). I've been depressed for over a waking year of my life. Bedridden for most of it! I've struggled with suicidality for a year of my waking life. 

I just took Vancouver coastal health's peer support course and I got 97%! I start my practicum here in town shortly

I have been incredibly fortunate with what has been given to me. But I have also been smart and strong with my decision making and where I've been spending my time

Things that have helped me: 
Self advocacy with my psychiatrist
Spending time speaking with social workers
Quitting nicotine and alcohol
A rigid sleep schedule
Weightlifting
Meditating for at least 15 minutes per day
Calling support lines often
Keeping my space clean
Eating healthy (high protein, low sugar, fruit and veggies)
Socializing often (support lines help with that)
Taking my meds --1200mg lithium, 200mg lamotrigine, 10mg prozac, 15mg loxipine, 7.5mg zoplicone--
Walking daily
Diligent personal hygiene

HOWEVER, during my hypomanic episodes (which unfortunatly lasts like a day or 2,sucks) It would tell me I am an absoloute god, and no one can touch me, this earth is lucky I exist.

Every time I get stressed out or tired or busy or emotional or horny or feel anything basically, I get sad because it’s number now. I used to feel things so deeply! I wrote loads of weird stuff about it! I felt a deep kinship with Byron and Shelley and Coleridge and all the other genius writers “touched with fire”.. 

But now sure I write. 100k people have read what I write (this is not a delusion of grandeur! This is true!). But it’s not really the same. Used to be able to write as easily and automatically as breathing and now I have to think about it. I don’t like thinking about it. Even at school I never bothered planning anything with my essays, I just wrote, and I got full marks. I see people saying that meds stifling creativity is a myth, but I’m not so sure. I’m on lamotrigine and I’ve seen a Lot of chat here about word recall. I also can’t think of rhymes as easily! Half my sentences used to rhyme! I’d make amazing connections in seconds without thinking.. almost like automatic writing. 

And then there’s the other side effects. Weight gain (I was told it’d not have been an issue if I had more willpower), bad dreams (nightmares every night! I wake up crying in fear!). It is so boring wasting so much time sleeping. I used to have most of every night stretching out in front of me, so much time. So much power, being awake when other people are asleep. Getting about 5 hours of sleep at the moment so nowhere near dangerland. 

My meds don’t really stop me having episodes, either. Feels fairly pointless. Chemists always fucks it up and I have to waste half my life hunting down a basic fucking medication. And there is so much else to do!

I’m 20M w Bipolar 2, GAD, ADHD. I take lithium and I have been pretty stable for about a year now since my last manic episode.

So there’s a lot of positive things happening in my life right now

I just finished a whole semester of college for the first time in 2 years which feels amazing. My relationships have been going well and I feel pretty great generally with the holidays coming.

However I have started to notice some pretty major red flags concerning my mood. I have had trouble falling asleep, have been more talkative, more fixated/stimulated about stuff, etc. 

One of the things I did a lot when I was with mania and therefore is a warning sign is that I would change the things around me a lot (the arrangement of my furniture/decorations, the lighting, etc). In the last few days I have being trying to resist the urge to do these kind of things. 

So I’m pretty worried about going back into mania. After my last episode I took it upon myself to learn about this illness and so im pretty informed. Ill definitely be taking my meds religiously as well as and maintining a good sleep hygiene and all the basic stuff.

However I’m wondering if any of you have any experience seeing an episode coming and trying to prevent it.

I cycled so rapidly and eventually got into a deep psychotic episode. I’m finally on meds for about two years now and six months sober of everything.

Problem is I destroyed my memory of things I did! But apparently not permanently because things are starting to come back and I’m drowning in the shame and guilt that’s coming up.

I degraded myself so many times. For instance: I did porn for one of those live streaming websites (before OF was a thing) and bragged about it at my high school reunion. Had a threesome with my partner and kept contact with the third even though my partner said I had to stop and if I kept going it would be cheating. I stayed even though they were humiliating me and abusing me and I didnt want it. I signed up on sugar daddy websites and tried to be a sugar baby. That meant so many gross phone calls saying disgusting things and so many times I did this in front of my partner. Humiliated myself and my partner in front of their friends by asking about their sex lives the first time I met them and constantly keeping the conversation about sex. And so much more that keeps flooding into my mind. And I wasn’t even horny during any of it. All I remember is that I wanted attention, something to make me feel better and to know that I was wanted. 

My poor partner was there for me through everything even though I treated them like dirt. They’ve finally snapped and lost their love for me and probably is leaving me. I wish I could’ve taken my meds sooner and gotten sober sooner. I finally tried naltrexone and it’s the only thing keeping me from drinking. It’s like a miracle - I have zero cravings. They went away almost the same day I started that med.

I’m trying to forgive myself or at least be more understanding. I was traumatized with medications being forced into my mouth constantly (stuff I never needed) when I was a kid, so I couldn’t get over that in time before I imploded. I grew up with alcoholics that kept making me drink ever since I was a kid, too. I’m trying to tell myself that of course it’s ok I struggled before I got to this point.

But I can’t!! I can’t stand it!! I’m such a horrible person for what I did to my love, my person, my partner!! The list goes on and on and on and I can’t believe they stayed this long. I don’t blame them for needing to leave me, but I’m absolutely devastated.

,bipolar,"First, i'd like to wish you all a merry christmas and hope that you have a good time.

Five months ago, i [made this posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/14xw2y9/when_you_are_confronted_with_serious_problems_but/) here in this sub, i'd like to give you an update and i think, Christmas is a very good time to share this.

For those who don't have time to see the link, it was about the problems i faced, my parents were injured in a car crash, my dog was injured, my brother has cancer and i struggled with bipolar.

I'll tell you how it turned out: My parents survived, they still got some problems, but the doc expect a full recovery. They made it, got through with emergency surgery and then the entire process of rehab. It looks better for my brother about cancer, his body responds well to the treatment. There are more, rather small details, like i was able to avoid a relapse with drugs. My dog is also healthy again.

Today, we'll have a christmas dinner together at my family home and no seat will be empty, no one was lost. It was a hard time for all of us. It was at some points critical about life and death.

I'd like to thank the community here in the sub and also i was happy that some of you reached out to me with writing me DM's when i was in that long and dark night. It was the support i needed to keep going on.

Don't lose hope when you get confronted with such serious problems, where you don't know what is coming. Don't give up, even when the odds are stacked against you. In the end, you can still win and live to see better times.

Thanks for your support again, i'm really looking forward to our dinner and that we are all still alive, it's like a happy ending, even when it is just temporary. The good times are where you need to recover and gain new strength, so i will cherish every minute of this. 

P.S.  
They'll never get to read this i guess, but there were good people in the aftermath of the car crash, other cars stopped and civilians gave first aid to my parents, called the emergency services.

&lt;p&gt;Having written so much, I fear I’m currently in an anxiety induced mania that set me to hospital back in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t help I’m fighting with therapy office about payments that insurance says I didn’t have to pay for PLUS my therapist I’ve had good rapport with is out due to a car accident!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m feeling quite overwhelmed that I noticed it is now affecting me at work. I do have people I feel safe with that calm me but it is t always the same people every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably more a vent than helpful. Sorry. And anyone who’s read up to the end….thank you. I just need to know someone is out there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,
Struggling&lt;/p&gt;

So, I was already in a bad place and, recently, my mom's be diagnosed with breast cancer and I'm the one who's taking care of everything (going to doctor, dealing with her medical insurance).

We have been together for a long time and I love him a lot, so that's why I've never considered (and ""needed"" having sex with other guys until now. It feels like i'm gonna go crazy if I don't do that now, because life has been drowing me and I just need to release some pressure, but I know this is wrong and that he doesn't deserve that - which is the main reason why I haven't done anything physical.

19M 

I'm a transplant recipient and in april 2023 i went into hospital for organ rejection, the treatment for this is multiple steroids at a very very high dose example being 500mg of prednisone, the end result of this and at the time having no medication for bipolar i went into psychosis, i was in hospital from april to i think june or july? i remember none of this and only remember beginning of April and August (a bit of July)

July is when i finally got home from hospital and my Cat died.. so i was dealing with that aswell 


In between this i said some really shit things to my Mom, my little sister, my older brother and my friends.. all of which i don't remember and i only have texts of what i said (i have absolutely no idea of what else beyond this) 

The aftermath of my behavior? well... I'm not allowed to live with my Mom and Little sister, they aren't supporting me in anyway anymore and have told me we can't go back to the way things were because of what i did.. the information i was given of my behavior was this: I'm manipulative, i don't act like family, i guilt trip, i said i don't see my Mom as my mom or friend, i implied my mom doesn't do enough for me, i implied she's not good enough.

What sucks is i do not remember ANYTHING which is scary... i pride myself on being the best person i can be.. i have so much love to give i appreciate everything the people in my life have done for me i try to be understanding and listen to people and i take criticism well.. so it confuses me how i can act so differently and i don't even remember...

since all this happened I've done multiple things to make sure I'm a good person who is still worthy of my mothers love... I've been going to the gym, i stopped drinking completely, I've been going to therapy which is completely draining my wallet without coverage but whatever, I'm working more towards my goals.. I've been controlling myself so much better since being bipolar meds.

because of this i decided to have a conversation with my mother again... it was going well until i completely broke down and started crying and essentially begged for them to take me back... i attempted to explain the psychosis and i expressed how i was scared and the end result of me doing this was her saying i was guilt tripping her... even though to me atleast all i was doing was expressing how I've been feeling.. i didn't blame her for anything i never even brought her into it.. all i did was say the things i was feeling since she said i couldn't live with them anymore it's not like my intention was to manipulate or guilt trip i just needed my mom...

i expressed that i thought if i started improving myself everything would go back to normal and i was told that's not how family works and things will never go back to how they once were...

My living situation atm is a risk to my physical health, I'm likely going to need another transplant in a few years or sooner but i can't get one because i lack support now, I have an older brother but he lives in the states (I'm in Canada) so living with him isn't an option.. i am lost and scared and I'm trying my absolute hardest...

I put my trust in a select few to help me manage my condition.  A few days ago I was quite happy and anxiety seemed like a distant stranger.  I was putting on a show for my baby girl, singing &amp; dancing in the morning.  Then my husband looked at me strangely.  “Do… do I need to take today off of work?”  I was surprised.  Why would he ask me that?  He pointed out that I was unusually excited, talking fast, etc.  But I was just in a good mood, right? He asked me to check in with my therapist; perhaps he was mistaken.  

Later that day, my therapist confirmed that I was talking faster than usual.  “How’ve you been sleeping?” She asked.  Uh oh..  not very much sleep.  But that’s normal with a baby, right?  Except baby had been sleeping through the night &amp; I… had not.  

So I agreed to take the steps to address the hypo-mania.  I took my emergency, fast-acting anti-psychotic; cancelled a play date I had planned &amp; went to bed early that night.   I got 12 hrs of sleep.  Groggy, I emerged the next day after a hard reset.  Sure I don’t feel quite as sing-songy or ready to run a marathon.  But I feel good.  I listened to the people I trust and I took care of myself.  

 Even if the highs feel really good.  Even if they don’t exactly feel like highs, I know where they can lead.  I have responsibilities, a child to care for.  I’m thankful for my husband &amp; my therapist.  And I’m proud of myself. 

TL/ DR: I trusted my husband &amp; therapist when they identified I might be hypomanic &amp; took corrective action to manage my Bipolar.

,bipolar,"Hello! 

I am writing this because I need some perspective, insights and experiences. 

  
I have been diagnosed for roughly a year, but I have had this disorder for about 2.5-3 years. During this time I have never told my family, they know nothing about my well-being and I have liked to keep it separate. I live in another city and only see them once or twice a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the issue is that my conversation therapist has been pushing me lately to tell them. He believes that this would drop a stone off my shoulders. While he is likely correct, I can only see bad things coming out of this. My family very rarely talk about our issues and pains. Cronical illnesses are mentioned in passing by and serious pain is kept under the rug. This isn't healthy or good but it is how we do things. However, I also know that by telling my mother, the rest of my family and relatives would know within a week. I wouldn't want this. I also know that I would never get a moment of peace after telling her, everything would become about my well-being and she would never see me anymore only the disorder. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the real question is:

Is there anyone like me who didn't want to tell anyone but eventually did? What were the outcomes, do you regret it, etc. etc.

During this time I have never told my family, they know nothing about my well-being and I have liked to keep it separate. I live in another city and only see them once or twice a month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the issue is that my conversation therapist has been pushing me lately to tell them. He believes that this would drop a stone off my shoulders. While he is likely correct, I can only see bad things coming out of this. My family very rarely talk about our issues and pains. Cronical illnesses are mentioned in passing by and serious pain is kept under the rug. This isn&amp;#39;t healthy or good but it is how we do things. However, I also know that by telling my mother, the rest of my family and relatives would know within a week. I wouldn&amp;#39;t want this. I also know that I would never get a moment of peace after telling her, everything would become about my well-being and she would never see me anymore only the disorder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the real question is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anyone like me who didn&amp;#39;t want to tell anyone but eventually did? What were the outcomes, do you regret it, etc. etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate all answers and experiences that might help me make a decision. &lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"hey everyone this is my second ever reddit post so bear with me please. 

21F, i was diagnosed around 1.5/2 years ago after i had my first manic episode. i have also been diagnosed with GAD, a dissociative disorder, and PTSD. i am unmedicated for all of these willingly as i was on abilify, but could not take it consistently and my parents worried about the physical effects of going off and on meds (family history of blood clots, stroke, etc.). i started using daylio to track my moods and have worked on a lot of grounding/coping mechanisms to somewhat alleviate my various symptoms.

i’ve been staying with my family who i haven’t seen in a few years (i grew up with them but moved across the US when i was 15) and while it has been lovely, they are in poor health. my time here has been very sweet and i’ve been feeling good, but i can tell when i leave in a few days i’m probably going to have a depressive episode. 

i’ve dealt with my depression fairly well through my life, and i can identify it easily before i’m truly in the throes of it. the last true depressive episode i had was entirely different because i had what i can only describe as symptoms of psychosis (hallucinations, ideation, paranoia). does anyone have any tips on how to manage those symptoms if they come up? last time this happened i was on “watch” for two weeks and couldn’t work, which i can’t do this time due to my financial situation. 

i am also wondering if anyone has any tricks to identifying manic episodes. i’ve had a few but until i was diagnosed after my first, i hadn’t experienced that before. i tend to not understand my mania until i’m at the tail end of an episode, usually after i’ve done something reckless/“bad” (spending money, getting new jobs, driving for extreme amounts of time/traveling, etc.) i’m worried this time because if i am about to have a depressive episode, my family has expressed to me that i could move with them back to my home town. im worried that i will take them up on this offer and not completely think it through (leaving my current primary support system for a cross country move) 

i think the fact that im thinking about this now is a good sign, but i tend to dissociate during my manic episodes so im not sure if ill even remember the pros and cons of moving back to be with my family.

,bipolar,"First off, i wanna start by saying that this is pretty long.
If you don’t give a shit i completely understand, have a peaceful day. 

So, i’ve always fought to get a diagnosis because i thought that it would validate my experience and people would finally stop treating me like i’m exaggerating. Ive been to the psych clinic 2 times this year and i’ve been on meds and all that. But i hadn’t seen it on paper you know. And recently i finally did. Turns out i was diagnosed with bipolar? They just didn’t tell me. And now i feel empty and sad. I don’t want that diagnosis anymore because i feel like i can’t go back you know? It would be for life if i wasn’t diagnosed too but this feels more official. Everytime i see something about bipolar being for life, tears well in my eyes. Like yea congrats you’re stuck with this because we said so, the only thing you can do about it is take those meds that you hate and pay for expensive therapy sessions. 

I feel like an ingrate. I wanted someone to tell me that i wasn’t delusional but now that it has happened, i want the opposite. Please go back on your words and tell me it was just a phase and i won’t have to seriously consider ending it all anymore. I think i was in deep denial, in more than one way. I wanted to reassure myself that i wasn’t « worthless to society » and just a product of my trauma. But thinking about it now, i don’t actually give a shit about pleasing anyone in this depressing world. Am i fraud?
I’m conflicted because on one hand i don’t wanna be a burden to the people i genuinely care about, but on the other hand i don’t wanna be a « useful member of society » because i despise this disgusting society i live in. Besides the people i love i can’t think of a single reason i would want to hang on. I find fault in everything. I’m cynical and negative (i’m probably only saying this bc i’m depressed rn but whatever). I just can’t help myself, i don’t wanna keep the peace and no matter how hard i try to convince myself otherwise, i almost never want to put in effort. 
I know i’m not a terrible person, i have values, i try to help people as best as i can and i would never hurt anyone intentionally. So why do i feel so stupid and mean and unreasonable ??? :(

I'll lose my job and lose him anyway if I take 3-5 days to get help. I just missed 4 days for the flu. I will absolutely lose my job.

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t an &amp;quot;I wanna die&amp;quot; post but I think I&amp;#39;m slowly getting to the point where I should probably hospitalize myself. I&amp;#39;m in a depressive episode and have been fantasizing about taking my own life for most of the day. Pretty graphically and in depth to the point that it feels like pretty soon it&amp;#39;s just going to be me making a plan. But I have full custody of my child and if I go to the hospital, he will go into foster care. My family members will not watch him for me and I just spent the past year working to get custody back. I&amp;#39;ll lose my job and lose him anyway if I take 3-5 days to get help. I just missed 4 days for the flu. I will absolutely lose my job.

I was diagnosed professionally when I was a child at 7 and had therapy until I was 16.
I'm 25 now and since 17, I never medicate for it anymore and I take daily vitamins and have a focused diet to keep me more stable.

This is almost heartbreaking and I've repeatedly told him that I'm having episodes and I do my best to ground myself daily but they are very prevalent having bipolar.

,bipolar,"Hello, i hope everything and y’all are okay 🍀
I (26) diagnosed 2 years ago and i have met my exboyfriend (23) in this July while I have been stable for 2 months after a major depression. He was a traveler and my city was his last station. We bounded so fast, had great times together but we were hyping each other. I still don’t know if i have had a slight hypo mania or i was falling in love… Also we both couldn’t understand if it’s love or strong impression. By the time he visited me again, it didn’t go well this time. We had such intense conversations and pointless fights. The last day we decided to save the relationship and he went. We couldn’t make it, wished the best for each other and cut the painter.
After a little while he texted me some very awkward messages and asked to call. In this calling I could sense something was wrong about his mindset, he was talking about creating a new language and that kind of big things. Since we have a long distance I couldn’t do anything but worry. I felt like I was affecting his mind and I felt guilty. We ended talking 2,5 months ago till last Friday, he send my favorite perfume that he ordered while we were talking. I couldn’t take the shipping bcs of the customs. I texted to report what happened before he recoup and say thank you&amp;take care. He didn’t answer three days. I texted again taht “Can you please just send a sign that I can understand if you and we are okay? It beats me and i think we don’t deserve this. Any sign that i can make sense the situation is fair enough”. He said “Hey. We are completly ok. I had a psychosis two months ago. And now I’m trying to get better. It’s a shame that the parfume cannot arrive. I knew it would be a problem but I tried with the lying method.  Didnt work 🤷‍♂️. I hope you’re  doing ok as well. 
Take care” I felt devastated and i still do. I partly blame myself for his psychosis… It was his first serious relationship and came too much for him. Our lives were so different and the affection was unbalanced, he was the one got affected mostly.
I am saying partly because he was using mari since he was 17. Even though I know this is the main and rational reason for psychosis, I also know deeply that I triggered and contributed. when I saw his message I couldn’t stay rational and said “I can’t describe how much i am sorry Josh… I feel terrible about my unintentional contribution for this. At our last call I could sense something but I couldn’t do anything, I’ve felt like whatever I do would be another harm for you. I won’t hurt you again ever, I hope nothing can hurt your beautiful heart. I hope you get better and, the best 🤍” He didn’t respond.
I really feel so bad and I regret what I wrote. I don’t know if he didn’t respond because he blames me, too or we already said goodbye for the last time… I feel like shit.

By the time he visited me again, it didn’t go well this time. We had such intense conversations and pointless fights. The last day we decided to save the relationship and he went. We couldn’t make it, wished the best for each other and cut the painter.
After a little while he texted me some very awkward messages and asked to call. In this calling I could sense something was wrong about his mindset, he was talking about creating a new language and that kind of big things. Since we have a long distance I couldn’t do anything but worry. I felt like I was affecting his mind and I felt guilty. We ended talking 2,5 months ago till last Friday, he send my favorite perfume that he ordered while we were talking. I couldn’t take the shipping bcs of the customs. I texted to report what happened before he recoup and say thank you&amp;amp;take care. He didn’t answer three days. I texted again taht “Can you please just send a sign that I can understand if you and we are okay? It beats me and i think we don’t deserve this. Any sign that i can make sense the situation is fair enough”. He said “Hey. We are completly ok. I had a psychosis two months ago. And now I’m trying to get better. It’s a shame that the parfume cannot arrive. I knew it would be a problem but I tried with the lying method.  Didnt work 🤷‍♂️. I hope you’re  doing ok as well. 
Take care” I felt devastated and i still do. I partly blame myself for his psychosis… It was his first serious relationship and came too much for him. Our lives were so different and the affection was unbalanced, he was the one got affected mostly.
I am saying partly because he was using mari since he was 17. Even though I know this is the main and rational reason for psychosis, I also know deeply that I triggered and contributed. when I saw his message I couldn’t stay rational and said “I can’t describe how much i am sorry Josh… I feel terrible about my unintentional contribution for this. At our last call I could sense something but I couldn’t do anything, I’ve felt like whatever I do would be another harm for you. I won’t hurt you again ever, I hope nothing can hurt your beautiful heart. I hope you get better and, the best 🤍” He didn’t respond.
I really feel so bad and I regret what I wrote. I don’t know if he didn’t respond because he blames me, too or we already said goodbye for the last time… I feel like shit. What do you think I really need to hear something from outside thoughts. (Im sorry to take very long this post I couldn’t make it shorter, thank you for reading from here)&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"I’m writing this post as if to myself, but I figured it would be helpful (mainly for myself tbh) to share it with you folks.

I received my diagnosis a few months ago during the summer, and though my psychiatrist used a lot of words to describe me, the gist of it was that I have Bipolar I Disorder. His actual diagnostic impression was much more nuanced, but it all pointed to the same thing:

There’s something wrong with me; I’m unstable in the most explicit sense of the word.

That’s what it all pointed to, but I’ve come to learn I’m much more than bipolar. I had my first true mania a year ago, and it got so bad (I became psychotic) that I had to withdraw from school and take a semester off.

I came back and I had to withdraw again, this time because I was too depressed. I was in the throes of a cannabis addiction, and things weren’t looking good.

I feel like myself again, though, and I’ve finally got it. I can’t tell you the moment I felt it, but at some point the broken pieces of my life came together like a puzzle. Like kintsugi. I can feel things start to turn around for me, even if I don’t always know with certainty.

Ever since I ‘misplaced my mind’ last year, people look at me differently, and never in my life have I been so solitary. I’ve decided, then, that I need to learn to keep myself company. And I have. My diagnosis is very isolating, but I’ve finally made some peace with it. Mental illness or no, it’s me all the way down, and the people who I care about won’t judge me.

I can’t wait to see how much I improve next year.

,bipolar,"Background story

&amp;#x200B;

I had depression since I was 13 years old. Nevertheless, I studied hard to go to a good college. When I entered my college, the department office tried to open an interview with a decent TV channel. (At least to my professors, I was an exceptionally good case.) I showed the symptoms of depression, but I was unmedicated because I did not know anything about mental health issues. I just thought ""it is what it is"" and bottled up my issues. It was only third year of college that I went to doc. (this was 2017)

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since 2017, I started taking depression meds. Of course, they did not work out. Back then, I did not know I was bipolar. So I worked my ass off WITHOUT the help of mood stabilizers and what not.  Still, (thanks to caffeine and nicotine) I graduated college with a good GPA.

Everything seemed perfect. I started my MA degree at the fall of 2021. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now

However, things got fucked up. In 2021 winter, My first hypomanic episode occurred. I was not hospitalized, but I went to several hospitals to change meds. 

Ever since 2022, I feel like a different person. I think my function is deteriorating. I became lazy and depressed. I could not meet deadlines. I almost failed all classes. It kinda affected my concentration and attention. Very recently I have a hard time reading novels. (I am literature major and I used to read and write a lot)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, all these things being said, do you think I should my career?

I have always considered doing GRE or LSAT to fulfill my life goals. But unfortunately things got fucked up.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had depression since I was 13 years old. Nevertheless, I studied hard to go to a good college. When I entered my college, the department office tried to open an interview with a decent TV channel. (At least to my professors, I was an exceptionally good case.) I showed the symptoms of depression, but I was unmedicated because I did not know anything about mental health issues. I just thought &amp;quot;it is what it is&amp;quot; and bottled up my issues. It was only third year of college that I went to doc. (this was 2017)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since 2017, I started taking depression meds. Of course, they did not work out. Back then, I did not know I was bipolar. So I worked my ass off WITHOUT the help of mood stabilizers and what not.  Still, (thanks to caffeine and nicotine) I graduated college with a good GPA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything seemed perfect. I started my MA degree at the fall of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, things got fucked up. In 2021 winter, My first hypomanic episode occurred. I was not hospitalized, but I went to several hospitals to change meds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since 2022, I feel like a different person. I think my function is deteriorating. I became lazy and depressed. I could not meet deadlines. I almost failed all classes. It kinda affected my concentration and attention. Very recently I have a hard time reading novels. (I am literature major and I used to read and write a lot)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all these things being said, do you think I should my career?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always considered doing GRE or LSAT to fulfill my life goals. But unfortunately things got fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think I have to give up and change career? lmao&lt;/p&gt;

I just wanted to take a second to remind whoever is reading this, you are not alone. 

I was diagnosed with BPd at the age of 31. Now five years later this year in 2023 has been one of the worst years of my life.

Looking back I couldn’t believe what I’ve accomplished this year for the sake of mental health.

New Job, less stress, good insurance, good meds.

My spouse notices I’m “pulling away” so decides to give me space. I tell him I don’t want to talk abt it bc I already see how the conversation will go down. He says he’ll give me space.

,bipolar,"Most of the time I’m fine, I guess. I live on my own, can generally hold down a job, and “take care of myself”. That being said, it gets the better of me sometimes.

Every time it happens I recognize it, I promise it won’t happen again, and then it does. Part of my issue is probably narcissism, in the way I get offended in the first place. 

Tonight at Christmas dinner I was on my phone looking at a group chat that I’m in with my friends. My friends were making jokes about my sexuality (I’m bisexual) and saying I would suck dicks for money if I was traveling and needed money. One of them said I’d make an igloo out of cum and live in it. I got really upset, sent back very personally attacking messages saying the worst, friendship ending, things I could. The next level to this is that I was now in a terrible mood and on the verge of tears. I had to leave the dinner early because I was so upset and didn’t want my mood to ruin everyone else’s night.

,bipolar,"Hi, I’m new to this Reddit and I would love to just hear some thoughts and advice is greatly appreciated. 

I’m 31, F and has been going through life with a major depression diagnosis from age 15. 

This last year I was in the process of being possibly diagnosed with adhd, which branched out to possibly be cptsd. It’s been a long year of self discovery to say the least. 

But then I had an episode, which seems to most likely be hypomania, as I suddenly felt happy and not needing to sleep. I didn’t do anything drastic, I just felt happy which was new to me. I could go be with friends and people without being tired for days after, I liked myself, I didn’t ruminate or have my usual panic attacks. I didn’t hate myself, and I suddenly felt my libido coming back. 

When I couldn’t sleep and I was disassociating I understood something was wrong, and I’m in contact with my doctors and family and they suspect bipolar 2. 

Now that I’m no longer in hypomanic state, I’m very confused as life doesn’t feel the same anymore. I’ve gotten the taste of what happiness should feel like, so now I’ve stopped to force myself to do things to seem happy. But this makes me not able to function as an adult. I’ve lost my job (which weren’t a good match for me anyway, it was a bad environment for people with mental health struggles), and I should feel like a failure. But I don’t, I feel content with just existing. And this scares me. My whole life has changed after this experience, and now I feel like there’s a current of emotions and triggers flowing through me, but as long as I just try to stay calm and don’t push myself, it doesn’t affect me as much anymore. 

Is this normal? To go from being severely depressed (with ocd, social anxiety, panic attacks, ed, body dysmorphia and more) to suddenly just feeling content and suddenly confident and loving myself? I’ve done things I’ve been to scared to do my whole life (be open about myself, trust my friends, set boundaries, taken care of myself by speaking up, be confident in my body (I managed to reach the top while rock climbing for the first time in my life, I’ve been climbing for over a year)).

My friends and family tells me they don’t see me do anything that warrants me being hypomanic right now, and I don’t feel like I am right now. But I still have remnants of happiness and confidence, and it’s confusing.

A few days ago, I had a traumatic(?) experience. Since then, I have been feeling depressed. Last night when sitting outside with my partner, I became mute.

I felt affectively neutral during this. I have been feeling ‘off’ since the event, and have felt a lot angrier. The past few months I’ve been feeling more distrustful and a bit down but not depressed. I think the distrust is bleeding into my life from a toxic work environment.

,bipolar,"I got my currently job on September of this year after a clusterfuck hiatus down spiral bullshit that happened during my last job where I end up hospitalized and unemployed for over 3 months.

I’m a registered nurse. This would be my first job acting as such. Before I had worked on other clinical settings but as a student or an assistant nurse. I was glad of having the opportunity more so because the initial gig was too good to be true. Then I got kicked out of my first role and forced to do something I didn’t want to and hate.

Three months in and I always try not to dwell on it. Try to change mi mindset every day to the fact that I’m learning a bunch of different things that otherwise I wouldn’t, that I live 15 mins from work and that I don’t expect to be there more than a year or two.

It is hard, very hard. So hard that there’s been days where I had to call in because I was in crisis. It has been hell for me to comply with my meds regime because of the crazy hours and too much to do to even stop for taking them plus they were making me have tremors and I hated it because patients would get scare and think that I was being nervous.


Calling in just got me into trouble now with Human Resources being concern of my repetitive absences. I tried to explain it to my supervisor and let them know that I can’t always provide evidence since my issue is a mental health condition and my doctors won’t be available to me unless I have an appointment which has been a pain in the ass to get one lately because I assume they are on vacation.

I haven’t been able to enjoy the holidays. Didn’t decorate or celebrated shit because I’ve been having rough days lately. I was only looking forward to New Year’s Eve because I was going to be off the next day and that’s gone as well. I just woke up with a message from my supervisor telling that he had to change my shift to a night one because people already called in sick for New Year’s. I was furious because I find it unfair for many reasons including him allowing it from so early and because I had already shared my mental health issues with him and instead of picking someone else he chose me. 

Of course I felt pressure to accept it because of my current situation with HR and because I’m new. But I’m not having a great year at all and certainly hope I could celebrate the fucker away with a bang and cant even do that.

Is so hard to explain yourself and what you’re going through without them believing you’re irresponsable or lazy. This whole shit has drained me to the point where now my body is manifesting physical symptoms.

Add oil to a fire

If I light up perhaps they won’t leave me

Harm of flopping like a fish in dry air

All I need is a snare to mistake for support 

Meet and dissolve with a ghost

Get worked up when I lie to myself

Never ill—just tore a gill and I can’t get up the fall

Won’t you peck at me?

Claw me like a monster

Call it help

Netted in a cow catcher

Frantic to have gills wet

When no support around

So bloated

You a tick to me

I feel like disease 

People don’t want my name

Just something to bleed

Unfair deal

Why must I be the one situated in need?

Only got heard when I folded like a chair

Polished knees

Branches with leaves are heading to dead and don’t bend but break

Better if stranded that tethered to another’s totem

Sometimes feel accepted when I’m treated as a bulletin board

Lonely on a steppe with no clan to claim

Get cornered when vulnerable

Polished as a floor

Sediments falling as confetti

Meshed to it 

Like combines over me to be taken off

Tear like cloth

Wrapped on branches as a charm

To cook and rattle as a snake 

Cannibalizing 

I eat my own tail

Eaten

&lt;p&gt;You a tick to me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like disease &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t want my name&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just something to bleed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfair deal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why must I be the one situated in need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only got heard when I folded like a chair&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polished knees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Branches with leaves are heading to dead and don’t bend but break&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better if stranded that tethered to another’s totem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes feel accepted when I’m treated as a bulletin board&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lonely on a steppe with no clan to claim&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get cornered when vulnerable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polished as a floor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sediments falling as confetti&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meshed to it &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like combines over me to be taken off&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tear like cloth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrapped on branches as a charm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cook and rattle as a snake &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cannibalizing &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eat my own tail&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eaten&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No recourse.&lt;/p&gt;

Lately I have been doing some research and found that Risperidone could cause lack of period. I stopped it cold turkey (I know) because I was scared, and when we retested my blood, prolactin was at a much safer range even though it was still very high.

,bipolar,"Me (32F) and my bf (31M) have been together for 3 years, living together for 6 months, and this summer we decided to get married. Our wedding is scheduled for April next year.

I was diagnosed bipolar when I was 16, and I have been suicidal for the last 7 years or so. When I was 16, I started a 7 year on and off relationship with someone who lied a lot and tried to manipulate me, and that relationship really changed me in a very negative way and affected my relationships ever since.

I agreed to marry my bf because I was absolutely sure that I would kill myself one day, and I wanted my bf to inherit my house. This has to do with the laws in our country but your partner is not your heir unless you are legally married and you cannot freely dispose of everything you own in a will. The house we live is mine (I have a mortgage, but I paid the down payment all alone), and I'm doing well financially but he is not.

I was never in love with my boyfriend, but I do love him; I started a relationship with him because I was lonely and I think he was lonely too. He is a kind hearted, supportive person. We have the same sense of humor and we share one specific interest, but that's it. I'm a bit of brainy person and I can't have any deep conversation with him because he sees the world in black and white terms and he doesn't read or try to learn. He's in a low paid job and believes he'll only advance in life if he wins the lottery. He lived with his parents until he was 31 and he never did any chores. He's still a bit hopeless around the house. He has his chores that he does half-assed so momma (me) doesn't scold him. He can't do a load of laundry or fix a lightbulb or use the stove. Our sex life is meh. I believe sexual compatibility can be worked on, but ours has only improved slightly, he's a bit clumsy and slow to take feedback and he once did something I don't like and wouldn't stop even when I told him. We're not even doing anything for our wedding because he can't afford it, we're only getting married at the registry. I wanted an elopement but he can't afford it. But he can afford spending thousands of $ on legos.

I think our relationship has nothing wrong, but nothing too good about it either. We're probably more friends than lovers and I think that is something awesome to have in old age, but I'm only 32.

About 2 months ago my meds changed, I'm now on lamotrigine 200mg + quetiapine 200mg. And for the first time in 7 yrs I am not suicidal. And I'm reconsidering if I want to get married or not.

I'm really not sure what I think. I'm sure I'm not in love with him but I do love him for who he is. I think maybe I can live without sex. 

I always get a bit depressed during Christmas time, and that may be clouding my judgement. I have a track record of jumping into relationships impulsively because I feel lonely, and I imagine people instead of taking them for who they are. But for the first time in my life I feel like I want to be alone. But I'm afraid I may get lonely again down the road. And my bf does keep me company, and except for not being very helpful around the house he's generally fun to live with.

I've been feeling lethargic, which is normal for me during this time of the year. However the meds are great because it's the first time in years that I feel sad but don't think about killing myself.

I'm sure that if I break up with my bf, he'll move back in with his family since he doesn't make enough money to support himself. His parents were dying to get him out of the house and he doesn't even have a bedroom in their home any longer. It really saddens me to think that he will be lonely and sad and living back home with his parents. I think he has potential but he's not advancing in life because he has a victim mentality and can't think critically about himself.

We&amp;#39;re not even doing anything for our wedding because he can&amp;#39;t afford it, we&amp;#39;re only getting married at the registry. I wanted an elopement but he can&amp;#39;t afford it. But he can afford spending thousands of $ on legos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think our relationship has nothing wrong, but nothing too good about it either. We&amp;#39;re probably more friends than lovers and I think that is something awesome to have in old age, but I&amp;#39;m only 32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 2 months ago my meds changed, I&amp;#39;m now on lamotrigine 200mg + quetiapine 200mg. And for the first time in 7 yrs I am not suicidal. And I&amp;#39;m reconsidering if I want to get married or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really not sure what I think. I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;m not in love with him but I do love him for who he is. I think maybe I can live without sex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always get a bit depressed during Christmas time, and that may be clouding my judgement. I have a track record of jumping into relationships impulsively because I feel lonely, and I imagine people instead of taking them for who they are. But for the first time in my life I feel like I want to be alone. But I&amp;#39;m afraid I may get lonely again down the road. And my bf does keep me company, and except for not being very helpful around the house he&amp;#39;s generally fun to live with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been feeling lethargic, which is normal for me during this time of the year. However the meds are great because it&amp;#39;s the first time in years that I feel sad but don&amp;#39;t think about killing myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure that if I break up with my bf, he&amp;#39;ll move back in with his family since he doesn&amp;#39;t make enough money to support himself. His parents were dying to get him out of the house and he doesn&amp;#39;t even have a bedroom in their home any longer. It really saddens me to think that he will be lonely and sad and living back home with his parents. I think he has potential but he&amp;#39;s not advancing in life because he has a victim mentality and can&amp;#39;t think critically about himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So...I really have no idea what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

Just wanted to jot down my own thoughts, feel free to share your own journey. 

During the summer I had a mental breakdown (this is what my therapist called it) which led to me taking a decent attempt at my life. 

What followed was months of depression and a whole lot of suicidal ideation. I honestly didn't think I would get out of that hole/couldn't see a way out of it.

Very slowly, with therapy sessions every week, I'm at the stage today where I can breathe without feeling suffocated. I've gone from a very high safety risk to a very low risk with little to no suicidal ideation. 

I never thought I would get to the stage of looking forward to what the future brings. (No job, on disability, with half a degree) but I no longer care about all of that stuff. It took me 27 years to finally start caring about my own self.

,bipolar,"Regardless of how well I'm doing, regardless of how successful I am in managing life, projects and people.... I will take the first chance to dissociate. By dissociate, I mean getting holed up at home and simply shutting off reality - not checking my phone, emails, not answering anything - and sleeping excessively or just devoting my waking hours to learning more about some of my obsessions, daydreaming or binge-watching shows. Anyway, it's always an activity that's not integral to my life in any way. I stop reading, learning, communicating, working, writing... and just exist on another level, untouchable, unfocused, unbothered by Life. I live for that feeling of being disconnected. It's my ultimate fantasy and greatest reward.

Yeah, that's how it feels... as if though I have succeeded at hiding from space and time, and god-awful messaging apps.

Actually, even on a good day (being productive, active, etc), in the evening I must have an hour or two of total dissociation, just existing in a fantasy world, before going to bed. It's like I need to wash off reality from me.

This is causing shitstorms in my life... I forget to reply something important to someone, I tend to forget or cancel my client appointments, I might overlook a super crucial email... it makes me look flaky, uninterested, irresponsible.... and I hate that, especially now as I'm doing all I can to rebuild a worthy life for myself.... but it happens all the time... it's like a super strong need within me, it's like I can't live without taking pauses from this world. It scares me. And it makes me really sad.

,bipolar,"Hi everyone 
I’m 19 years old and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder earlier this year. I’ve noticed when I go into episodes I leave…like physically run away and it scares the shit out of my family and sometimes even myself, when it happens it’s like I am a different person and can’t control myself. My family will frantically be calling and texting me but I just won’t answer them and make them think something awful happened to me. My most recent and most dangerous one happened tonight. I walked probably about 30 minutes in pitch black darkness on a busy highway from my grandparents house to my house: everyone was frantically calling me but I ignored everything. It all happened over a fight I had with my mother and sister. I’ve also had a pretty rough few days.
Does anyone else do this? I’m worried that one day I do something like this and get myself in a legit dangerous situation. I scared my mother so much she won’t speak to me. I get this mentality that no one cares about me and wouldn’t if I died/got kidnapped. When I snap out of these episodes I feel a Major sense of guilt.

,bipolar,"Hello! I am new to this subreddit but have been living with Bipolar I for several years. I am a young adult, so I’m still going through development and I’ve noticed  how my bipolar has changed throughout the years and this is a newer symptom.

I recently came out of a manic episode that lasted about a month or a bit longer from September to October. Since then I’ve been dealing with large amounts of irritability; arguably before the episode as well I think. I don’t believe I payed good enough attention to this until after the episode. The anger I felt during the episode was… aggressive. I had to create a safety plan because I wanted to hurt someone and was soooo mad at my therapist- who I literally love😔. I made such horrible decisions during my episode that don’t fit me at all. I’ve been feeling the effects of that recently with the mental analysis eating me up.

I cannot shake the anger though. I stare at people when upset because I can’t calm down. If I can’t speak I still try to convey a sense of control. I want to squeeze glass cups in my hand when I think of things that anger me (I typically analyze things that have happened when eating bc I don’t eat with electronics around, and we only have glass cups).

I'm also sorry if this post comes out weird formatting-wise, I am not super familiar with Reddit. Final apology, I did not find any duplicates of these questions but I apologize if I maybe just missed them.

I have two real questions about my depressive episodes.

My first, is there a difference between a depressive episode and just experiencing sad things in life?I have been really depressed for a while. It's been about the same amount of time as previous depressive episodes except where those didn't have a reason, I believe this one has come as a direct result of a problem I've been dealing with with a really close friend.

I know that not every time I get sad is a depressive episode. And I know that people without bipolar disorder get sad. But is being depressed and miserable for weeks because of a problem that's been persisting for weeks a depressive episode? Or am I just sad? Does that make sense?

And second is about insomnia. In this depression I've been dealing with for the last couple months, I haven't been sleeping much at all. The most I've slept on any given night is just under four hours and even that was kind of a miracle.

I'm not doing anything stimulating, all devices are powered off and put away, I just stare at the ceiling for hours. Sometimes thinking, sometimes not thinking at all. I am constantly exhausted but no matter how tired I am, I cannot sleep even a little bit.

I have tried melatonin, magnesium, and every other thing I could find on the internet, but nothing's helped. And I can't do prescription sleep medication because I have a history of abusing them.

So my question is is this normal? Is there anything I can do? Or do I just kind of have to ride it out?

,bipolar,"I feel like I've just been slapped in the face by a depression ghost. Like it just snuck up behind me, knocked the wind out of my lungs and sucked every atom of goodness from my body in literal seconds.

For context, I was diagnosed bipolar three years ago and have managed it successfully with meds. I can work late, stress moderately, enjoy the occassional drink, and even pull off the odd all-nighter, all without any serious shift in mood. 

But after spending most of today with friends and family, laughing over a few beers, I got home, walked into my bedroom and just felt the life drain out of me.

I very nearly forgot what this kind of depression felt like.
It's this thick cloud of darkness that swallows you up. 
An unbearable weight of despair, from which only thoughts of worthlessness and paranoia can grow. 
A sadness so deep, without reason or explanation, that it ignites fear - fear that it cannot be justified or controlled.
Fear that no one will understand, or would want to understand. 
Fear that I am alone. 
I look in the mirror and wonder why I even exist. Everything around me is grey and lifeless and I feel useless and pathetic. I start to believe that my life contributes nothing to this world and that my existence is a bane to all those around me.

Its been a while since I last felt this way and I have no idea what triggered this episode.. But previous experience has taught me a few coping techniques:

- Sleep is usually always the best remedy. 
- As painful as it feels now, its usually less so by tomorrow. 
- And an early dose of (prescribed) quetiapine can bring sleep on much, much quicker. 
- If the above doesn't work then I know to call my psychiatrist for help. 
Knowing all of this is usually the reassurance I need to get me through the day.


I actually came here to remind myself that depression is a familiar burden shared by many in this sub. I remember that I am not alone, and that in itself is a relief. 
I also wanted to document this experience for myself, as a kind of reassuring memo for future episodes. But now that it's written, I've decided to post it instead. And maybe..hopefully.. my shared experience might ease the burden of another bipolar soul in need.

And now off I go to heed my own advice and have a good long sleep. Here's hoping tomorrow is a better day :)",t2_5252vqk1,False,,0,False,When the depression hits hard..

,bipolar,"The last few days have been Christmas celebrations for me and it me realize that I really don't like my family. My parents are divorced (and my dad's absent) so for the first time in the years since covid I really saw my dad around Christmas time. My stepmom invited me to her family’s Christmas celebration and I thought it would be fun so I went. I talked to people and most importantly I talked to my stepbrother—who I haven't really talked to in years—about my bipolar. He was so nice and understanding but not in a fake way, he was just honest. The rest of her family was also so nice and just spoke to me like I was a part of their family. And they spoke to each other nicely as well, and not in a fake nice way just nice. And when they poked fun at each other it just felt like jokes. It was nice.

Then I went to my real mom’s family’s Christmas. It was horrible. Half the people didn't get anyone anything and everyone was kinda just mean like they always are. Some things specifically were said that made me feel shitty—like literally about me—and it kinda ruined my mood for the night. The next day at home was like every single day: Everyone was angry and rude and making me feel horrible for just existing or just ignoring each other.

,bipolar,"So, I'm feeling desire for ""bad"" things. Like things I limit myself or have limits on. Because I view them as negative or that they could be detrimental to me. 

For example, I've never had a cigarette in my life, don't want to start, have sworn them off because everyone growing up chain smoked and it disgusts me. But the last few weeks I've had the thought EVERY time I go to a gas station ""maybe I should buy some cigarettes or a vape"" and I feel ashamed immediately after. Today, I wanted to buy scratch offs. Which I know aren't as bad and every year or two I will buy some, but I try not to. And there's tons of other things I desire or am slightly giving in to that aren't as ""good"" for me. Like super horny and taking risks with that. But the cigarettes and scratch offs are new thoughts. 

I'm doing good things more, too, though. Like, I've started working out a little more. I'm drinking less (at home at least). Doing more crafts, I'm finally practicing makeup and hair stuff again. I got a water drinking app that's been helping. Like still doing good things and keeping pretty consistent the last few weeks. 

But it's like my brain wants to just break every rule I have and undo any good stuff and do all these ""bad"" things. It's so frustrating. I've worked really hard my whole life to try to control, try to maintain at least decent health if no energy for really good. But like, why all of a sudden am I constantly itching for these random things? I'm feeling a bit depressed and lonely and lost lately, but am still going out and hanging and talking to friends.

These impulsive/intrusive thoughts just itch at the back of my mind. I don't know what to do or how I should feel about myself. I've also had a lot of suicidal thoughts that I've been managing so I'm wondering if maybe this is my brain trying to still self destruct because I'm not doing that. It's just making it hard to take preventive action to keep myself in a good place.

I&amp;#39;ve worked really hard my whole life to try to control, try to maintain at least decent health if no energy for really good. But like, why all of a sudden am I constantly itching for these random things? I&amp;#39;m feeling a bit depressed and lonely and lost lately, but am still going out and hanging and talking to friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These impulsive/intrusive thoughts just itch at the back of my mind. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do or how I should feel about myself. I&amp;#39;ve also had a lot of suicidal thoughts that I&amp;#39;ve been managing so I&amp;#39;m wondering if maybe this is my brain trying to still self destruct because I&amp;#39;m not doing that. It&amp;#39;s just making it hard to take preventive action to keep myself in a good place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to go ahead and get ahead of comments. I&amp;#39;m on meds. I&amp;#39;m in therapy. Looking to get advice that isn&amp;#39;t just &amp;quot;meds and therapy!&amp;quot; TY!&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"hello, this is my first time posting here. i (22F) was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2 which honestly has been really hard for me to accept. i haven't taken medication out of fears of 1) weight-gain (i have an ED) and 2) that i'm not actually bipolar. 

my mom (57F) and i do not get along. i see myself as a very level-headed person, while she just seems outright delusional most of the time. she always yelled at me over random unimportant things as a child. insults my appearance a lot, and overall was always hostile while I was growing up. this has caused me to resent her a lot, which is hard for me to admit. I am very irritable and rude toward her, but i'm not quite sure if the irritability is a bipolar thing or if its just because i simply do not like her. 

today, we had a huge fight. she called me out for being rude all the time, and i ended up just telling her straight-up that i resented her and listed all the things that made me resent her over the years. she denied all of it and said i was making things up, which i am not. she started crying because she couldn't handle my brutal honesty.

however, no matter how many times i try to communicate how she has made me feel, she always denies it. straight up tries to gaslight me into thinking she's never done anything wrong. but every hour she screams about something, complains, yells, freaks out over nothing. it's exhausting.

so later today, she sends me a huge text basically saying that i need to start taking meds for my bipolar because it's making me irritable and that i'm ""making mountains out of mole hills,"" which she also attributes to BD. **but honestly, i feel like she is using my recent diagnosis to dismiss my feelings and words to make her feel better about herself.** 

so i guess my question is this: **how do you differentiate between genuine emotions vs bipolar irritation/paranoia?** i know i am not paranoid about the way she has treated me because my non-BD siblings feel the same way as me about the things she has done. i feel like i'm going crazy because i feel like my emotions are not irrational considering her words and actions toward me, but her dismissal of my emotions because of my recent diagnosis is making me second guess myself. what's real and what isn't? it's all just very confusing :( any advice?
