Petrie just telepathically said to me ""mom, make the voices stop"" and I was immediately completely freaked out and horrified and tried to communicate back with him but everything from then on was garbled in my brain. Then the voices started to tell me things like ""we're poisoning Petrie's mind"" and ""Petrie is ours now"" and ""you don't want to know what we're doing to Otter"" so I don't know if Otter is hearing them too or if they're doing something else horrible to her. I'm devastated and in a state of complete shock and horror and misery right now. I had one job, to protect my babies, and I failed at it and now they're suffering like I suffer. I should have known something was wrong because they've been acting strangely the past few days, meowing a lot more than normal and eating less than normal and sitting where they don't normally sit and wandering around a lot more than they usually do. 

I don't know what to do. I messaged my boyfriend and he said they're fine but couldn't give any reasoning for it, then tried calling my mom but it went straight to voicemail, probably because my parents are on the road down to see my extended family for Christmas right now (which doesn't help matters, because the voices have been saying for days that the CIA is going to orchestrate a car crash on the way that kills them). I just want to curl up in a ball with my poor kitties and cry and hold them tight and tell them not to listen to the evil voices. 

What makes things even worse is that my cats are both microchipped, like I have a microchip in my brain, and the government could be using their microchips to control them as they use mine to control me.

,schizophrenia,"Just want to drop some lines for today is Christmas.

So many of you now sit in a dark place and feel all lost and cast out. Others have a good time today, and we all sit there with the madness or the memories of. It can feel a lot like being discarded and rejected for the pains one has to bear. Like being punished twice for something that wasn't one's fault to begin with.

Well, I just want to tell you all today, don't give yourself up because of that. Don't let people belittle or disregard you because of the experiences you had. These experiences are all valid experiences. They are tough hardship, and even when other people can't see it we all struggle with this hidden suffering and have to get by.

We are all valid survivors of that hardship. We can be proud of getting through that and still being alive. People just have a hard time to recognize - if we were paralyzed, had lost a limb or sight or hearing, then people could recognize our hardship. The hardship we have in the mind they can't see. Some people fail to understand our situations completely, or just fear it too much, others follow an instinct to account the suffering to our persons, and this can really hurt and make one feel alone and lost with the suffering at times.

That's why we have to make up our hearts and realize and accept that this suffering is not visible but still there and valid. This is why people with experience need to stick together and raise awareness. Overcoming barriers of silence and working for the recognition of our pains. Many people already recognize, and understand that we are valid in our struggles. The experiences we have to make...they are the most humbling you can have, the most agonizing, also hard to see from the outside. And this is what makes us especially valid, because nothing makes you tougher and wiser in the end than what we have to go through.

So I want you to take this now into tonight, and try to make it a good night somehow even when others can't see that validity. You know in your heart you're valid and what you've gone through, you know you deserve all respect for that hardship. When others can't see it right, then you have to admit that to yourself.

Even when you're in a dark place, I hope you will not lose trust in life and keep working your way ahead. You know, you don't need to be the uberman to do that. You just need to be open minded and on the look for the chances you have in your life, and then step by step by step making these things real. And it's all there, this world may seem dark at times but the beginnings for trying to make it better are everywhere around us. We just have to look into our heart, around us, and listen to those who bring us the awareness of what we can do to make the best out of our lives still in our bad situation.

You know, there are often things in the way to that. The worst enemy to getting better I found is the thought of expectations that others and the world seems to have from people like us like from everyone. These expectations together with the silence about our pains are what can make us feel so dark at times, with the feeling we could never meet the standards we have to think of. Try to think differently today - we are not in this world, to live up to anyone's expectations, neither the others are there to live up to ours.

We are not really obliged to anything by our heart other than trying to get happy and lucky however we can. Noble is then, when you not only seek your own happiness, but also that of others and take the responsibility for it. This is probably everything our nature truly obliges us to, that's the freedom to follow our heart and learn from wherever it takes us. This is the point, when you realize after dropping some of the expectations you feel pressing you down, that you still can do a lot and follow your dreams and the good things from the present and past you find in your heart. It's all there for us, and whatever we do out of it will be a valid experience, no matter what other people say about it, no matter how many voices are dragging us down. The heart can and will still spark up these dreams for us to take up and follow, and I found, when we take our time and really follow them from heart, they can be stronger than the delusions, they can make us overcome them and reconnect to other people and still find fulfillment in our lives even when we thought all our previous dreams were broken down to shards. This is not just some empty words, but my own experience from more than 20 years with the diagnosis.

So, I hope these words can take some load of someone's chest tonight, and make you feel a little better about the situation. I know this situation can be very bad, but you're not alone with it, and when you just keep going and looking for new beginning you can maybe also find some threads to pick up and weave a new life out of it. It's Christmas today, so do something good for yourself and if you can and dare, also for another one, to bring back some hopes for a new beginning in the next year.

So I wish you all a merry Christmas, or a merry non-Christmas if you chose to reject the santa merchandise...hell, it's your right to do so, to celebrate or not, and it's still special days that you can use to give yourself some space for your heart. Hope you have people around you who make you feel valid, and if you're alone, I wrote this to tell you you're valid nonetheless!",t2_e4d8zb9y,False,,0,False,Schizophrenia is a valid experience,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18pvdtf,False,light,0.91,#0dd3bb,public,18,0,{},,cc4fb44c-b658-11eb-8a8b-0e5d4c19d3b3,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice / Encouragement,False,18,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1703425035.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just want to drop some lines for today is Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many of you now sit in a dark place and feel all lost and cast out. Others have a good time today, and we all sit there with the madness or the memories of. It can feel a lot like being discarded and rejected for the pains one has to bear. Like being punished twice for something that wasn&amp;#39;t one&amp;#39;s fault to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I just want to tell you all today, don&amp;#39;t give yourself up because of that. Don&amp;#39;t let people belittle or disregard you because of the experiences you had. These experiences are all valid experiences. They are tough hardship, and even when other people can&amp;#39;t see it we all struggle with this hidden suffering and have to get by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all valid survivors of that hardship. We can be proud of getting through that and still being alive. People just have a hard time to recognize - if we were paralyzed, had lost a limb or sight or hearing, then people could recognize our hardship. The hardship we have in the mind they can&amp;#39;t see. Some people fail to understand our situations completely, or just fear it too much, others follow an instinct to account the suffering to our persons, and this can really hurt and make one feel alone and lost with the suffering at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why we have to make up our hearts and realize and accept that this suffering is not visible but still there and valid. This is why people with experience need to stick together and raise awareness. Overcoming barriers of silence and working for the recognition of our pains. Many people already recognize, and understand that we are valid in our struggles. The experiences we have to make...they are the most humbling you can have, the most agonizing, also hard to see from the outside. And this is what makes us especially valid, because nothing makes you tougher and wiser in the end than what we have to go through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I want you to take this now into tonight, and try to make it a good night somehow even when others can&amp;#39;t see that validity. You know in your heart you&amp;#39;re valid and what you&amp;#39;ve gone through, you know you deserve all respect for that hardship. When others can&amp;#39;t see it right, then you have to admit that to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when you&amp;#39;re in a dark place, I hope you will not lose trust in life and keep working your way ahead. You know, you don&amp;#39;t need to be the uberman to do that. You just need to be open minded and on the look for the chances you have in your life, and then step by step by step making these things real.

I'll try keep this short. I have a younger brother who has just come out of a PICU ward and onto a transition ward.

He was expressing symptoms of severe psychosis and mania.

While psychotic he said he was getting thoughts about killing my mum and family.

He's now been medicated and has got day leave from the hospital.

His behaviour is still unnerving towards me, sometimes he'll be speaking coherently and then all of a sudden he'll blank stare at me really intensely.

When this happens I don't know how to react as it feels very uncomfortable. Is this typical behaviour for someone who has just been put on anti psychotics? He was doing this but more intense when he wasn't on medication.

I really hope that younger generations with these kinds of mental health issues are finding it easier to navigate our systems and structures and are able to create meaningful lives for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

 I am non-binary and diagnosed schizophrenic. I feel very certain that I am non-binary, but I just can’t seem to come out to people and insist on my identity. The reasons follow:

 I often feel like I don’t exist. Both in terms of not “representing myself”(?), but also like I *really* am invisible or dead already or just not here or between worlds/dimensions.

,schizophrenia,"      I (15)F was just recently diagnosed with schizophrenia. I have a feeling a lot of people are going to say I'm to young to get the diagnosis, but at this point I'm not even in early stages, I have the symptoms of someone who would have had it for years now. And no obviously it didn't happen over night.
      I've been full on panicking since I got the diagnosis, I feel the hallucinations and delusions have gotten worse bc I can't stop thinking about it. A year of doctors appointments, so many diagnosis. I prepared myself for all the possibilities. When schizophrenia crossed my mind, I didn't really read too much into it. A lot of my problems were blamed on other illnesses and childhood .
     My family sucks at keeping theses things to themselves especially if they could get the attention from other people. Too many people already know. Right now I'm doing online school, but I start public school again in 11ish days. I don't know who I'm supposed to tell or if some students are going to have to know in case I have a episode. I don't want other people to hear and think I'm crazy. I'm not crazy.
      This next part is going to really show the schizophrenia in me, but I'm scared. What if I'm the only real one and I'm in a simulation. And the goal is to not let people take other me. If I get on the medication it will shift my mind. I think the government knows I know too much. I've finally figured out what they've been doing. Or what if I'm not real and everyone else is. Maybe I'm a clone. I am a remake of somebody else who died. Is my brain my own??
      I have so many superstitions. I really do think I know to much and I don't know who to trust. Nothing feels real anymore. I know I haven't always been like this but I can't remember what it was like when I wasn't. Why can't I be normal. Why do I have to be the one to fight against the government. 
      Honestly at this point it's making me want to relapse on self harm or suicide. I just want to feel real. And if I am schizophrenic, I know I will be put into an institution eventually, and I don't want to go to places like that anymore. 
      If you've read my last posts, I've been in mental hospitals bc they were trying to see why I was the way I am.
      This is really hard to accept because I've had big dreams and everything is going down hill. Do any of you have schizophrenia or help people who do? I really need some advice and maybe just some details on what my life could look like from now.

  Honestly at this point it&amp;#39;s making me want to relapse on self harm or suicide. I just want to feel real. And if I am schizophrenic, I know I will be put into an institution eventually, and I don&amp;#39;t want to go to places like that anymore. 
  If you&amp;#39;ve read my last posts, I&amp;#39;ve been in mental hospitals bc they were trying to see why I was the way I am.
  This is really hard to accept because I&amp;#39;ve had big dreams and everything is going down hill. Do any of you have schizophrenia or help people who do? I really need some advice and maybe just some details on what my life could look like from now.
  Thank you so much
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

,schizophrenia,"I've been diagnosed with psychosis but I don't know if it's full-blown schizophrenia or a schizoaffective disorder.

I'll try to keep it short. I think there are cameras in my wall and I think I saw a lense once. I'm scares of mirrors and they must be avoided or faced away from me if possible. I think people are always watching me. Always following me. When I hear laughing, it's about me. The government knows I have powers. I am a god, an alien, or an angel. I think everything has a meaning and an constantly trying to decipher it. Back in 2021-2022, I became obsessed with spirit numbers, 111 and 333 and 222 and so on. I would hallucinate these numbers. I would see blobs of color and messages in the air. They were meant for me. I'd also see random words and numbers. I see shadow faces and sparkles of white. I have visual snow syndrome though, so it could be that.

I have horrible mood swings. I sleep for 11-14 hours each night. I've been irritable my whole life but it's getting worse. I'm so on edge. My therapist said I have stress and anxiety that is so bad, my body has normalized it to the point where I can't discern it. I used to have false memories and extremely vivid dreams that I thought were memories. I had severe ocd and would wear multiple layers of gloves, wash my hands until they bled, and when it was really bad, I couldn't breathe a certain way or wouldn't touch a certain part of my bedframe while I slept. I would apologize to God and sob over the Bible. I'd force myself to smile. I'd pour bleach on my skin. I'd shower for hours. Laundry became a 5-hour process because I had to move clothes a certain way. It was hell.

Along with ocd, I've also been diagnosed with autism, schizoid pd, depression, anxiety, panic attack disorder, and we suspect I have ADHD.

Mentally, I feel like a child. I was born into a household that was a quiet type of abusive. I thought it was fine, but my adolescence was horrible. My parents were strict and gave me trauma that I suppressed.

Now my memory is bad. I forget things after a few seconds and I take it to mean my brain is trying to protect me by rejecting unnecessary information.

Right now, I have a hard time socializing. I can't speak right. I stutter and say the wrong words. I can't type right. I'm a writer but my hands will sometimes type the wrong thing that my brain thinks.

I don't know. Is this schizophrenia? I've been through 8 therapists and they say it's severe anxiety mixed with autism and ocd. I'm planning to meet with my psychiatrist soon to discuss meds. I'm on Zoloft and Abilify bit it's not helping. I've tried so many meds.

I've never taken drugs, so this is likely stress-related. Is it schizophrenia? It's really ruining my life. And would anyone recommend some coping strategies? Please don't say meditation. It's too hard for me.

TRIGGER WARNING: these paragraphs contain suicide and self harm

My aunt (40F) used to be such a happy person. She loved hanging out with me and we used to have so much fun together.

She’s getting worse. When she was just diagnosed with schizophrenia she couldn’t really talk to me she was just kinda staring into space.

She has a voice in her head and the voice in her head is Jesus. Jesus tells her that she is in a relationship with him. 

She tried to break up with her husband because she doesn’t want to be unloyal to Jesus. She has committed the 1st suicide attempt by an overdose to be with Jesus. When it didn’t work she was set to hospital and I saw her face it was completely purple. When it didn’t work she tried cutting herself and trying to hit a major artery

She tells me and my family who’s going to heaven and hell because Jesus has told her, apparently I’m going to heaven and her parents are going to hell.

She has tried to commit suicide once again and she got sent to a mental hospital which she has escaped multiple times and ran out bare foot. 

I just hate to see her struggling and my cousins are her children, I feel really bad for them to see their mother in such a bad way.

So my aunt can’t spend Christmas with her family and I just feel so awful for her. I know it’s for a good reason tho.

I just needed to get this out because I’ve been crying so much because I care about her as she’s cared about my many years, we used to be so close and she’s not herself anymore she used to be so bubbly and happy and o went to visit her and she’s as skinny as anything she looks so poorly ",t2_lw5gltnb4,False,,0,False,My aunt has schizophrenia and she’s really getting worse,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18p8hgf,False,light,1.0,,public,13,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger Warning,False,13,,False,False,,1703355213.0,,[],{},,True,,1703346709.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is more a vent because I’m really worried about her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And instead live in reality, work on my safety needs (money and health), and build genuine relationships with real people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any thoughts let me know. I would love to hear some perspectives. Did you have any to decide on anything? I really want to move on in life.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hey everyone, I just made this account to ask a question that’s been on my mind that my psych hasn’t helped me address yet. I looked over the about section and FAQs so I hope I didn’t miss anything that would violate the guidelines! I am also on the mobile site so I apologize for any weird formatting errors.

To start, I am not diagnosed with schizophrenia but I am diagnosed bipolar and harm-type OCD. I am on two different medications to treat these respective diagnoses, but my OCD meds are anti-psychotics that are very rarely ever prescribed for OCD and are more common for schizophrenia and symptoms that relate to such. These meds do help, but I think my psych is a bit lost on “what” I might actually be. 

The reason I say this is because I experience (what I think are) delusions, although my descriptions of such might sound more like hallucinations. (Trigger Warning Ahead) It starts when I become very paranoid that there are bugs in my walls (a big OCD trigger for me) and devolves into me “seeing” the walls moving or pulsating to the motions of the bugs or “hearing” the bugs moving in them. The reason for the quotes is because I’m not sure that I “see” or “hear” these as much as I sort of feel them doing that, if that makes sense. Once I hit this stage, I can either stay in that paranoid/delusional state or it can worsen and I become much more paranoid about other things— like people following me, trying to hurt me, or that bugs have now spread to anything I touch. Basically I don’t feel safe anywhere, even my feet touching the ground or any surface makes me want to vomit or scream, and I don’t trust anyone around me, even my partner who I very much love. 

I guess I’m just wondering how you can tell the difference between hallucinations and delusions? I think I do “see” or “hear” things, but I’ve heard people who are diagnosed with schizophrenia describe auditory or visual hallucinations and they seem much more intense than what I experience. 

I know this is a general question but any insight would be super appreciated, especially because I’m kind of anxious about talking to my psych more deeply about it. Usually when I bring it up, she opts to up my meds and the conversation ends there.

,schizophrenia,"Does anyone else here find the mornings the most difficult part of the day? 

I used to love mornings but lately they're quite challenging. 

I think it might be because my night-time Risperidone has worn off and my morning dose needs a bit of time to kick in, but I always find the first few hours of the day the hardest. It mostly seems to be my energy levels that are affected, I just feel slow and dead in the mornings, but I also feel more anxious and sometimes a little paranoid depending on the day. 

It almost feels like each day I have a mountain to climb, I start off the mountain feeling crappy, then over the first couple of hours of the day I climb up to alright, then by hour 4-5 or so I'm feeling decent, and on good days by hour 7-9 I'll be feeling *good*. Once I'm there I usually stay there for the rest of the day until something happens to throw off my mood, which means every night I'm always dreading going to sleep, because in the night I'm feeling pretty good usually, but at the same time I know the good feeling I have will be gone again in the morning and I'll have to make the climb again.

It's one of the reasons I'm struggling to give up smoking again because in the past I started off weaning off the cigarettes by delaying my morning cigarette as long as possible - but recently my mornings have been rough and those first couple of cigarettes feel like the one thing getting me through it.

,schizophrenia,"hi all,

i’m a fictional author and always trying to include diverse representation in my books. my current work-in-progress is a romance told from the POV of the female main character who falls for the male main character who has schizophrenia. The book is not about the MMC’s schizophrenia, but it is a rather small subplot which i want to be as accurate as possible.

I’ve read through this subreddit a LOT and I have a few unanswered questions:

For those of you that are medicated/in therapy, what are your day to day “symptoms” (forgive me if this is poor terminology)?

Those of you in relationships, what are the best ways your partners have supported you? (Or ways that partners made things harder for you?)

&amp; any other advice I should know? (i.e. poor representations you’ve seen before/things I should avoid?) 

I appreciate this greatly. I can read all day in the DSM-5 or in research journals, but nothing is better than advice straight from the very people I’m attempting to represent. 

To those who reply, if the book gets published (I’m optimistic that it will, but in traditional publishing you never really know), any comments that I utilize in creating this story will get a PM upon completion &amp; I’ll send you a free copy of the novel :)))

Thanks, friends.

,schizophrenia,"Hello,

I don’t know if I have this post tagged right, I apologize if it’s not.  I have some questions and I could really use some advice from people who have experience.

My partner recently had a pretty severe psychotic episode with delusions and hallucinations that landed him in the hospital.  We previously thought he had bipolar disorder, but the doctors thought otherwise after what they observed.  He was communicating to aliens, god, getting messages from tv shows, among other things.  He claimed he was channeling aliens, angels, demons.  Yelling in loud voices and shaking around, laughing hysterically at random points.  Then he’d just stare and not respond, occasionally shaking his head or nodding, chuckling — he was communicating with them, he said.  He’d go through periods of really intense negative emotion, happiness, and no emotion — according to him.  At one point he said he was channeling my spirit that was a demon trying to turn into an angel.  Eventually it subsided to a point that was less outwardly visible, but says the aliens/angels are testing him and making him a better person.  They told him not to lie and are making him tell me things that he has been lying to me about for like over 10 years.  I don’t want to go into details, but I’m reeling because I remember the incidents he’s telling me and remember thinking he was lying to me at the time.  I feel sick and feel like I’m in shock.

My question is, I guess — is it possible for his delusions to cause him to become more honest, like compulsively almost, because he says they’re making him a better person and making him tell the truth?  I’m so confused right now.  And the mood swings and staring off into the distance and not responding are scaring me.

He has an appointment with his psychiatrist soon.  He still doesn’t know what’s going on and I don’t think he can really consider that he could be sick.  I’m not sure how to help him right now.  I have a mental illness myself and I feel like I’m losing my sanity.

I’m not judging him, I realize this is rough.  I feel so bad for him.  :(

,schizophrenia,"Hi guys,  


I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia 6/7 years ago, I had awful delusions and hallucations, I didn't know what was real and what wasn't, my whole personality changed to try and face the new 'reality' that I was living in. However, with a combination of CBT, Ariprazole, Risperidone and Quetiapine (Not al at once, jesus) I managed to crawl my way out of the delusions, and the hallucinations without the delusions are an irritant at worst.  


But I'm still struggling with the negative symptoms 4/5 years later, I thought the emotional issues were potentially a defence mechanism that my brain would eventually repair, but they're still occuring.   


Let me describe what I'm experiencing now:

  
\- Incredibly low ""social battery"", after 30-60 minutes of conversation, my social battery feels completely empty, I can't think of things to say, I can't join in on any jokes, I pretty much go completely non-verbal for 30 minutes until I recharge, in a group this is fine, but 1 on 1 it makes for pretty awkward situations  


\- Emotional blunting/severe apathy, unless I'm intoxicated, I don't feel any emotion towards what people say or do, I don't get defensive, I don't get upset, I don't get offended, I don't find things funny, I don't express gratitude or love properly, I don't express concern etc. Outwardly I can still express these emotions in pantomine, but some people see straight through me and I can come across as fake or ingenuine. Before the schizophrenia I was a very emotionally intelligent and outwardly displaying person, but now I feel like a borderline psychopath emotionally.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sleep issues, I have never been able to sleep correctly, and can only sleep when I'm on brink of passing out from exhaustion. I've managed to get a 12-8 shift at my 9-5 to allow me to fall asleep at 4/5am without major consequence, but I would like to get some insight on this, and see if it's a result of the negative symptoms or just a personal thing, as I've had trouble with sleep ever since I was a child  


I would be interested to know if anybody has faced these same negative symptoms, and potential solutions to properly mitigate them. The fact that I tend to be okay emotionally when I'm intoxicated makes me think there's some sort of psychological block there, but on the other hand, the increased confidence could just improve my self deception. Either way, this tends to make me use alcohol and substances as a crutch when socialising, which I could do without.

,schizophrenia,"Hello,

My wife has noticed I have good and bad cycles. Ups and Downs. During the downs I’m very withdrawn, inward, and suspicious. During the ups I’m just pretty normal. 

She’s noticed some signs about to have a down. I thought this was interesting and just wanted to share.

1) I’ll get very opinionated and argumentative 

2) I stop really focusing on the current and new and focus more on like existing I guess? Idk she said I get really philosophical and interested in the way the universe is swirling around me and like brushing my teeth. 

3) I either stop eating as much or eat way more. During an up I’ll eat pretty healthy and a lot of different things. When I’m down I eat more hearty comfort meals and nostalgic things that remind me of my childhood.

4) I will do things that bring me a lot of comfort. I’ll start the harry potter series over or lord of the rings. When I’m good I’ll seek out new books.

5) I’ll get really religious when I’m starting to decline too.

,schizophrenia,"I want to preface by saying I currently see a psychiatrist for different things (ASD,ADHD,GAD and MDD). I also have background knowledge in the topic. 

I will also preface, I am NOT looking for a diagnosis or expecting a “magic answer” I’m just looking to compare experiences , familiarities, hear stories etc , to better make sense of my situation. 

Post: 


For the last 6-12 months I have been having lingering depression, which as per my MDD and ASD is not a foreign concept. However this recent period of depression has been without the normal mood components, no suicidal ideation no loss of self worth etc, they are all anhedonia, lethargy and poor self care related + executive dysfunction. I’ve been distancing myself and not wanting any interactions apart from necessary ones (not bizarre given my Autism but it’s more frequent, also could just be burnout).. 

During this time my anxiety has been playing up, when I go to the gym I am paranoid everyone is looking at me and talking about me, staring at me and laughing at me. 

This also happens at work , where I think people are laughing at me, communicating between eachother non verbally and don’t like me. 

At times I also periodically get paranoid my neighbours can see me showering and I sometimes hear noises resembling that thought (window opening, lock noise or a laugh). (Rarely). 

I also get anxious about my air con vent that someone is looking through it (however this was prominent in my teens and was severe so I slept under the blanket for months). 

I have also been noticing more visual illusions, by this I mean in my peripheral vision I sometimes see objects that will periodically take a shape of a person until I look at them centrally and it’s normal. Or sometimes I’ll see floating dots around. (My vision and eye health is fine as per the optometrist) Sometimes I get paranoid I may have seen a human figure too until I look at “them” and it’s nothing or a door for example. (These have been getting more frequent, I’m aware illusions are normal but with their increasing frequency and “severity”)..  they also sometimes take the form of just being shadow spots or a sensation someone has walked behind me.

When walking to my car at night I sometimes get paranoid I’m being followed and sometimes think I hear foot steps following me (assuming this could be an anxiety response). 

Very recently I’ve started laughing out loud to thoughts that come into my head, and sometimes my thoughts just don’t make sense, the other day I made a joke in my mind I was the beacon of truth- that made me laugh out loud lol. (This could also be a self soothing thing with my ASD). 

Further , I’ve been having increasing Deja vu , like every day sometimes multiple times a day. Like a situation or string of words was something that happened before , and preceded a bad event or something bad happening. Almost like a sense of doom but mild.

How was everyone else’s prodrome? Any comparisons/similarities? 

I am aware these symptoms could also overlap with burnout from my ASD, anxiety exacerbating these concerns and my depression being in the background. (? MDD with psychotic features etc). 

I was intrigued at Schizophrenia due to reading a few study’s of the slightly increased % of ASD people in likelihood to develop schizophrenia.

&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a mental illness I live with, but it is not who I am. I define myself through my own actions and realize I can’t be perfect all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel what I feel, see what I hear. Gruesome thoughts horrific sounds, none of this will weigh me down. King in my mind is what I need to find, give me a sign of the divine and free my soul ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"I don't necessarily mean naming the individual voices (although by all means, feel free to share). I have come to learn that saying you ""hear voices"" can be off-putting to people, so I was thinking of giving mine a nickname. Something like the Peanut Gallery, or my passengers, backseat drivers, haters, fan club, etc.

Idk, it just seems like there's a stigma against people who hear voices and sometimes I want to talk to others about it without them being uncomfortable and not knowing how to respond.

There have also been times when I've said things to friends or family about severe hallucinations and delusions I was experiencing that are uncomfortable and serious topics, the nature of which makes it difficult to explain or open up about.

My thoughts was that it would be easier to talk about if I didn't use such ""scary"" language, and to talk about my experiences in a way that makes it easier to empathize with.

So how do you talk about it, and does that help? Also, for those of you who communicate with your voices, how does the way you refer to and treat them help you manage them and cope with what they're saying?

For example, when the voices become overwhelmingly difficult to ignore, I tend to go full mockery mode and make fun of my loudmouths any way I can think of. Sometimes it riles them up and they'll get frustrated, other times they're very insistent on telling me whatever they think will upset me the most. 

Having to manage my voices has become incredibly disruptive to my life, and I'm struggling to even do that when I live in isolation, no one to speak with about it whatsoever (even when I was briefly seeing a therapist, since i never got to talk about it). And that isn't even to mention the fact that I also hear persecutory voices when I see people in public, every time I pass someone by or turn away from them. Still don't know how to deal with that other than confront them and ask them to repeat what they just said (which is obviously the wrong thing to do about it).

,schizophrenia,"  

A pair of twins were brought up in a Christian home where it was strongly recommended to respect the law and stay away from smoking, drinking alcohol and doing drugs.

Both were brough up blessed having parents that could provide them with necessities and some luxuries. They both went to a private high school. They played hockey for about 7 years, they did triathlons, swimming competitions, passed their alpine skiing instructor class, and were lifeguards on a pool.

The older brother did a good job of complying reasonably with their parents’ recommendations, however the younger one didn’t. The older brother obtained two bachelor’s degrees, a master’s degree and went on to live the American Dream. With wealth, health and fitness, he went on to achieve many accomplishments and obtained good fortune.

The younger brother who didn’t obey his parents consumed recreational drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol abundantly, quit school, developed paranoid schizophrenia, and lived close to a decade on welfare.

The older brother achieved the steps on the track to the American Dream pretty much in a straight, orderly and legal line, while the younger one, as he developed the illness, wandered off the track, explored the unknown and pranced around in off-road fields doing things that were not understood and that were considered as a waste of time.

One day, the younger twin asked for divine intervention at the right place. The same year, he was prescribed efficient medication. One year later, he had a minimum wage part-time job. Two years later, he had a diploma and a full-time job. Four years after that, he had a wife, a car and a condo. Today he is happily married, homeowner and on his way in his 11th year working full-time at a stable job.

To those of you who don’t believe in God, what do you make of this?

&lt;p&gt;Both were brough up blessed having parents that could provide them with necessities and some luxuries. They both went to a private high school. They played hockey for about 7 years, they did triathlons, swimming competitions, passed their alpine skiing instructor class, and were lifeguards on a pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The older brother did a good job of complying reasonably with their parents’ recommendations, however the younger one didn’t. The older brother obtained two bachelor’s degrees, a master’s degree and went on to live the American Dream. With wealth, health and fitness, he went on to achieve many accomplishments and obtained good fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The younger brother who didn’t obey his parents consumed recreational drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol abundantly, quit school, developed paranoid schizophrenia, and lived close to a decade on welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The older brother achieved the steps on the track to the American Dream pretty much in a straight, orderly and legal line, while the younger one, as he developed the illness, wandered off the track, explored the unknown and pranced around in off-road fields doing things that were not understood and that were considered as a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, the younger twin asked for divine intervention at the right place. The same year, he was prescribed efficient medication. One year later, he had a minimum wage part-time job. Two years later, he had a diploma and a full-time job. Four years after that, he had a wife, a car and a condo. Today he is happily married, homeowner and on his way in his 11th year working full-time at a stable job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To those of you who don’t believe in God, what do you make of this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m doing better since I&amp;#39;ve been out of work, but I&amp;#39;m still hella anxious. My symptoms have gotten better after switching to Abilify, but my meds make me dizzy and sick, so I&amp;#39;m afraid my doctor might want to switch meds again. Switching medications is always scary for me. I&amp;#39;ve ended up hospitalized during a med change. It&amp;#39;s not something I want to go through again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find doing things like showering, getting dressed, etc are becoming harder to do. I&amp;#39;m so upset all the time and I hate it. I need to pull myself out of this downward spiral. I&amp;#39;m doing all the things..going to therapy classes..taking my meds..keeping up with appointments.. I&amp;#39;m so good at masking. I&amp;#39;m afraid to tell my friends and family the truth about how hopeless I feel and how I&amp;#39;m passively suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"I (30F) and my boyfriend (41M) have been having problems in our relationship. We will refer to my boyfriend as Peter from now on. We have been together for the past 2 years and a half. Peter is a very sensitive and empathetic person and I love him a lot but he is severely burnt out mentally. He is the main caregiver along with his aging mother for his schizophrenic brother (30M), let’s call him Tom. My boyfriend lives to take care of Tom financially and emotionally, he says this is main duty in life. Anything that Tom needs Peter does not hesitate to get as he loves his brother deeply and just wants him to have a normal as possible life. Tom is very functional meaning he can complete everyday tasks but lacks awareness that he suffers from schizophrenia. He has been to the psychiatrist and yet still does not believe the diagnosis, does not acknowledge this and thus does not take his anti-psychotic medication. Peter has resorted to putting his medication in his food to control his symptoms which he feels very conflicted and horrible about. This diagnosis was a few years ago. Tom stays at home all day because he does not work, he did not complete his bachelor’s degree as he suffered a psychotic break and was unable to study, thus he spends a lot of time at home on the internet and he smokes around 2 packs of cigarettes per day. He also smokes cannabis which intensifies his behavior where he gets in negative moods and his negative delusions increase. Tom has a lot of delusions of unrealistic ideas e.g. he says he is a therapist and him talking to people means that he has had experience in therapy thus he is a therapist and he has also created an Only Fans in a manic state and does not remember doing so and posting explicit pictures.

Peter is emotionally burnt out as he spends a lot of time talking to his brother trying to reason with him which can go on for hours every day about all his ideas and things he wants to do or courses he wants to pursue. Tom also has a habit of pursuing courses he is unable to complete because he feels much unfilled that he did not complete his degree and is trying to compensate. My boyfriend in turn has to pay for these courses which are sometimes expensive and if he does not pay for it Tom becomes very agitated and unhappy. Peter has tried telling Tom multiple times about his diagnosis but he still refuses to acknowledge this and becomes very angry when this discussion is brought up.

Initially for around the 1st few months of Peter’s and I relationship, I used to spend a lot of time at his house and we would do normal couple things like watch movies, eat together or just spend time together in general. Peter was hesitant to introduce me to Tom initially but we also formed a good relationship. I spent a lot of time talking to Tom about different topics in general and his interests mostly, as he doesn’t have much interest in anything else besides what he wants to talk about. Tom however began to have a problem that I was spending more time with Peter than him. Tom and I are similar ages and he began to compare himself to me academically and financially. For reference Tom and I attended similar schools and we were both academically inclined. I completed my bachelor’s degree and began working soon after, I have a normal 9-5 and he has told Peter that I remind him of all the things he did not accomplish academically. He said that it was hard to be around me because I am a constant reminder of what he did not accomplish. I have never ever flaunted my academics or job and or acted in any way but Tom has built this his reality that I am a sore reminder that he is a failure and that he feels horrible around me. He has also commented on the age gap between Peter and me that it is weird that he and I are similar in ages and that Peter is so much older. Tom also began to have an issue with Peter and spending time together because that I should be talking to him instead. This also contradicts the part where he doesn’t want to be around me because my presence makes him feel less than but that I should talk to him more than Peter.

Eventually it reached a point where I had to stop coming to the house in order to not make Tom uncomfortable. Peter and I are still in a relationship but Tom does not know about it. Peter has told him I had to stop coming to the house because Tom indicated it made him uncomfortable and thus Tom believes we are not in a relationship anymore. It is sometimes stressful for both of us because Tom consistently asks Peter his whereabouts and is consistently checking up on him to see where he is. This in turn stresses Peter as he feels he is being deceitful and in turn it is difficult for me as we don’t spend time together. The most time we spend together is about 2 hours every week as we do not see each other on the weekdays during work as it’s more difficult for Peter to explain where he is.

This may seem strange from the outside looking in as Peter does not need to explain his decision but please bear in mind that Tom in mentally unwell and the way he views things is not through the same perspective as a so-called ‘normal person’. Peter is mostly at home with Tom so that Tom is not alone or has someone to talk to as Tom consistently needs to voice whatever is going on in his head. Tom does not have many friends he can talk to and has isolated himself from family as he also compares himself to family similar in age and what they have accomplished. I have voiced my opinion on what the future for Peter and I may hold as things don’t seem to be changing for the better. Also how is Peter going to explain this in a case we were to get married to Tom that we were still carrying on a relationship all this time? Also Peter has made it clear he has to live in the family home to take care of Tom so how would you explain this? It’s very difficult for Peter to be there for me emotionally as he is consistently worried about Tom and his sometimes unpredictable behavior as this has really worn him out after all these years. This has also affected his last relationship. I do not fault Peter as he is a wonderful guy but I don’t feel fulfilled or see things changing anything soon for us to spend more time as this is a serious issue that Peter cannot control. Any advice, I’m really hurting here as I would never want Peter to think I have abandoned him because of his situation, I try to support him as best as I can emotionally but it’s really taking a toll on me. Peter also suffers from severe depression because of the situation and burnout and I in turn have not been doing well mentally.

Also how is Peter going to explain this in a case we were to get married to Tom that we were still carrying on a relationship all this time? Also Peter has made it clear he has to live in the family home to take care of Tom so how would you explain this? It’s very difficult for Peter to be there for me emotionally as he is consistently worried about Tom and his sometimes unpredictable behavior as this has really worn him out after all these years. This has also affected his last relationship. I do not fault Peter as he is a wonderful guy but I don’t feel fulfilled or see things changing anything soon for us to spend more time as this is a serious issue that Peter cannot control. Any advice, I’m really hurting here as I would never want Peter to think I have abandoned him because of his situation, I try to support him as best as I can emotionally but it’s really taking a toll on me. Peter also suffers from severe depression because of the situation and burnout and I in turn have not been doing well mentally. Any thoughts or advice please.&lt;/p&gt;

He says he been watching deviant porn before being on meds years back, but it was exacerbated with smoking weed (which hes done for 2 years and stopped in 2013)
He got the abilify maintena injection (LAI) he felt clear headed the first 5 days with no porn cravings. However the cravings now have gradually resurfaced to his mind its day 6 now since the LAI. He feels clear headed with decent eye contact, a bit anxious of what he did yesterday. 
Abilify is a good medication but is the hypersexuality caused by the med or God forbids it’s just him. I am thinking of suggesting to switch to invega LAI that gets rid of the craving and ecstatic behavior on porn web, however it lowers the lobido (doesnt mind that) and you cant ejaculate semen while on it (so how is he going to create a family on it) makes him less dynamic in his thinking and he is slower when talking in his second language.

,schizophrenia,"Hi everyone, and thank you in advance for any advice.

I am in the US. My brother was hospitalized involuntarily on the 24th (Sunday). He is now on a 10 day hold. He will not take meds on his own, and is not med compliant in these scenarios. His symptoms are very severe right now, to the point where he is not able to recognize our parents. 

If they can get him stable enough to have a cohesive conversation I would love to tell him that if he is compliant he can at least choose what medication he is on, but if he continues to be noncompliant he will be forcibly medicated with whatever the doctor deems appropriate, with a long acting med. This has happened in the past.

He signed a HIPPA release for my mom to talk to the doctors (which is amazing considering he could not recognize her) so she may be able to say “please don’t give him X, try X instead.”

In the past he’s been given risperadone and more recently they put him on haldol, which he seemed ok on but very depressed although that’s unfortunately expected.

I’m wondering if someone is forcibly medicated if the schizophrenic community has any preferred vs. less preferred choices of the long acting meds. I wish he would comply because that way he can choose which meds to try and adjust the dose etc., but unfortunately that’s just not going to be the case in this instance.

TL:DR - if someone is going to be court ordered/forcibly medicated, what are the best choices and what should be avoided?

,schizophrenia,"tw: suicide


my beautiful boyfriend took his own life after his very intense battle with schizophrenia. he always struggled with mental illness but didn't start having delusions/psychotic episodes until this year. he was hospitalized twice and then a week after his second stay, he died. it was very gory and i never ever would have thought he would have taken his life in /that/ way.

i have a few questions about some of his delusions/just general things he did. i have tried so hard to educate myself on schizophrenia since his diagnosis and after his passing.

maybe it's more like describing things he did than they are questions.

-he was very much convinced that he was black/latino when in reality he was very white lol. he drove a black car and said that white cars were racist and that they hated him because he was in a black car

-he drove very erratically and eventually was no longer allowed to drive because he was constantly nearly getting us into accidents. he would weave in and out of vehicles, get over on top of them, speed, run lights, etc.

-he was obsessed with gang culture. he loved this movie called blood in blood out. talked about it all the time and seemed inspired by it.

-only listened to rap music (literally no problem but he has always been more of a post punk kinda guy)

-suddenly a born again catholic (he grew up baptist but always identified as agnostic). i know that those with schizophrenia can often become religious without any previous interest.

-always told me he could smell when i was ovulating. became obsessed with women's cycles.

-believed that swingers were out to get him and wanted to r*pe him.

there's probably so much more i never even witnessed. one time his friends took him to a movie and said that they heard him whispering to himself and then holding out the letter ""c"" with his hands and telling them it stood for comfort.

i asked him several times if he heard voices. i'm assuming he was lying when he told me no.

the last few days of his life he basically went nonverbal, could only pace my apartment, and was terrified someone was out to get him. i found out after taking him home to his mom's that he didn't take his meds the entire time he was in my home. i asked him every morning if he did and he lied. i feel so guilty and his family won't speak to me. i don't really know what i'm looking to achieve by posting here. maybe some insight? he was only 25. i miss him so, so much.

he didn't live with me and we saw each other few times a week. i had to drive two hours each way to bring him to my place and take him home or just spend time at his mom's.

he had no car, barely had a job, no friends in the area, had to move home and drop out of college. i can only imagine the pain and stress he was dealing with.",t2_2vmpuol3,False,,0,False,my boyfriend was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and died a month ago,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18roisc,False,light,0.98,,public,65,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger Warning,False,65,,False,False,,1703700933.0,,[],{},,True,,1703641602.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;tw: suicide&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"I (27F), want to start by saying I am not diagnosed as schizophrenic, I do not believe I am schizophrenic, and I am not looking to be arm chair diagnosed as schizophrenic.

I have OCD, ADHD and possibly bipolar (hypomanic symptoms).

For several years I have felt I can talk to God. No, I don't hear his voice, he doesn't speak to me auditorily, I don't see him. But I would get a lot of signs from the universe and was able to speak to him in a way and get a response. I never spoke to a therapist about this because this is something I quite enjoyed and never thought of as weird.

I was put on Strattera for my ADHD last year. Since then, God has stopped talking to me. It doesn't even make sense because there is no reason to believe Strattera would stop delusions, and it has even been known to induce psychosis in some people.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know whether these were spiritual delusions or not, but I sort of feel maybe they were. It upsets me nothing my once close relationship to God may have all just been in my head. I want to feel close to God and talk to him again, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm just delusional. I felt my spirituality was a huge aspect of my identity and I've lost that part of me. And I feel stupid knowing I would proudly tell people about talking to God, and 'you too can speak to God.' Like obviously I sounded psychotic to these people.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anybody else on this forum felt sad or empty after losing some delusions? Anybody else dealing with something similar? Any advice on how to get my relationship with God back without feeling crazy?

I didn&amp;#39;t realize the sun was setting so early, it&amp;#39;s getting dark and I really hate walking through the woods at night esp by myself so I&amp;#39;m probably just gonna chill here and procrastinate it a bit, at least until the moon comes out and there&amp;#39;s some light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to chat on discord but we can talk in the comments too. I&amp;#39;m kind of getting paranoid bc I&amp;#39;m in a small town and I&amp;#39;m kind of like a free spirit alternative looking individual so everyone looks at me weird or just avoids eye contact and I feel like I&amp;#39;m being watched&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t believe the word is simulated by a computer but I believe that it exists in the mind of the Godhead/ the one. The numbers feel like codes of some kind and I don’t know it’s the will of heaven that I’m drawn to obess over them or it’s just my illness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I made sense I know I tend to make word salads.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hello. I am 28. Male. 5'6''. 67 Kg / 148 lbs. Non smoker. Non-drinker. Indian. 

So all this begun in 2013. I was feeling unusually relaxed despite critical test that I was about to appear for. Fast forward 2 months I performed very badly in the test and barely passed. After getting admission in not-so-good college I had episodes of extreme anxiety over high tension wires that was in the locality of my college. You have to pass below those towers to get to the college. I was so scared that i tried to get in other colleges or leave engineering altogether and choose different career option. I was then taken to a career counsellor where they concluded that civil services was actually a better option for me instead of engineering. There the counsellor convinced me to continue engineering and later appear for civil services examination after graduating from engineering college.

 I was convinced and I continued with my engineering career. In 2016 I remember two events that could contribute to my current predicament. One was doing a horrible sin / crime for which I did not at the time feel any remorse. It was after my brother found out about the same I was in shock for a whole evening. The second event involves  me watching a trailer to Bollywood movie which caused sort of existential crisis in me after which I started to read up on religion and spirituality. After graduating in 2017 I was left with question of what to do next. Over the next few years I had similar experiences where my I felt hyperventilated, i felt as if I was naked (despite wearing usual clothing) and my private part was chopped off and my heart had gone weak while surfing the web. My vitamin d3 is 70 ng/ml and b12 is 950 pg/ml. Because I am convinced my illness is because nutritional deficiency I take 2 multivitamins, 1 antioxidant capsule, 1 iron supplement, 1 B-complex capsule, 2 magnesium 200 mg, milk (for calcium), 1/4 zinc acetate (25 mg) On and Off since 6 months. Stopped D3 and B12 after testing and getting high results. I used to take High Dosage supplements for those too for a suspected deficiency. I have been to dozens of medical professionals since 2016 and their diagnosis is schizophrenia, depression and anxiety.

My initial symptoms (since 2019 heart collapse feeling episode) were :

* Feeling restless and weak hearted and spaced out
* experience of life feels shallower than before
* Feels like I am living on autopilot
* Mind feels unusually blank most of time
* thoughts are not vivid as they were before
* Decreased alertness
* Decreased attention
* Brain Fog
* Zoned out most of the time
* Decreased concentration.
* Decreased cognitive abilities
* Decreased mental Faculties
* Confusion 

&amp;#x200B;

After the cocktail of supplements I took in past year original symptoms were not resolved but new scary symptom were added

&amp;#x200B;

* Apathy ( this makes my experience crazier than ever as I just want to sleep all day compared to my previous self which was atleast active and addicted to screen 24/7).
* mind feels numb.
* Dulled sensory experience.

,schizophrenia,"I will start off by saying I'm pretty lucky as I am high-functioning (I got my Masters recently and, as long as I take my medications, I can maintain fairly normal relationships), but it feels like because of that, my friends and family tend to forget that I have a (at times) fairly debilitating condition. 

My paranoia isn't as bad as before I was medicated, but sometimes I just cannot go outside my house, and when I try to explain the reason why, people think I am being lazy or something, so I had to start making up excuses that sound more ""legitimate."" I actually failed a class because of this which delayed my graduation by a semester. People making fun of me for not leaving my house, even if it's a joke, still hurts. 

I DESPISE having my picture taken, being on camera, or being recorded and people immediately assume it's because I don't like how I look or sound or something and try telling me stuff about that even when I explain it has nothing to do with that.

I find it nearly impossible to confide in people because I always have a nagging feeling that they will stab me in the back any second, which makes people think I am distant or cold. My parents always tell me that I should be more open with them and I just don't have the heart to tell them that I do not trust them (or anyone else really).

People don't understand that in the rare moments of time when my mind is clear I need to utilize it and focus on my work/projects for like 18 hours without being interrupted and it makes me upset when I can't do that. Also, just because I have a video/music on my second monitor doesn't mean I'm not being productive, I just need the constant audio to suppress my auditory hallucinations. 

I played on a college esports team and the amount of times I heard things like ""schizo moment"", ""schizo calls"", ""went schizo for a moment"" was unbelievable, especially considering several of them knew I was schizophrenic (I try to be fairly open about it to try and destigmatize as much as I can). 

Had a friend that went through a manic episode and it was honestly disheartening the way my other friends wanted to deal with it (basically just cut him off) before I stepped in to tell them to be a bit more understanding and get him help since he's clearly going through an episode. It only reinforced my fear that if I go through a particularly severe paranoid episode, there might be no one there for me. 

This is not to mention the negative symptoms. Like I'm sorry that I don't have an emotional reaction to anything (other than annoyance sometimes), that my voice is monotone, that it's hard for me to take care of myself or even care about it. I'm trying my best, but sometimes it's not enough. Honestly, started crying as I wrote this and it's the most emotion I've felt in years.

Also, just because I have a video/music on my second monitor doesn&amp;#39;t mean I&amp;#39;m not being productive, I just need the constant audio to suppress my auditory hallucinations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played on a college esports team and the amount of times I heard things like &amp;quot;schizo moment&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;schizo calls&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;went schizo for a moment&amp;quot; was unbelievable, especially considering several of them knew I was schizophrenic (I try to be fairly open about it to try and destigmatize as much as I can). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a friend that went through a manic episode and it was honestly disheartening the way my other friends wanted to deal with it (basically just cut him off) before I stepped in to tell them to be a bit more understanding and get him help since he&amp;#39;s clearly going through an episode. It only reinforced my fear that if I go through a particularly severe paranoid episode, there might be no one there for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to mention the negative symptoms. Like I&amp;#39;m sorry that I don&amp;#39;t have an emotional reaction to anything (other than annoyance sometimes), that my voice is monotone, that it&amp;#39;s hard for me to take care of myself or even care about it. I&amp;#39;m trying my best, but sometimes it&amp;#39;s not enough. Honestly, started crying as I wrote this and it&amp;#39;s the most emotion I&amp;#39;ve felt in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idk, I get that I&amp;#39;m lucky that I can mostly seem to live a normal life, but I just can&amp;#39;t help and wish that I could actually live a normal life.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Does anyone else here find the mornings the most difficult part of the day? 

I used to love mornings but lately they're quite challenging. 

I think it might be because my night-time Risperidone has worn off and my morning dose needs a bit of time to kick in, but I always find the first few hours of the day the hardest. It mostly seems to be my energy levels that are affected, I just feel slow and dead in the mornings, but I also feel more anxious and sometimes a little paranoid depending on the day. 

It almost feels like each day I have a mountain to climb, I start off the mountain feeling crappy, then over the first couple of hours of the day I climb up to alright, then by hour 4-5 or so I'm feeling decent, and on good days by hour 7-9 I'll be feeling *good*. Once I'm there I usually stay there for the rest of the day until something happens to throw off my mood, which means every night I'm always dreading going to sleep, because in the night I'm feeling pretty good usually, but at the same time I know the good feeling I have will be gone again in the morning and I'll have to make the climb again.

It's one of the reasons I'm struggling to give up smoking again because in the past I started off weaning off the cigarettes by delaying my morning cigarette as long as possible - but recently my mornings have been rough and those first couple of cigarettes feel like the one thing getting me through it.

,schizophrenia,"hi all,

i’m a fictional author and always trying to include diverse representation in my books. my current work-in-progress is a romance told from the POV of the female main character who falls for the male main character who has schizophrenia. The book is not about the MMC’s schizophrenia, but it is a rather small subplot which i want to be as accurate as possible.

I’ve read through this subreddit a LOT and I have a few unanswered questions:

For those of you that are medicated/in therapy, what are your day to day “symptoms” (forgive me if this is poor terminology)?

Those of you in relationships, what are the best ways your partners have supported you? (Or ways that partners made things harder for you?)

&amp; any other advice I should know? (i.e. poor representations you’ve seen before/things I should avoid?) 

I appreciate this greatly. I can read all day in the DSM-5 or in research journals, but nothing is better than advice straight from the very people I’m attempting to represent.

&lt;p&gt;i’m a fictional author and always trying to include diverse representation in my books. my current work-in-progress is a romance told from the POV of the female main character who falls for the male main character who has schizophrenia. The book is not about the MMC’s schizophrenia, but it is a rather small subplot which i want to be as accurate as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve read through this subreddit a LOT and I have a few unanswered questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you that are medicated/in therapy, what are your day to day “symptoms” (forgive me if this is poor terminology)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of you in relationships, what are the best ways your partners have supported you? (Or ways that partners made things harder for you?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp; any other advice I should know? (i.e. poor representations you’ve seen before/things I should avoid?) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate this greatly. I can read all day in the DSM-5 or in research journals, but nothing is better than advice straight from the very people I’m attempting to represent. &lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hello,

I don’t know if I have this post tagged right, I apologize if it’s not.  I have some questions and I could really use some advice from people who have experience.

My partner recently had a pretty severe psychotic episode with delusions and hallucinations that landed him in the hospital.  We previously thought he had bipolar disorder, but the doctors thought otherwise after what they observed.  He was communicating to aliens, god, getting messages from tv shows, among other things.  He claimed he was channeling aliens, angels, demons.  Yelling in loud voices and shaking around, laughing hysterically at random points.  Then he’d just stare and not respond, occasionally shaking his head or nodding, chuckling — he was communicating with them, he said.  He’d go through periods of really intense negative emotion, happiness, and no emotion — according to him.  At one point he said he was channeling my spirit that was a demon trying to turn into an angel.  Eventually it subsided to a point that was less outwardly visible, but says the aliens/angels are testing him and making him a better person.  They told him not to lie and are making him tell me things that he has been lying to me about for like over 10 years.  I don’t want to go into details, but I’m reeling because I remember the incidents he’s telling me and remember thinking he was lying to me at the time.  I feel sick and feel like I’m in shock.

My question is, I guess — is it possible for his delusions to cause him to become more honest, like compulsively almost, because he says they’re making him a better person and making him tell the truth?  I’m so confused right now.  And the mood swings and staring off into the distance and not responding are scaring me.

He has an appointment with his psychiatrist soon.  He still doesn’t know what’s going on and I don’t think he can really consider that he could be sick.  I’m not sure how to help him right now.  I have a mental illness myself and I feel like I’m losing my sanity.

I’m not judging him, I realize this is rough.  I feel so bad for him.  :(

,schizophrenia,"Hi guys,  


I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia 6/7 years ago, I had awful delusions and hallucations, I didn't know what was real and what wasn't, my whole personality changed to try and face the new 'reality' that I was living in. However, with a combination of CBT, Ariprazole, Risperidone and Quetiapine (Not al at once, jesus) I managed to crawl my way out of the delusions, and the hallucinations without the delusions are an irritant at worst.  


But I'm still struggling with the negative symptoms 4/5 years later, I thought the emotional issues were potentially a defence mechanism that my brain would eventually repair, but they're still occuring.   


Let me describe what I'm experiencing now:

  
\- Incredibly low ""social battery"", after 30-60 minutes of conversation, my social battery feels completely empty, I can't think of things to say, I can't join in on any jokes, I pretty much go completely non-verbal for 30 minutes until I recharge, in a group this is fine, but 1 on 1 it makes for pretty awkward situations  


\- Emotional blunting/severe apathy, unless I'm intoxicated, I don't feel any emotion towards what people say or do, I don't get defensive, I don't get upset, I don't get offended, I don't find things funny, I don't express gratitude or love properly, I don't express concern etc. Outwardly I can still express these emotions in pantomine, but some people see straight through me and I can come across as fake or ingenuine. Before the schizophrenia I was a very emotionally intelligent and outwardly displaying person, but now I feel like a borderline psychopath emotionally.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sleep issues, I have never been able to sleep correctly, and can only sleep when I'm on brink of passing out from exhaustion. I've managed to get a 12-8 shift at my 9-5 to allow me to fall asleep at 4/5am without major consequence, but I would like to get some insight on this, and see if it's a result of the negative symptoms or just a personal thing, as I've had trouble with sleep ever since I was a child  


I would be interested to know if anybody has faced these same negative symptoms, and potential solutions to properly mitigate them. The fact that I tend to be okay emotionally when I'm intoxicated makes me think there's some sort of psychological block there, but on the other hand, the increased confidence could just improve my self deception. Either way, this tends to make me use alcohol and substances as a crutch when socialising, which I could do without.

,schizophrenia,"Hello,

My wife has noticed I have good and bad cycles. Ups and Downs. During the downs I’m very withdrawn, inward, and suspicious. During the ups I’m just pretty normal. 

She’s noticed some signs about to have a down. I thought this was interesting and just wanted to share.

1) I’ll get very opinionated and argumentative 

2) I stop really focusing on the current and new and focus more on like existing I guess? Idk she said I get really philosophical and interested in the way the universe is swirling around me and like brushing my teeth. 

3) I either stop eating as much or eat way more. During an up I’ll eat pretty healthy and a lot of different things. When I’m down I eat more hearty comfort meals and nostalgic things that remind me of my childhood.

4) I will do things that bring me a lot of comfort. I’ll start the harry potter series over or lord of the rings. When I’m good I’ll seek out new books.

5) I’ll get really religious when I’m starting to decline too.

Does this apply to any of yall to? What does your rock look for to monitor your mental health?

&lt;p&gt;1) I’ll get very opinionated and argumentative &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) I stop really focusing on the current and new and focus more on like existing I guess? Idk she said I get really philosophical and interested in the way the universe is swirling around me and like brushing my teeth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) I either stop eating as much or eat way more. During an up I’ll eat pretty healthy and a lot of different things. When I’m down I eat more hearty comfort meals and nostalgic things that remind me of my childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) I will do things that bring me a lot of comfort. I’ll start the harry potter series over or lord of the rings. When I’m good I’ll seek out new books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) I’ll get really religious when I’m starting to decline too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this apply to any of yall to? What does your rock look for to monitor your mental health?&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"I’ve been diagnosed for more than a decade and at a fairly good level of medication where I don’t get too symptomatic and I’m not too doped out.
