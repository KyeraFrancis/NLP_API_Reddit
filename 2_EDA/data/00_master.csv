,Army,"Long time lurker here, figured I'd finally post.

Been a nasty girl since 2019 and it's been a complete waste of time. Am a 1LT and I don't know anything about the Army or my job (35A). The most they've ever tasked me with is figuring out the weather. The couple of times they've asked me to do more, I did a whole bunch of work, just to be told to disregard.Ive just taken up the unofficial job of going to bat for soldiers nobody wants to listen to.

I dropped a CAD packet and it got approved. Am now waiting to get scrolled. I spoke to a Captain who will receive my scroll and cut my orders. She advised she has duty stations in Korea, Hood, and Bliss.

From my time spent lurking, Hood sounds like a mess so if I get to choose, I'll avoid it. Bliss sounds better but not by a whole lot. Korea sounds like the way to go.

The sticking point is promotion boards. If I get in early 2024, I'll be just 4 months or so from O-3. She expressed some hesitation on sending me to Korea with my promotion so close. 

I can guess at why but I don't understand enough about this process to understand it. Why couldn't I just promote in Korea? Why would promoting stateside be an easier process?

She said she could delay my promotion by 18mo but given the pay difference that sounds like a major L.

,Army,"I'm summoning those of you who are *only* **currently active duty** or **retired**. 

This is about a topic of a veteran wanting to go back in, active duty and looking for your outtake.

The reason why I'm seeking opinions only from active duty or retired veterans is because there are too many biased opinions of us veterans when the topic is brought up about *going back into the military*. Yeah, I get it, going back in, is a stupid idea - to you? I get it, ok. But I already heard your reasons, let me hear it from the updated/current sources that knows what the fuck is going on, right now.

So. I'm a veteran. I wanna go back into the military, as an officer. I did four years in the military, enlisted,, infantry (3 combat tours), got out, went to school using my GI bill and got my degree. The main goal prior to me even getting out, was to go to school, get my degree and go back in as an officer. I started contracting overseas as soon as I got out and did my schooling online. Made bank. The whole money chase is over for me, I made great fucking money high six figures but it didn't bring me happiness. Job felt missionless/empty. Along the way, met many veterans talk about VA VA VA VA. Did my VA shit, slightly forgetting the idea of going back in and only claimed minimal stuff. I have 30% disability now with a possible option for a higher rating (if i claim more, I only claimed my knees). I've been out for some time now, about 5 years now going on 6. I'm fit and live an active life style. I am now in a job doing what I got a degree in. This idea of going back in has stuck with me and even working with the military now but the AF, I still can think of myself going back in. (Side note: I can't ask this question to the military I work with right now, AF, because these mf'ers are a different breed. Gauges, beards, get off early, don't police call - just a different fucking bread) and I get it. Times are different now. Whatever, merry christmas, doesn't phase me. I just can't ask this question because the AF lifestyle is fucking different and I'm not looking to join the AF. I already tried :). Fun fact, if you've been out for 5 years, you can't ever enlist. Second fun fact, going officer in the AF is a min 2 year wait. And they are fucking selective on who they choose. I'm not that god damn smart. I wasn't stellar in college, I did enough to get my fucking degree. And they base their selection on additional shit like voulenteer time and other side shit. Gotta pass. Anyway back to my story. The idea of going back in has stuck with me pretty much since getting out. I do like the military lifestyle, I like being on base, I like all aspects of the military. The purpose of my goal here, is because I want a retirement. I've met countless veterans while contracting overseas who were retired, getting their retirement checks, and VA, plus the check for work. I always envied that. I don't want to retire in the US. Thats my point. Sure, VA is nice if you get a high rating but when it comes time for me to retire. I don't wanna HAVE to work if I don't need to. Having 2 guaranteed paychecks, plus if I retire as a civ somewhere, so 3, and when I get to the age for social securtity, thats 4 checks, sure as hell sounds a lot better than just 1 (VA) or 2 (VA) and a (CIV) job and then later SS. Plus the VA never really has anything saying the VA the VA is forever or at least I dont know if it exists, I cant find it, and with the amount of veterans getting out on a daily basis and claiming VA, getting 100%, fuck I don't even know what the system is going to look like in the next 10 years. I would hate to be relying soley on that and then it ends up stopping or some shit. Thats scary. I'm okay with the current changes the military has shifted to. I've been out long enough,, and worked in enough enviorments that Im well adjusted. To be nice. I'm not a hard ass; knife hander, all that shit. But I am about the military - I like the lifestyle, fitness standards of having to PT every fucking day, I like the idea of moving around consistently, while having a job for stability. The hours and all that shit, late nights, duty, doesn't phase me. I'm over it - It's the military. And I get all that shit.

Clearly you see my mind is made up here already, I'm just looking for some non-biased kick back on my *idea here.*

I guess what I'm trying to really ask here is. How do you like the military right now? (And I know everyone's opinion is different or going to be different on this but from the current sources, whats going on now?). Are you regretting staying in right now - why, or did you regret retiring? What do you think about my idea here?

Basically I'm just thinking - and trying to realistically have an apporach or prepation about my plan/idea here of going back in. It's like if you have your boys and they tell you that chick is bad news, but you go through it anyway and later regret it, and wish you would have listened. Like I'm essentially just romanticizing about the idea of going back in, as an officer, to end up, maybe not enjoying being back in for whatever reason. Then regretting why I gave up all these other options that I could have, had.  


Let me hear it.",t2_gp02qzmsq,False,,0,False,Question for those currently Active Duty or Retired,[],r/army,False,7.0,,0,,,False,t3_18pb3wn,False,dark,0.62,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1703354264.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m summoning those of you who are &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;currently active duty&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;retired&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about a topic of a veteran wanting to go back in, active duty and looking for your outtake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I&amp;#39;m seeking opinions only from active duty or retired veterans is because there are too many biased opinions of us veterans when the topic is brought up about &lt;em&gt;going back into the military&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah, I get it, going back in, is a stupid idea - to you? I get it, ok. But I already heard your reasons, let me hear it from the updated/current sources that knows what the fuck is going on, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. I&amp;#39;m a veteran. I wanna go back into the military, as an officer. I did four years in the military, enlisted,, infantry (3 combat tours), got out, went to school using my GI bill and got my degree. The main goal prior to me even getting out, was to go to school, get my degree and go back in as an officer. I started contracting overseas as soon as I got out and did my schooling online. Made bank. The whole money chase is over for me, I made great fucking money high six figures but it didn&amp;#39;t bring me happiness. Job felt missionless/empty. Along the way, met many veterans talk about VA VA VA VA. Did my VA shit, slightly forgetting the idea of going back in and only claimed minimal stuff. I have 30% disability now with a possible option for a higher rating (if i claim more, I only claimed my knees). I&amp;#39;ve been out for some time now, about 5 years now going on 6. I&amp;#39;m fit and live an active life style. I am now in a job doing what I got a degree in. This idea of going back in has stuck with me and even working with the military now but the AF, I still can think of myself going back in. (Side note: I can&amp;#39;t ask this question to the military I work with right now, AF, because these mf&amp;#39;ers are a different breed. Gauges, beards, get off early, don&amp;#39;t police call - just a different fucking bread) and I get it. Times are different now. Whatever, merry christmas, doesn&amp;#39;t phase me. I just can&amp;#39;t ask this question because the AF lifestyle is fucking different and I&amp;#39;m not looking to join the AF. I already tried :). Fun fact, if you&amp;#39;ve been out for 5 years, you can&amp;#39;t ever enlist. Second fun fact, going officer in the AF is a min 2 year wait. And they are fucking selective on who they choose. I&amp;#39;m not that god damn smart. I wasn&amp;#39;t stellar in college, I did enough to get my fucking degree. And they base their selection on additional shit like voulenteer time and other side shit. Gotta pass. Anyway back to my story. The idea of going back in has stuck with me pretty much since getting out. I do like the military lifestyle, I like being on base, I like all aspects of the military. The purpose of my goal here, is because I want a retirement. I&amp;#39;ve met countless veterans while contracting overseas who were retired, getting their retirement checks, and VA, plus the check for work. I always envied that. I don&amp;#39;t want to retire in the US. Thats my point. Sure, VA is nice if you get a high rating but when it comes time for me to retire. I don&amp;#39;t wanna HAVE to work if I don&amp;#39;t need to. Having 2 guaranteed paychecks, plus if I retire as a civ somewhere, so 3, and when I get to the age for social securtity, thats 4 checks, sure as hell sounds a lot better than just 1 (VA) or 2 (VA) and a (CIV) job and then later SS. Plus the VA never really has anything saying the VA the VA is forever or at least I dont know if it exists, I cant find it, and with the amount of veterans getting out on a daily basis and claiming VA, getting 100%, fuck I don&amp;#39;t even know what the system is going to look like in the next 10 years.

We've got great leadership, seemed like his personal life was going great, no obvious signs that he might be depressed or anything, and just out of nowhere he kills himself.

I'm fucking sick of loosing someone almost every year and by the time I've had time to grieve someone else passes away.

,Army,"Good morning, Team.

Context:

I'm on holiday leave from basic. I caught up with my employer and was given favorable news. I'm in the running for a promotion upon returning from OCS.

I chose to drill out of a unit 3 1/2 hours away in N.C. anticipating I would relocate to that particular area for a career opportunity. I was thinking long-term/big picture.

After being made aware of the prospects, I thought it best to be pragmatic, and drill with a unit closer to my residence in W.V./current employer (whether I get promoted or not). I'm happy with my civilian circumstances.

Question(s):

1. Is it possible to switch units during/immediately after IET?

2. If so, what would be the procedure?

My recruiter recommended I speak with the Reserve liaison at basic assuming the drill sergeants grant my request for an appointment. I figure it wouldn't hurt to ask the group for feedback.

If it doesn't work, I'm more than willing to make the drive without complaint. It wouldn't be the end of the world, but I'd like to explore any possibility of drilling in my home state.

I chose MP as my branch.

Any thoughts would be appreciated. I hope all is well.

I&amp;#39;ve had to buy stuff just for them to do it with me. On top of any cost i had for the plane tickets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say they&amp;#39;re doing stuff like gift shopping or finals. But I finished my shopping and classes (though I have less classes) when I was across the country before coming. They act like they care a lot about me coming but it seems I just end up staring at my phone or playing videogames unless I&amp;#39;m asking them to do something. Which typically gets an &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m too busy&amp;quot; in return. &lt;/p&gt;

Im on leave and ended up smoking, no excuse, don't need pity, just honestly need help. My ambition for myself has gone and I feel like now I have no reason to continue my life in the Army anymore.

,Army,"Informational Post for you transitioning folks

For anyone unaware there exists a field in the civilian world called Biomedical Equipment Technician or BMET (there's also a MOS for it that offers some of the best training in the industry so reclassing for it to go reserves or guard is an option as well). You work in a hospital setting repairing and PMCSing medical equipment, everything from hospital bed to MRI machines. You do NOT need a degree to work in this field but having one does make you more marketable. That being said if you are looking to get into a technical field with little to no experience this is a good option.

Firstly there is the college portion. If you choose, you can use your skillbridge to pursue a 2 year degree or certificate as a BMET though the College of Biomedical Equipment Technology. It is completely remote and is done online. Furthermore they will work with hospitals in your area, (or area you plan to relocate to upon ETS) to find you OJT as well, but is not required to complete the course. The President of the college is an Army veteran himself and the school is very much set up to accommodate military service members. That being said, even if you don't purse it as a skillbridge the scheduling works where you could potentially (given you role/MOS) attend the college during your transition window without it being on skillbridge.[https://cbet.edu/programs/](https://cbet.edu/programs/)

Secondly, the company I will be working for, Trimedx, is an independent service provider and has contracts with hospitals all over the US. They also offer a skillbridge internship.

If you have any questions about the field, the college, Trimedx, or even other companies, please feel free to reach out and DM me any questions you might have.

,Army,"I need help and advice about a serious situation my brother is in. I will try to provide the least information because I am afraid for his safety. He enlisted a few years ago and now lives overseas. He married another soldier not a year ago. None of his relatives know much about this person nor have met them in person.

He's being a victim of narcissistic abuse and it has become physical against him. His life has already been in danger. I convinced him to talk to his superiors which he did, but I have strong suspicion this may have backfired in the way that his abuser may have convinced him to get back together and take the fall for any reports he made. I believe even his career may be in danger. 

He's normally very communicative which drastically changed after the last violent event against him by his partner. I also have strong reasons to believe his phone is being monitored by his partner. I know for a fact that there has been times in which his social media posts and even text message replies have been done by his partner and not him. I am certain that since the last violent event against him occurred, his communication with his family is being monitored.

He's a sweet, kind person and unfortunately, this might make him the perfect person to be the victim of this. I not only fear for him facing consequences that do not belong to him, but also for his life and safety.   


What should I do? Should I call someone (his superiors or FAP)  to tell them what I know? Would that do any good? How can I make sure he's safe and that he has a support system that would understand narcissistic abuse and work with men who go through it? I will appreciate any advice and knowledge.

,Army,"We met at the beginning of June, and have been talking every day since. He's in the US, and I'm in the UK. He's also a sergeant in the military, so he's busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven't phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I'm too anxious to, but he's said that he'd find the time and we could whenever I'm ready. But we've sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven't made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.

But I don't know whether that's going to be possible now.

Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn't feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he's 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn't respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he'd been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn't be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn't have a right to know as we weren't officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.

Everything was fine for a while.

But then he didn't respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he'd had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He's had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I'm aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven't heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He's just completely disappeared on me, and I'm absolutely terrified.

I don't have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I'd never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn't big on social media), so there's no way I can ""stalk"" him to somehow find their details either. I've tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there's nothing.

He's a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn't lie about any of this. I really don't want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.

He&amp;#39;s in the US, and I&amp;#39;m in the UK. He&amp;#39;s also a sergeant in the military, so he&amp;#39;s busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven&amp;#39;t phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I&amp;#39;m too anxious to, but he&amp;#39;s said that he&amp;#39;d find the time and we could whenever I&amp;#39;m ready. But we&amp;#39;ve sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven&amp;#39;t made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t know whether that&amp;#39;s going to be possible now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn&amp;#39;t feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he&amp;#39;s 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn&amp;#39;t respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he&amp;#39;d been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn&amp;#39;t have a right to know as we weren&amp;#39;t officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything was fine for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then he didn&amp;#39;t respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he&amp;#39;d had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He&amp;#39;s had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I&amp;#39;m aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven&amp;#39;t heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He&amp;#39;s just completely disappeared on me, and I&amp;#39;m absolutely terrified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I&amp;#39;d never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn&amp;#39;t big on social media), so there&amp;#39;s no way I can &amp;quot;stalk&amp;quot; him to somehow find their details either. I&amp;#39;ve tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there&amp;#39;s nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn&amp;#39;t lie about any of this. I really don&amp;#39;t want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s been in there way too long for a heart attack, he should&amp;#39;ve been out by now. I have no idea what to do and I feel like I can&amp;#39;t cope, I need him back.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"Informational Post for you transitioning folks

For anyone unaware there exists a field in the civilian world called Biomedical Equipment Technician or BMET (there's also a MOS for it that offers some of the best training in the industry so reclassing for it to go reserves or guard is an option as well). You work in a hospital setting repairing and PMCSing medical equipment, everything from hospital bed to MRI machines. You do NOT need a degree to work in this field but having one does make you more marketable. That being said if you are looking to get into a technical field with little to no experience this is a good option.

Firstly there is the college portion. If you choose, you can use your skillbridge to pursue a 2 year degree or certificate as a BMET though the College of Biomedical Equipment Technology. It is completely remote and is done online. Furthermore they will work with hospitals in your area, (or area you plan to relocate to upon ETS) to find you OJT as well, but is not required to complete the course. The President of the college is an Army veteran himself and the school is very much set up to accommodate military service members. That being said, even if you don't purse it as a skillbridge the scheduling works where you could potentially (given you role/MOS) attend the college during your transition window without it being on skillbridge.[https://cbet.edu/programs/](https://cbet.edu/programs/)

Secondly, the company I will be working for, Trimedx, is an independent service provider and has contracts with hospitals all over the US. They also offer a skillbridge internship.

If you have any questions about the field, the college, Trimedx, or even other companies, please feel free to reach out and DM me any questions you might have.

,Army,"I need help and advice about a serious situation my brother is in. I will try to provide the least information because I am afraid for his safety. He enlisted a few years ago and now lives overseas. He married another soldier not a year ago. None of his relatives know much about this person nor have met them in person.

He's being a victim of narcissistic abuse and it has become physical against him. His life has already been in danger. I convinced him to talk to his superiors which he did, but I have strong suspicion this may have backfired in the way that his abuser may have convinced him to get back together and take the fall for any reports he made. I believe even his career may be in danger. 

He's normally very communicative which drastically changed after the last violent event against him by his partner. I also have strong reasons to believe his phone is being monitored by his partner. I know for a fact that there has been times in which his social media posts and even text message replies have been done by his partner and not him. I am certain that since the last violent event against him occurred, his communication with his family is being monitored.

He's a sweet, kind person and unfortunately, this might make him the perfect person to be the victim of this. I not only fear for him facing consequences that do not belong to him, but also for his life and safety.   


What should I do? Should I call someone (his superiors or FAP)  to tell them what I know? Would that do any good? How can I make sure he's safe and that he has a support system that would understand narcissistic abuse and work with men who go through it? I will appreciate any advice and knowledge.

,Army,"We met at the beginning of June, and have been talking every day since. He's in the US, and I'm in the UK. He's also a sergeant in the military, so he's busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven't phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I'm too anxious to, but he's said that he'd find the time and we could whenever I'm ready. But we've sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven't made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.

But I don't know whether that's going to be possible now.

Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn't feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he's 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn't respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he'd been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn't be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn't have a right to know as we weren't officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.

Everything was fine for a while.

But then he didn't respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he'd had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He's had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I'm aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven't heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He's just completely disappeared on me, and I'm absolutely terrified.

I don't have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I'd never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn't big on social media), so there's no way I can ""stalk"" him to somehow find their details either. I've tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there's nothing.

He's a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn't lie about any of this. I really don't want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.

I was active duty, ETS'd to the IRR for a short period, and joined a USAR unit in late 2021. My contract time on the DA3540 was for ""3 years.""

Fast-forward to now and I've filed a PAR and discussed the issue with my units retention NCO, but our RPAC office hasn't kept me updated on the process, and I had to push just for them to say they only partially had my paperwork and needed ""enlistment forms, like your original DD-4.""

,Army,"Currently AD 15Y getting medboarded for bilateral wrist issues ( Left wrist ECU subluxation and Right wrist TFCC tear) during the medboard process I was in a car accident and while bracing before impact, the energy transfered through my right hand to my wrist, shoulder blade and neck. My usability of my right wrist and hand has now worsened. PEBLO has ""OKed"" me for surgery on the left as it is my dominant hand and on the waitlist pending updated mri of my right wrist to see if further damage is present. 

My question is should hold off the surgery until I get out through the VA? I will eventually need surgery on both wrists. My mum used to work for the VA hospital and knows the horror stories of veterans waiting for care. I've heard improvements have been done through the news but I am sure going through this community would give me better insight.

Also, my plan is to get out medically from army and go back to school via Gi bill and get my 2nd bachelors in advertising. I was originally going to work on helicopters components in line with my MOS, but considering my wrist issues I feel it would be safer to return to my creative nature.

Potential options I am weighing:

° Get out no surgery, get care through VA eventually.
° Get surgery on left, get out, get care through VA eventually for right wrist.
° Get surgery on both wrists, get out with lower VA percentage or possibly found fit for duty.

Please let me know your experiences and advice.

,Army,"How long did your conditional release take?

So a little back story. I finished my active duty contract in February of 2022 and rolled into the reserves. So I’ve been in the reserves since February of 2022. I signed a 4 year contract so it ends in 2026. A few months in, I realized i made a mistake. The reserves is ass. But I kept trucking on. I’ve been struggling alot financially, and mentally. I was gonna wait until the end of the contract to go back active but i dont want to wait that long so I am about to start the process of a conditional release. I know it can take awhile but if anyone has experienced it, how long did yours take? Any advice you can give me? Also if you got a bonus, did you pay it back? And if you’re married to an AD soldier, can you be at the same duty station or does the big army send you wherever once active again?

Are they lonelier than normal? 80-90% go to see family so I'm not sure that's it. Do they not want to see family? Don't like their hometown? Are they out of whack with a different routine or lost without a routine?

I'm just trying to pinpoint what it is about this time of year that makes people extra depressed and/or suicidal. 

To be honest I'm just trying to figure it out for myself at the moment and see why I'm struggling so much these past couple of months. This week it's gotten worse and of course I'm away from my duty location. I may have to use some resources that I'd rather not use. I'm really trying to just make it through the week.

,Army,"Hey y’all, using a burner coz people I know follow my other acc. I’m enlisting in the army sometime in the coming weeks but I’m having second thoughts due to the current political state of the US. I’ve always dreamed of being in the armed forces, but I don’t want to risk being in the military if someone who literally committed treason gets elected. Does the president really have that much of an effect on people in the military? I know it’s kind of a stupid question but I’m genuinely curious.

,Army,"I’ve never posted on Reddit before, so I hope it’s ok I ask for some lenience. I’ve been with my boyfriend for two years, and I’ve never been more in love with a person. I am 19, he is 20, and I know I’m young and naive, but I can’t imagine a future without him. I’ve known since meeting him he’s wanted to join the army. It’s always been a hard subject to talk about, as I never supported it. I have strong negative opinions about the army (I’m trying to learn more, as I want to be more comfortable when he speaks about it) and he also knows this. For a long time we’d procrastinate and avoid talking about the army because I didn’t wanna hear it. 

About a year ago he dropped out of college because he just figured he couldn’t do it. He had a good job, and it wasn’t like he had no where to go. He has a loving family, a friend group, a good job, a girlfriend. But I know he’s always wanted to do this. I know it’s something bigger than me, and it wasn’t fair of me to try to convince him otherwise, to just be an EMT or a cop, anything but leaving me for the army. I couldn’t stand the thought. But he went to the recruiters and after a lot of back and forth papers on medical issues he finally was accepted. He only had ten days before leaving. And two days before he left, he told me he signed for six years instead of four, though he had previously told me four. It broke my heart. In BCT he sent me letters, telling me how much he loved me. I never responded, it was too painful. I’d write drafts but never send them. 

When he got to AIT he called, and we talked for hours, FaceTiming everyday in his personal time. It felt good. Having him home for the holidays feels intoxicating, I’ve missed him so much and every second I’m around him I feel high off of him. But I know he is leaving again soon. I don’t know how people do this, I don’t know where to start on opening up to knowing things about the army. I hate guns, I have strong opinions on them, but he has a strong interest in them and it makes me uncomfortable. 

Is it worth it to try to change my mindset for him and this relationship? I want it to be but I don’t want to lose my own morals. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this? How did you manage to stay together through the absence? Was it all worth it and after their time served is it easier?

,Army,"Greetings Reddit,

I am set to deploy for basic training on January 2nd, having chosen the 94R (Survivability and Equipment Repairer) MOS and entering as an E4. The reason I'm reaching out to Reddit is that I've been grappling with serious doubts about my decision to join the Army. To provide some context, I went through a mid-life crisis, left my hometown, and moved up north with my mother to pursue this path. In doing so, I left everything behind with no intention of returning. My impulsive nature led me to make this significant decision in a relatively short timeframe, deciding to enlist in September. Now, with about a week left before I ship out, I'm second-guessing my choice. It feels like I rushed into this commitment without fully considering the implications of the 4-5-year contract I'm about to sign.

My tendency to overthink things has me questioning whether I should have pursued Officer Candidate School (OCS) instead of enlisting to secure a more stable future. Despite these second thoughts, I feel pressured to join the Army due to the financial constraints and debt I'm currently facing. I regret not taking more time to research my military options before making such a life-changing decision. Unfortunately, that ship has sailed, and I must face the reality of my current situation.

I find myself at a crossroads, torn between my unsatisfying old life, despite having education, skills, and a strong work ethic, and the potential for a steady income and success with the Army. Fearful of making the wrong decision that will impact years of my life, I feel a sense of urgency to choose a path quickly.

For clarity, I have a 4-year-old son whose mother supports my decision to join the Army. We had a 50/50 agreement for our son's custody before I left, aiming to ensure his access to both parents despite our separation. The stark reality of the Army's distance from my son has recently hit me, leading to feelings of depression.

Despite feeling lost, I believe pursuing the Army is my only choice at this point to avoid drowning in debt. It's a disconcerting sensation, as it seems like I'm joining the military for reasons different from my initial expectations.

I'm open to answering any questions about my situation and would appreciate any feedback, whether positive or negative.",t2_q1gtn6qsq,False,,0,False,Seeking Guidance and Feedback on Military Decision and Concerns,[],r/army,False,7.0,,0,,,False,t3_18q3vf0,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1703451944.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"I am enlisted currently, but I am just curious what the process to go from enlisted to officer is just for future reference if I decide to go that route later in my career. When I first enlisted my recruiter mentioned the green to gold program but my research into that has said that it is only open to Active-Duty people. I am currently in my last year of my bachelor's degree so I believe that may rule out ROTC, and it isn't even offered at my college anyways.

,Army,"I've been thinking about how the Army treats driving a lot recently. My specific base has \~60% of the soldiers in the unit living in barracks 30-45 minutes away from their place of duty. That leads to a lot of ride sharing, which has consistently led to soldiers having give rides in difficult circumstances. I'm all for ride sharing but it shouldn't be a requirement. I actually had to drive my NCO to work for a solid 6 months and never received any compensation, but moving on. 

There's a non-zero amount of soldiers here who can't legally drive because they don't have a US state driver's license required to apply for the host nation equivalent. Most people gloss over the word ""state"" when dealing with that, but that seems like a huge issue to me. It baffles me that soldiers are required to interface with the DMV/BMV from their home state just to certify that they are a competent driver.

A significant amount of people join the military for the express purpose of distancing themselves from their home, and that has an overlap with soldiers who, for whatever reason, don't have a license when they join or have a license that expires after they join. There are a lot of extrapolations to be made from this circumstance, but the biggest one in my mind is that soldiers who either can't or don't want to go back to their home state might not be able to maintain their driving privileges. 

Many DMV/BMV's have restrictions on how much they allow you to do remotely. Not to mention, they are generally extremely strict and may require multiple appointments to resolve an issue. This is a fundamental conflict with the military because a huge amount of soldiers don't reside is the same state as their DMV/BMV. In my unit's circumstance, they are stationed a $800-$1500 plane ticket away. Factoring in more considerations like leave, lodging, and transportation, It's a monumental task to undertake with no support from the military.

It seems to me that there is an extremely simple, albeit congress-level, solution to this. The creation of a DOD-wide ""Military driver's license"" would be an increase in quality of life for many soldiers. It could be a bona-fide ID card and simply certify that the holder is a trained and competent operator of motor vehicles. Testing could be performed in the same way they do motorcycle safety classes with a small classroom portion and then a practical test.

I know this issue isn't high visibility like mold or low pay, but I feel it's an important one nonetheless. In the meantime, I'll keep praying my engine doesn't seize up and my tires stay leakless.

I can’t afford anything. I got fired from my job and drained my entire savings just trying to survive. And it’s ironic because I got fired for being suicidal in the first place, and now here I am. Right back to the same spot. This time tho, I know better than to ask for help or admit to anyone that I’m feeling that way. That’s what got me in this hell hole to begin with. 

I’m going to lose my car. I can’t make rent so I guess I’ll move my stuff out and let my roommates find a replacement. I can’t even afford groceries. It feels like I’ve been fighting to keep my head above water for so long and I just can’t keep treading any longer. I just want to stop swimming and drown. 

I can’t get hired within my career anymore because my last job won’t give a good reference. The ARNG wants to separate me because I’m not mentally stable enough. Which, I don’t know anyone that would be “stable” when dealt the hand I’ve been dealt the last two years. I can’t even get a release to go active duty.

,Army,"Hey everyone, recently I’ve been looking and wanting to join the Army as 35T but I’m stuck atm, here’s why.

Mid 2018 I was in highschool (minor) when a group of kids got in trouble, including myself. Long story short, I smoked marijuana for the first and only time. Few days later we all get caught. I had a cartridge battery in my bag (no residue of any sort as far as I can remember) when a police officer discovered it. They sent it to go get “it tested” I didn’t hear anything back from them. I received a misdemeanor for Drug paraphernalia that day. They called my parents to the school, explained the situation and we went home. I was never placed under arrest, never went/faced a judge/ nor did I get my finger prints taken. I did a diversion program that expunges your charge when you’re 18. I completed what was needed and got a letter in the mail when I turned 18 stating my charge has been “expunged” from my record (I know it can still be brought up) After highschool I started working for the Gov and was told I need a clearance. Filled out the SF86 form and listed my accident that happened. They asked questions and was given my clearance that same day. I want to see what the possibility is for me getting a TS/SCI that is required for 35T mos ? Do I have a shot at this ??

,Army,"'Twas the night before Christmas
And high in the sky
A single, lone plane
Through the air did fly

On board a Paratrooper
And pallets of toys
Ready for heavy drop
To good girls and boys

Now Santa stands ready
Only ten minutes more
The jumpmaster says
""Stand in the door!""

Santa Claus jumps out
As the red light turns green
His parachute rigged toys
From the ground can be seen

The toys fall in chimneys
All across the land
Bringing joy and smiles
And a Christmas so grand

The Christmas drop was successful
And Santa PLFs with precision
Because Santa is a Paratrooper
With the 82nd Airborne Division

Happy Holidays!

&gt;After  years of headlines and watchdog reports condemning shoddy living  conditions for service members and families, a consensus appears to be  developing between Army senior leaders, housing executives and even  lawmakers that something drastic must occur to fix the service’s  barracks and family housing for good.  
&gt;  
&gt;Army  Secretary Christine Wormuth has repeatedly called for a “generational  investment” in the service’s housing and barracks stock that goes beyond  the constraints of the regular budgeting process, in which every  investment comes at the cost of another priority.

Ah yes, throw more studies at the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But some critics are concerned that the service might struggle to take  care of its new and repaired buildings even if such an investment were  to occur. The Army systematically underfunded barracks maintenance  during much of the War on Terror era in order to fund other priorities. 

The problem is that the Army (DOD as a whole really) loves to play the ""we can't fix the barracks or family housing because we spent those funds and we can't raid another pot of money"" and then the service either delays or DOES raid the money for the barracks because ""readiness"". 

If the Army is serious about fixing the issue, the money needs to be locked down.  I don't care if some BDE needs to deploy but couldn't manager their funds or if there are weeds on the small arms ranges.  The money to fix the barracks and family housing should ONLY be spent on housing. 

Fixing housing won't solve all the QOL issues but it will fix one of the biggest ones.

&lt;p&gt;If the Army is serious about fixing the issue, the money needs to be locked down.  I don&amp;#39;t care if some BDE needs to deploy but couldn&amp;#39;t manager their funds or if there are weeds on the small arms ranges.  The money to fix the barracks and family housing should ONLY be spent on housing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing housing won&amp;#39;t solve all the QOL issues but it will fix one of the biggest ones.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"So I'm in my late 20s and I'm interested in trying out for Army Special Operations (Rangers or SF). The mission of the Rangers seems more appealing to me than SF. But I hear a lot of people saying if you are enlisting in your late 20s you should do SF and not Rangers.

Does my age make that much of a difference when trying to decide between those two? Like would my age make that much of a difference in Ranger Regiment? Both obviously would be amazing opportunities and are very interesting, but Rangers overall seems more interesting to me personally due to their mission and specializations.

Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks!

I look on IPPSA with the recruiters I’m working with and they see my leave forms. They have someone else’s name and the dates are super weird. The forms said I’m supposed to be in the office on Christmas Day. I’m also only approved for leave up until the 2nd of January. I know the guy who’s leave form is in my IPPSA and he has to go to airborne school so it makes sense. I’m not due to report to my duty station until mid January.

The recruiters I’m working with seem to think I’m all good to report to my duty station some 2 weeks early. That seems odd to me. My buddy who’s a SPC is telling me I should just report in a day early from when my orders are saying to report there.

The forms said I’m supposed to be in the office on Christmas Day. I’m also only approved for leave up until the 2nd of January. I know the guy who’s leave form is in my IPPSA and he has to go to airborne school so it makes sense. I’m not due to report to my duty station until mid January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recruiters I’m working with seem to think I’m all good to report to my duty station some 2 weeks early. That seems odd to me. My buddy who’s a SPC is telling me I should just report in a day early from when my orders are saying to report there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you guys do?&lt;/p&gt;

Nitty Gritty:

I just passed ten years of service in the reserve. I have one deployment in the past and a med board that followed four years later that cleared me to stay in.

I did three years of therapy, talked all the feelings out, and felt a lot better mentally. I submitted a VA claim somewhere in there and received 60% for a generalized stress and anxiety disorder, tinnitus, and shoulder surgery with a LOD. 

Fun Facts: 

I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder a couple of years after my first deployment, hence the med-board. However, they cleared me after my psychologist reassessed me and diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. 

The following year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Again, news to me, I have been in for eight years at this point and am shitting myself on what was going to happen to me. 

I got kicked off a deployment about two weeks ago and was going to leave soon. I was told I might be medically separated or retired since I am at 60% disability and have much time in service.

Question:

Can I be dishonorably or other than honorably discharged for this?

Should I expect to lose my VA disability or retirement benefits?

I am anxious about it since these both occurred in service well into my career, and I planned on doing my 20 years before leaving. Now, I'm about to lose it all when I was planning on deploying and taking pride in my service and growth.

SW: 235lbs
GW: 170-165lbs
Height: 5’5 ft.

I’m here to get advice and do some research. I intend to post this post in the weight loss/fitness community too, but figured I could try to ask here as well.

I am 22 years old. I am graduating this month with a certified diploma, but want to use this new year to get my ass in gear and start a cut to get fit and ready for enlistment. I’ve spoken to the Army and Marine Corps recruiters, and they are encouraging me to do a few workouts with them and even come get weighed in/taped at the end of every month till I meet their standards. Currently I am researching the pros and cons of each branch before making a in stone decision.

Now, until I reach a certain weight, running/rucking isn’t in motion just yet, but calisthenics and weight lifting is. I wanted to see if anyone could give me advice on which workout routine worked for them? I am looking at a Hybrid Split, but I’ve also heard about PPL x Arnold and 5x5.

The hardest part about my commitment is the nutritional side, I want to hit a high protein calorie deficit, but I work a 5am - 3pm labor job M-F. So F-M are my gym days, so does anyone have any advice on meal prep or anything to help hit my goals?

I’m just in need of any advice or tips, so feel free to throw in your workout routines, your diet plans, supplements, hell, even extra stuff I should know before enlistment. Please and thank you.

Reason I'm asking is that my dad, who passed away in 2020, was in the 11th ACR at two very significant times in their history:  During the Cold War in Germany from 1959 - 1963 and in Vietnam from 1966 - 67.  In fact, Dad was recalled to active duty in the Summer of 1966 when I was 4 years old and we briefly moved to Fort Meade, MD, where the regiment trained up for their deployment.  Then in late Summer they sailed from San Francisco to Vietnam.  Dad was an officer (1LT when he was reactivated and he made Captain while he was in Vietnam.)  I think his last job was Regimental Assistant S3 Air.  

Anyway, when my dad passed away I got a box of ""stuff"" much of which relates to his time with the 11th Cav.  I'm almost 62 and have no kids, and I'd rather give it to a historian than just toss it in the trash.

Prior service Marine coming in as a 35P E5. Shipping to DLI soon and had a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Am I supposed to get my new CAC prior to shipping to DLI?   
My recruiter assumed I just arrive to DLI without one and that sounds off.
2. Will I receive a set of OCP/ASU or am I SOL and required to spend out of pocket?   
I read through older posts saying that uniforms will be issued at AIT, is this the case at DLI?
3. Do I get issued any gear at DLI or is everything issued at AIT?
4. Any DLI/AIT/general tips for a brand new E5/35P with no Army experience?

,Army,"Hello everyone,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I was previously in the army reserve for 6 years. As soon as I switched into active duty, I noticed I was being paid at 0 years TIS instead of 6 years. I immediately went to finance to try to get it fixed and they pointed me to retention. 

I submitted an MMPA packet to retention that corrected my BASD giving me an extra 8-9 months of active duty time, but my PEBD remained the same. Since then, I've been following up with retention every 1-2 months for updates on getting it fixed. Fast forward to now, apparently an MMPA wasn't even what was needed to getting my PEBD (TIS pay) fixed; rather it needed to be my retirement points and a 1506. My brigade retention submitted the 1506 after my battalion retention NCO PCS'd recently, but DFAS pushed it back for an error after 60 days. 

After 30 days of waiting for my brigade retention NCO to resubmit it with the fix, he ended up resubmitting the same 1506 with no changes to DFAS thinking for some reason that it was never submitted in the first place and that the base finance civilian pushed it back to us even though she literally emailed us both with the case number and I called DFAS to check the status on it.

Do you guys think I've given it enough time for retention to fix this issue? I'm going on terminal leave in 4 months and based on my calculations, I'm owed like $18,000 pretax in back pay. I have zero hope for the army to fix my pay once I'm out as a civilian.

Need some help in regulations.
My situation is that I picked up in October, and pinned a week in. Was gonna move out in November because unit was too darn busy to take Permissive TDY and I was In ALC phase 1(I do what them days to do stuff).
November, got DA selected for recruiting as part of that scare while is ALC Phase 1.
Got magic and shoved to the right in March.
Got required MOS training in December with days out of training only myself for my critical section(no time to house hunt.

Got ALC Phase 2 in Jan and get out Feb.
Don't know if after completing recruiting I will be PCSed or not despite not having the time in service and I won't have it(not reenlisting)

Not gonna go through everything to get a place in February to just risk breaking contract  and waste time if I have to move.

Immediate leadership tracking and even CSM cool with it. Been worried about brigade finding out and pushing the issue and with every manner of rank asking me questions.

Can't find anything in post or Army regs that say ""must"" vs ""can"" or ""may"".

I’ll share one: 

Drill Sgt Johnson (fake name) instructs us that he wants each bay to tell him a joke when he comes up for toes on line before lights out. Lit. 

DS Johnson comes into the bay, gets his count and then asks for his joke.

My battle asks “DS Johnson, have you heard the joke about the three midgets?” 

DS Johnson replies “no.”

Perfect. 
My battle starts the joke saying:  

“Ok so there are three midgets all sitting around talking. One realizes, “hey! I have really small hands” and decides that he will get it verified by the Guinness book of world records to see if he has the smallest hands in the world. 

The next midget looks down and says “gee, I think I might have the smallest feet in the world. I’ll go too!”

Finally the third midget looks down and goes “damn. I think I’ve got the smallest dick in the world, I’d better tag along and see if I can get the world record too!” 

So the next day they all walk in to the Guinness book of world records office. 

The first midget walks out after about an hour and a half with a huge grin on his face. “I got it! I have the smallest hands in the world!” He exclaims. 

The second midget comes out about thirty minutes later, smiling ear to ear. He says the same thing “I have the smallest feet in the world!” 

Finally, the third midget comes out of the office shortly after the second. He looks shaken up and really disappointed. His buddies ask “what happened!”

,Army,"You’re having a hard time. Whatever the reason is behind you having a hard time, I’m sorry. Yes you’re strong, yes your independent, yes you got people depending on you, but you need help too. It doesn’t  make you less of a Soldier, it doesn’t mean your weak. It actually means the opposite, you’re reaching out and getting help which can show other service members it’s okay to do so and that’s what leaders do. If your chain of command has an issue with it, fuck them. The only way we’re going to eliminate this negative stigma is by going and getting the help we need then coming back better than ever. It fucking works, so go do it. 

Don’t trust on base BH? That’s fine, go anyways, ask for a referral off base. This has worked in every instance. You’ll have to see the doc on base first to make sure you’re not in immediate danger then they will approve it. The Tricare referral website is simple to use and you can choose a doctor from the directory, call around from those options and find what fits you best with availability, specialty, and gender. 

Toss the booze, the energy drinks, and anything else negative in your life. These attribute to your anxiety and depression significantly. Don’t believe me? Cut it out and hit the gym, it’s okay if you fall a couple times and slip up, get the fuck back up and do it again. See how much better you feel.

Whatever the reason is behind you having a hard time, I’m sorry. Yes you’re strong, yes your independent, yes you got people depending on you, but you need help too. It doesn’t  make you less of a Soldier, it doesn’t mean your weak. It actually means the opposite, you’re reaching out and getting help which can show other service members it’s okay to do so and that’s what leaders do. If your chain of command has an issue with it, fuck them. The only way we’re going to eliminate this negative stigma is by going and getting the help we need then coming back better than ever. It fucking works, so go do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t trust on base BH? That’s fine, go anyways, ask for a referral off base. This has worked in every instance. You’ll have to see the doc on base first to make sure you’re not in immediate danger then they will approve it. The Tricare referral website is simple to use and you can choose a doctor from the directory, call around from those options and find what fits you best with availability, specialty, and gender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toss the booze, the energy drinks, and anything else negative in your life. These attribute to your anxiety and depression significantly. Don’t believe me? Cut it out and hit the gym, it’s okay if you fall a couple times and slip up, get the fuck back up and do it again. See how much better you feel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be a better Soldier, leader, spouse, parent, and member of society. &lt;/p&gt;

They could also draw fire in order to expose the muzzle flashes so that infantrymen may be able to get a better picture.

Please don't come at me for this. Two people with differing opinions and neither of us are in the service. 

Someone served in the marine reserves for around 5 years, give or take. He never went to combat or anything like that, and has no psychological issues from his time in the service. He does from his childhood.

 He was married to a woman and was arrested for hitting her, and somehow honorably discharged. Now several years later he's in jail again for brutally beating his gf woman while under the influence. 

In your opinion, are these the kind of situations that veteran housing is intended for? When he gets out, he will be getting a funded new 1br home to live in.

Yeah, but what about congress? I'm getting there or scroll down (I'm not your boss)

Some highlights since release:

* Over 2,000 downloads and 70 reports. 
* We've established a working relationship with JBLM to get issues addressed sooner rather than later. Most recently an issue with mold and SUDDC (kind of resolved).
* CSM over at Eustis chatted about an issue over there.

**H&amp;C &amp; Congress**

No I'm not running, but some time ago I reached out Jeff Jackson who is a freshman congressman for the state of North Carolina and today I had the pleasure of meeting with his military advisor to chat about Hots&amp;Cots. Nothing has been promised by them, but they are working to see what avenues are available for H&amp;C and we plan to touch base again in the New Year. I wish I had more, but of the dozen elected officials I reached out to he was the only one that got back to me.

The longer I’m out, the older I get, the more the war seems like some distant dream that never happened. Some memories are like they happened yesterday.

I find myself laying in bed at night unable to sleep wondering how the hell I got here. I think I struggle having an identity because going to combat was all I ever wanted to do growing up.

Now I’m 31 and feel like life is so meaningless. I have a wife and a dog, I have a great career, I’m in great shape and look young for my age. I really have no complaints other than everything in life feels so fake, like a giant charade.

Part of me feels like I left my soul in Afghanistan, now I’m a grown man going through the motions of life because I’m ‘supposed’ too. Its hard for me to find ‘purpose’ in anything I do. The only pain I feel is the memories of two dead friends killed in action from my platoon and the thought of my dog dying.

What really throws me off is thinking of how they were 19 &amp; 21 when they were killed, I was 19. We were so young, kids. Its hard to rationalize to myself I survived and my life will keep moving on while theirs was cut so short.

One of the hardest pills for me to swallow is how nobody really cares. I put the USMC and being a combat grunt on such a pedestal growing up. When I was finally in, I felt so much pride. I loved coming home on leave and seeing how proud of me my family was. Now, nobody even asks me about the war, even my family. As time moved on, so did they. I’m safe now and they don’t have to worry about losing a brother or son. I don’t ever talk about the Marines or the military to anyone in my life. I even signed up for the VFW, but in my town there are no combat vets and its hard for me to find common ground with Air Force techs or USCG vets.

My Bn took a ton of casualties over there, including me. Its painful to come to the realization that the average American doesn’t give a shit what we did. I’m not asking for VA disability, parades, etc. I just wish somebody would say ‘Oh man, I heard you fought in Sangin? What was it like over there?’ I’d love to sit down and tell somebody about the change of seasons, how cold it could get, how beautiful it could be too.

Please don't come at me for this. Two people with differing opinions and neither of us are in the service. 

Someone served in the marine reserves for around 5 years, give or take. He never went to combat or anything like that, and has no psychological issues from his time in the service. He does from his childhood.

 He was married to a woman and was arrested for hitting her, and somehow honorably discharged. Now several years later he's in jail again for brutally beating his gf woman while under the influence. 

In your opinion, are these the kind of situations that veteran housing is intended for? When he gets out, he will be getting a funded new 1br home to live in.

The unit described therein is the ""Pogey bait 6th"" of Belleau Wood fame.    Pogey bait is candy, the candy being the bait, so to speak.

,USMC,"Hey all,

It's your Hots&amp;Cots guy. If you're new here and don't know what H&amp;C is, it is a yelp like app for barracks, dfacs, &amp; other parts of the installation for all branches to make positive and negative experiences more public. It was born out of the GAO report back in September. If you're not familiar with it you can get some highlights [here](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1736808351089176803.html)

Yeah, but what about congress? I'm getting there or scroll down (I'm not your boss)

Some highlights since release:

* Over 2,000 downloads and 70 reports. 
* We've established a working relationship with JBLM to get issues addressed sooner rather than later. Most recently an issue with mold and SUDDC (kind of resolved).
* CSM over at Eustis chatted about an issue over there.

You can see the full wrap up [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GBzGIB5XcAAz8CT?format=jpg&amp;name=large).

**H&amp;C &amp; Congress**

No I'm not running, but some time ago I reached out Jeff Jackson who is a freshman congressman for the state of North Carolina and today I had the pleasure of meeting with his military advisor to chat about Hots&amp;Cots.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s your Hots&amp;amp;Cots guy. If you&amp;#39;re new here and don&amp;#39;t know what H&amp;amp;C is, it is a yelp like app for barracks, dfacs, &amp;amp; other parts of the installation for all branches to make positive and negative experiences more public. It was born out of the GAO report back in September. If you&amp;#39;re not familiar with it you can get some highlights &lt;a href=""https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1736808351089176803.html""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, but what about congress? I&amp;#39;m getting there or scroll down (I&amp;#39;m not your boss)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some highlights since release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 2,000 downloads and 70 reports. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#39;ve established a working relationship with JBLM to get issues addressed sooner rather than later. Most recently an issue with mold and SUDDC (kind of resolved).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSM over at Eustis chatted about an issue over there.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No I&amp;#39;m not running, but some time ago I reached out Jeff Jackson who is a freshman congressman for the state of North Carolina and today I had the pleasure of meeting with his military advisor to chat about Hots&amp;amp;Cots.

,USMC,"How’s everyone doing?

The longer I’m out, the older I get, the more the war seems like some distant dream that never happened. Some memories are like they happened yesterday.

I find myself laying in bed at night unable to sleep wondering how the hell I got here. I think I struggle having an identity because going to combat was all I ever wanted to do growing up.

Now I’m 31 and feel like life is so meaningless. I have a wife and a dog, I have a great career, I’m in great shape and look young for my age. I really have no complaints other than everything in life feels so fake, like a giant charade.

Part of me feels like I left my soul in Afghanistan, now I’m a grown man going through the motions of life because I’m ‘supposed’ too. Its hard for me to find ‘purpose’ in anything I do. The only pain I feel is the memories of two dead friends killed in action from my platoon and the thought of my dog dying.

What really throws me off is thinking of how they were 19 &amp; 21 when they were killed, I was 19. We were so young, kids. Its hard to rationalize to myself I survived and my life will keep moving on while theirs was cut so short.

One of the hardest pills for me to swallow is how nobody really cares. I put the USMC and being a combat grunt on such a pedestal growing up. When I was finally in, I felt so much pride. I loved coming home on leave and seeing how proud of me my family was. Now, nobody even asks me about the war, even my family. As time moved on, so did they. I’m safe now and they don’t have to worry about losing a brother or son. I don’t ever talk about the Marines or the military to anyone in my life. I even signed up for the VFW, but in my town there are no combat vets and its hard for me to find common ground with Air Force techs or USCG vets.

My Bn took a ton of casualties over there, including me. Its painful to come to the realization that the average American doesn’t give a shit what we did. I’m not asking for VA disability, parades, etc. I just wish somebody would say ‘Oh man, I heard you fought in Sangin? What was it like over there?’ I’d love to sit down and tell somebody about the change of seasons, how cold it could get, how beautiful it could be too.

In this first interview with Derl Horn, we go over his early childhood, what led him to the Marines, boot camp at Marine Corp Recruiting Depot San Diego, boot camp stories, being the 'grandpa' of his boot camp platoon, and a married Marine moving to ITR, going to Camp Lejeune and Cuba, and then receiving orders to depart for Vietnam. He would be assigned to the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines (1/9) one of the Marine Corps' most legendary battalions with a history from Bougainville, Guam, and Iwo Jima to numerous operations in South Vietnam along the DMZ. In his time with 1/9, he would partake in numerous combat operations, including Operation Buffalo, where Bravo Company would have 57 Marines killed in one day on 2 July 1967. 

If you are interested in Derl's story stay tuned for more interviews, but you may also purchase Derl's memoir, Blood, Sweat and Honor: Memoirs of a Walking Dead Marine in Vietnam.

,USMC,"My plan when I joined the Marine Corps was only to do a single contract. Serve my time while I'm young and capable, do a good job, then get out... I feel I've succeeded in these goals and made a tangible and identifiable difference. Joining this organization has been the most influential and life changing decision I've ever made in my life. The experiences and lessons learned here have completely changed my outlook on life and reversed negative mental habits I sustained as a kid (most of us here can relate).

Now, I'm finding myself having made it on the CRP, and it's creating friction in what I thought was an already decided decision to get out.

Didn't utilize my TA for three years? Now, I could take advantage of it with a second contract. Fatigued from the workload of being a communicator in a Victor unit? Now I have the opportunity to work at a reserve station in my home state.

Serve my time while I&amp;#39;m young and capable, do a good job, then get out... I feel I&amp;#39;ve succeeded in these goals and made a tangible and identifiable difference. Joining this organization has been the most influential and life changing decision I&amp;#39;ve ever made in my life. The experiences and lessons learned here have completely changed my outlook on life and reversed negative mental habits I sustained as a kid (most of us here can relate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m finding myself having made it on the CRP, and it&amp;#39;s creating friction in what I thought was an already decided decision to get out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t utilize my TA for three years? Now, I could take advantage of it with a second contract. Fatigued from the workload of being a communicator in a Victor unit? Now I have the opportunity to work at a reserve station in my home state. &lt;/p&gt;

Yeah, but what about congress? I'm getting there or scroll down (I'm not your boss)

Some highlights since release:

* Over 2,000 downloads and 70 reports. 
* We've established a working relationship with JBLM to get issues addressed sooner rather than later. Most recently an issue with mold and SUDDC (kind of resolved).
* CSM over at Eustis chatted about an issue over there.

**H&amp;C &amp; Congress**

No I'm not running, but some time ago I reached out Jeff Jackson who is a freshman congressman for the state of North Carolina and today I had the pleasure of meeting with his military advisor to chat about Hots&amp;Cots. Nothing has been promised by them, but they are working to see what avenues are available for H&amp;C and we plan to touch base again in the New Year. I wish I had more, but of the dozen elected officials I reached out to he was the only one that got back to me.

The longer I’m out, the older I get, the more the war seems like some distant dream that never happened. Some memories are like they happened yesterday.

I find myself laying in bed at night unable to sleep wondering how the hell I got here. I think I struggle having an identity because going to combat was all I ever wanted to do growing up.

Now I’m 31 and feel like life is so meaningless. I have a wife and a dog, I have a great career, I’m in great shape and look young for my age. I really have no complaints other than everything in life feels so fake, like a giant charade.

Part of me feels like I left my soul in Afghanistan, now I’m a grown man going through the motions of life because I’m ‘supposed’ too. Its hard for me to find ‘purpose’ in anything I do. The only pain I feel is the memories of two dead friends killed in action from my platoon and the thought of my dog dying.

What really throws me off is thinking of how they were 19 &amp; 21 when they were killed, I was 19. We were so young, kids. Its hard to rationalize to myself I survived and my life will keep moving on while theirs was cut so short.

One of the hardest pills for me to swallow is how nobody really cares. I put the USMC and being a combat grunt on such a pedestal growing up. When I was finally in, I felt so much pride. I loved coming home on leave and seeing how proud of me my family was. Now, nobody even asks me about the war, even my family. As time moved on, so did they. I’m safe now and they don’t have to worry about losing a brother or son. I don’t ever talk about the Marines or the military to anyone in my life. I even signed up for the VFW, but in my town there are no combat vets and its hard for me to find common ground with Air Force techs or USCG vets.

My Bn took a ton of casualties over there, including me. Its painful to come to the realization that the average American doesn’t give a shit what we did. I’m not asking for VA disability, parades, etc. I just wish somebody would say ‘Oh man, I heard you fought in Sangin? What was it like over there?’ I’d love to sit down and tell somebody about the change of seasons, how cold it could get, how beautiful it could be too.

can a PL basically tell the cook, yeah, come along so you earn your (CAB? CAR?) don't remember which one it is, or did this only happen in Fob's where the Capt or Lt was in charge of everything and could call a shot like that.

what's stopping a LT basically leaving the base with all the cooks during a patrol?

I ask the question because in my country non infantry are not leaving on infantry missions unless they are part of the operations order where all the names are written of who goes and who doesn't.

follow up question, did the troops during OEF and OIF have to write reports every time they shot a bullet? like did the army keep tabs?

In this first interview with Derl Horn, we go over his early childhood, what led him to the Marines, boot camp at Marine Corp Recruiting Depot San Diego, boot camp stories, being the 'grandpa' of his boot camp platoon, and a married Marine moving to ITR, going to Camp Lejeune and Cuba, and then receiving orders to depart for Vietnam. He would be assigned to the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines (1/9) one of the Marine Corps' most legendary battalions with a history from Bougainville, Guam, and Iwo Jima to numerous operations in South Vietnam along the DMZ. In his time with 1/9, he would partake in numerous combat operations, including Operation Buffalo, where Bravo Company would have 57 Marines killed in one day on 2 July 1967. 

If you are interested in Derl's story stay tuned for more interviews, but you may also purchase Derl's memoir, Blood, Sweat and Honor: Memoirs of a Walking Dead Marine in Vietnam. You can purchase the memoir from Derl directly, where he will mail you a signed copy of his story, or from Amazon. To purchase see the links below:

,USMC,"I’ll start of by saying in no way am I trying to attack prior service recruiters as a whole or to pass off blame, this situation was equally my fault as well.

This situation happened to me a earlier this year and to a couple of my coworkers as well (some were even in different branches). Now it’s currently happening to an old friend.

To explain from the beginning, I had just dropped out of the reserves after a mobilization so I could do a private security contract overseas. I was prior active, only went in the reserves to try it out and I luckily got mobilized to do OAW with the refugee crisis.

I knew my contract was about to be over within 8 months but I had intentions to re-enlist in the IRR for personal reasons. ATM it sounded more simpler, and I was able to do it while in a different country.

Long story short, due to complications, I couldn’t and just decided to move on. Until I was contacted by a prior service recruiter, asking if I wanted to re-up since I only had a month left on my contract.

He basically said he could temporarily drop me in a reserve unit and get an emergency extension and drop me out so I can re enlist in the IRR. Since retention is so bad, he said he does it all of the time.

I explained my situation entirely and how I can’t because I’m working in a different country and I won’t be able to check in the unit or make any drills for a year. He said not to worry, I wouldn’t have to make that months drill or the next because the unit was doing AIT in 29 palms and the next month was a blackout (no drill). He will do all of the work and have me in and out. 

I was skeptical but I was desperate. I did it, he said he would do all of the work. Even comforted me by saying this is all legal cause you definitely have to do this process in person.

Well after he dropped me in and 2 weeks go by with no word, I called him to check in. Basically said he was busy so he pushed me to some E-5 career planner that was fresh to the company, knew him when I was in that same company.

I called the company career planner and he had no idea about my situation so I had to explain everything. He said he’ll take care of my emergency extension and my drop out papers simultaneously so I would have to show up for drill. 

2 more weeks go by and I check in again, he basically said he pushed me to S-1 and gave me their office phone (which didn’t work). I saw what was going on and got pissed. I said fuck it and was just gonna wait until my contract was finished, I had other shit to worry about at the time.

3 months go by and I get a called from this aggressive SSGT accusing me of being UA for like 3-4 months and I explained my situation and he then start throwing more charges like falsifying paper work. Apparently if I didn’t show up immediately they would take away my earned benefits and drop my Honorable discharge. So I naturally freaked out.

I called the company 1 sgt and explained everything and he basically calmed me down, and told me he would set a meeting up with the CO/XO. 

During the meeting it was explained to me that my situation just sounded like a huge communication error and they would work with me. Basically they will just drop me out and forget everything, swept everything under the rug.

Not the type of person to blame everything on the Marine Corps but I really felt used in this situation, like just a body to fill someone’s quota. But I do admit I share complete responsibility in this as well.

I’ll try and make it short and simple, but for this hypothetical scenario:

The US had been at war with a near peer adversary with extensive combat operations around the globe for the past 2 years.

But after accessing your Marines welfare, you can blatantly tell that the war has chipped away at their physical, mental, and spiritual well-being and it has taken a blatant toll on moral and you fear the unit’s combat effectiveness.

On your last patrol, you intercepted an enemy recon patrol and terminated the threat. You task one of your TLs to conduct TSE and they found a supply of pharmaceutical grade methamphetamine tablets on the EKIA. You confiscated them because they might assist you and your squad later.

You’re currently conducting rehearsals with your squad after getting a Warn-O for a company night raid on a heavily fortified compound. You remember the meth tablets and consider supplying them to your troops to further increase their combat effectiveness.

Knowing the legal ramifications and penalty under the UCMJ of caught and the moral/ethical issues with drug use… Do you allow your Marines, under their consent, to take these drugs to further increase their combat effectiveness for this specific mission? Why or why not?

Joined the marine corps at 27(now 31) when at the moment of truth I disclosed  2 “seizures” that I had 2 years prior and never went to the doctors because of lack of medical coverage. I never made it past receiving and eventually got sent home. I had what my doctor called a syncope episode in late 2022 and one in early 2023 and he said it was due to being sunburnt, dehydrated, and drinking alcohol while on vacation. l wasn’t eating healthy then because I wasn’t doing well mentally and coping with unhealthy food and a good amount of alcohol. I have now since stopped and started being healthy again and working out and have been fine. I’ve had an EEG done and results came back normal so nothing neurological. 

I was told when going to medical at parris island that the marine corps is 5 years seizure free without medication can stay or join. 

My question is will the 2 syncope episodes I had and got checked out for disqualifying? Or will I be able to get a waiver. I would like to join a branch before I turn 35 to get that itch to serve taken care of.

He has headaches that occur in random places in his head. Even with meds, he only sleeps 3hrs a night. He's now talking about suicide to resolve.

Please don't come at me for this. Two people with differing opinions and neither of us are in the service. 

Someone served in the marine reserves for around 5 years, give or take. He never went to combat or anything like that, and has no psychological issues from his time in the service. He does from his childhood.

 He was married to a woman and was arrested for hitting her, and somehow honorably discharged. Now several years later he's in jail again for brutally beating his gf woman while under the influence. 

In your opinion, are these the kind of situations that veteran housing is intended for? When he gets out, he will be getting a funded new 1br home to live in.

,USMC,"It’s a novel about PTSD, the persistence of memory, existentialism, and the absurdity of war; written by a guy who was in combat during the Battle of the Bulge, was captured by the Germans, and was a prisoner of war in Dresden during the infamous allied fire bombing of the city. 

It uses science fiction as a framing device and it’s super easy to read; if a bit scattered at times, in classic Vonnegut style. 

This passage really impacted me, and it’s one of many: 

&gt;It was a movie about American bombers in World War II and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this: American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.

&gt;The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers , and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.

&gt;When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas.

To explain from the beginning, I had just dropped out of the reserves after a mobilization so I could do a private security contract overseas. I was prior active, only went in the reserves to try it out and I luckily got mobilized to do OAW with the refugee crisis.

I knew my contract was about to be over within 8 months but I had intentions to re-enlist in the IRR for personal reasons. ATM it sounded more simpler, and I was able to do it while in a different country.

Long story short, due to complications, I couldn’t and just decided to move on. Until I was contacted by a prior service recruiter, asking if I wanted to re-up since I only had a month left on my contract.

He basically said he could temporarily drop me in a reserve unit and get an emergency extension and drop me out so I can re enlist in the IRR. Since retention is so bad, he said he does it all of the time.

I explained my situation entirely and how I can’t because I’m working in a different country and I won’t be able to check in the unit or make any drills for a year. He said not to worry, I wouldn’t have to make that months drill or the next because the unit was doing AIT in 29 palms and the next month was a blackout (no drill). He will do all of the work and have me in and out. 

I was skeptical but I was desperate. I did it, he said he would do all of the work. Even comforted me by saying this is all legal cause you definitely have to do this process in person.

Well after he dropped me in and 2 weeks go by with no word, I called him to check in. Basically said he was busy so he pushed me to some E-5 career planner that was fresh to the company, knew him when I was in that same company.

I called the company career planner and he had no idea about my situation so I had to explain everything. He said he’ll take care of my emergency extension and my drop out papers simultaneously so I would have to show up for drill. 

2 more weeks go by and I check in again, he basically said he pushed me to S-1 and gave me their office phone (which didn’t work). I saw what was going on and got pissed. I said fuck it and was just gonna wait until my contract was finished, I had other shit to worry about at the time.

3 months go by and I get a called from this aggressive SSGT accusing me of being UA for like 3-4 months and I explained my situation and he then start throwing more charges like falsifying paper work. Apparently if I didn’t show up immediately they would take away my earned benefits and drop my Honorable discharge. So I naturally freaked out.

I called the company 1 sgt and explained everything and he basically calmed me down, and told me he would set a meeting up with the CO/XO. 

During the meeting it was explained to me that my situation just sounded like a huge communication error and they would work with me. Basically they will just drop me out and forget everything, swept everything under the rug.

Not the type of person to blame everything on the Marine Corps but I really felt used in this situation, like just a body to fill someone’s quota. But I do admit I share complete responsibility in this as well.

I’ll try and make it short and simple, but for this hypothetical scenario:

The US had been at war with a near peer adversary with extensive combat operations around the globe for the past 2 years.

You’re squad has taken casualties but still combat effective and can still confidently handle anything scenario. But after accessing your Marines welfare, you can blatantly tell that the war has chipped away at their physical, mental, and spiritual well-being and it has taken a blatant toll on moral and you fear the unit’s combat effectiveness.

On your last patrol, you intercepted an enemy recon patrol and terminated the threat. You task one of your TLs to conduct TSE and they found a supply of pharmaceutical grade methamphetamine tablets on the EKIA. You confiscated them because they might assist you and your squad later.

You’re currently conducting rehearsals with your squad after getting a Warn-O for a company night raid on a heavily fortified compound. You remember the meth tablets and consider supplying them to your troops to further increase their combat effectiveness.

My grandfather served with the marines in the pacific in WW2.

He has a big box full of all kinds of medals and other things from his time serving, however, he NEVER spoke to anyone about anything having to do with the war; Just his brothers who also served and my mothers cousin who served in Vietnam.

Things like where he actually fought, any ships that he was maybe assigned to, what division or platoon he was a part of etc. and put it together for her so she can look at everything.

Joined the marine corps at 27(now 31) when at the moment of truth I disclosed  2 “seizures” that I had 2 years prior and never went to the doctors because of lack of medical coverage. I never made it past receiving and eventually got sent home. I had what my doctor called a syncope episode in late 2022 and one in early 2023 and he said it was due to being sunburnt, dehydrated, and drinking alcohol while on vacation. l wasn’t eating healthy then because I wasn’t doing well mentally and coping with unhealthy food and a good amount of alcohol. I have now since stopped and started being healthy again and working out and have been fine. I’ve had an EEG done and results came back normal so nothing neurological. 

I was told when going to medical at parris island that the marine corps is 5 years seizure free without medication can stay or join. 

My question is will the 2 syncope episodes I had and got checked out for disqualifying? Or will I be able to get a waiver. I would like to join a branch before I turn 35 to get that itch to serve taken care of.

,USMC,"It’s a novel about PTSD, the persistence of memory, existentialism, and the absurdity of war; written by a guy who was in combat during the Battle of the Bulge, was captured by the Germans, and was a prisoner of war in Dresden during the infamous allied fire bombing of the city. 

It uses science fiction as a framing device and it’s super easy to read; if a bit scattered at times, in classic Vonnegut style. 

This passage really impacted me, and it’s one of many: 

&gt;It was a movie about American bombers in World War II and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this: American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.

&gt;The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers , and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.

&gt;When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals.

&lt;p&gt;It uses science fiction as a framing device and it’s super easy to read; if a bit scattered at times, in classic Vonnegut style. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passage really impacted me, and it’s one of many: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a movie about American bombers in World War II and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this: American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers , and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again. The American fliers turned in their uniforms, became high school kids. And Hitler turned into a baby.&lt;/p&gt;

,USMC,"I’ll start of by saying in no way am I trying to attack prior service recruiters as a whole or to pass off blame, this situation was equally my fault as well.

This situation happened to me a earlier this year and to a couple of my coworkers as well (some were even in different branches). Now it’s currently happening to an old friend.

To explain from the beginning, I had just dropped out of the reserves after a mobilization so I could do a private security contract overseas. I was prior active, only went in the reserves to try it out and I luckily got mobilized to do OAW with the refugee crisis.

I knew my contract was about to be over within 8 months but I had intentions to re-enlist in the IRR for personal reasons. ATM it sounded more simpler, and I was able to do it while in a different country.

Long story short, due to complications, I couldn’t and just decided to move on. Until I was contacted by a prior service recruiter, asking if I wanted to re-up since I only had a month left on my contract.

He basically said he could temporarily drop me in a reserve unit and get an emergency extension and drop me out so I can re enlist in the IRR. Since retention is so bad, he said he does it all of the time.

I explained my situation entirely and how I can’t because I’m working in a different country and I won’t be able to check in the unit or make any drills for a year. He said not to worry, I wouldn’t have to make that months drill or the next because the unit was doing AIT in 29 palms and the next month was a blackout (no drill). He will do all of the work and have me in and out. 

I was skeptical but I was desperate. I did it, he said he would do all of the work. Even comforted me by saying this is all legal cause you definitely have to do this process in person.

Well after he dropped me in and 2 weeks go by with no word, I called him to check in. Basically said he was busy so he pushed me to some E-5 career planner that was fresh to the company, knew him when I was in that same company.

I called the company career planner and he had no idea about my situation so I had to explain everything. He said he’ll take care of my emergency extension and my drop out papers simultaneously so I would have to show up for drill. 

2 more weeks go by and I check in again, he basically said he pushed me to S-1 and gave me their office phone (which didn’t work). I saw what was going on and got pissed. I said fuck it and was just gonna wait until my contract was finished, I had other shit to worry about at the time.

3 months go by and I get a called from this aggressive SSGT accusing me of being UA for like 3-4 months and I explained my situation and he then start throwing more charges like falsifying paper work. Apparently if I didn’t show up immediately they would take away my earned benefits and drop my Honorable discharge. So I naturally freaked out.

I called the company 1 sgt and explained everything and he basically calmed me down, and told me he would set a meeting up with the CO/XO. 

During the meeting it was explained to me that my situation just sounded like a huge communication error and they would work with me. Basically they will just drop me out and forget everything, swept everything under the rug.

Not the type of person to blame everything on the Marine Corps but I really felt used in this situation, like just a body to fill someone’s quota. But I do admit I share complete responsibility in this as well.

Historians even credit this as one of the reasons why their “Blitzkrieg” warfare was so effective.

I’ll try and make it short and simple, but for this hypothetical scenario:

The US had been at war with a near peer adversary with extensive combat operations around the globe for the past 2 years.

You’re the Squad leader of a very experienced, yet battle fatigued rifle squad that has been conducting various and rigorous missions for the past 2 months and have yet to be rotated out, you have 1 more crucial mission before rotation.

You’re squad has taken casualties but still combat effective and can still confidently handle anything scenario. But after accessing your Marines welfare, you can blatantly tell that the war has chipped away at their physical, mental, and spiritual well-being and it has taken a blatant toll on moral and you fear the unit’s combat effectiveness.

On your last patrol, you intercepted an enemy recon patrol and terminated the threat. You task one of your TLs to conduct TSE and they found a supply of pharmaceutical grade methamphetamine tablets on the EKIA. You confiscated them because they might assist you and your squad later.

You’re currently conducting rehearsals with your squad after getting a Warn-O for a company night raid on a heavily fortified compound. You remember the meth tablets and consider supplying them to your troops to further increase their combat effectiveness.

Knowing the legal ramifications and penalty under the UCMJ of caught and the moral/ethical issues with drug use… Do you allow your Marines, under their consent, to take these drugs to further increase their combat effectiveness for this specific mission? Why or why not?

Petrie just telepathically said to me ""mom, make the voices stop"" and I was immediately completely freaked out and horrified and tried to communicate back with him but everything from then on was garbled in my brain. Then the voices started to tell me things like ""we're poisoning Petrie's mind"" and ""Petrie is ours now"" and ""you don't want to know what we're doing to Otter"" so I don't know if Otter is hearing them too or if they're doing something else horrible to her. I'm devastated and in a state of complete shock and horror and misery right now. I had one job, to protect my babies, and I failed at it and now they're suffering like I suffer. I should have known something was wrong because they've been acting strangely the past few days, meowing a lot more than normal and eating less than normal and sitting where they don't normally sit and wandering around a lot more than they usually do. 

I don't know what to do. I messaged my boyfriend and he said they're fine but couldn't give any reasoning for it, then tried calling my mom but it went straight to voicemail, probably because my parents are on the road down to see my extended family for Christmas right now (which doesn't help matters, because the voices have been saying for days that the CIA is going to orchestrate a car crash on the way that kills them). I just want to curl up in a ball with my poor kitties and cry and hold them tight and tell them not to listen to the evil voices. 

What makes things even worse is that my cats are both microchipped, like I have a microchip in my brain, and the government could be using their microchips to control them as they use mine to control me.

,schizophrenia,"Just want to drop some lines for today is Christmas.

So many of you now sit in a dark place and feel all lost and cast out. Others have a good time today, and we all sit there with the madness or the memories of. It can feel a lot like being discarded and rejected for the pains one has to bear. Like being punished twice for something that wasn't one's fault to begin with.

Well, I just want to tell you all today, don't give yourself up because of that. Don't let people belittle or disregard you because of the experiences you had. These experiences are all valid experiences. They are tough hardship, and even when other people can't see it we all struggle with this hidden suffering and have to get by.

We are all valid survivors of that hardship. We can be proud of getting through that and still being alive. People just have a hard time to recognize - if we were paralyzed, had lost a limb or sight or hearing, then people could recognize our hardship. The hardship we have in the mind they can't see. Some people fail to understand our situations completely, or just fear it too much, others follow an instinct to account the suffering to our persons, and this can really hurt and make one feel alone and lost with the suffering at times.

That's why we have to make up our hearts and realize and accept that this suffering is not visible but still there and valid. This is why people with experience need to stick together and raise awareness. Overcoming barriers of silence and working for the recognition of our pains. Many people already recognize, and understand that we are valid in our struggles. The experiences we have to make...they are the most humbling you can have, the most agonizing, also hard to see from the outside. And this is what makes us especially valid, because nothing makes you tougher and wiser in the end than what we have to go through.

So I want you to take this now into tonight, and try to make it a good night somehow even when others can't see that validity. You know in your heart you're valid and what you've gone through, you know you deserve all respect for that hardship. When others can't see it right, then you have to admit that to yourself.

Even when you're in a dark place, I hope you will not lose trust in life and keep working your way ahead. You know, you don't need to be the uberman to do that. You just need to be open minded and on the look for the chances you have in your life, and then step by step by step making these things real. And it's all there, this world may seem dark at times but the beginnings for trying to make it better are everywhere around us. We just have to look into our heart, around us, and listen to those who bring us the awareness of what we can do to make the best out of our lives still in our bad situation.

You know, there are often things in the way to that. The worst enemy to getting better I found is the thought of expectations that others and the world seems to have from people like us like from everyone. These expectations together with the silence about our pains are what can make us feel so dark at times, with the feeling we could never meet the standards we have to think of. Try to think differently today - we are not in this world, to live up to anyone's expectations, neither the others are there to live up to ours.

We are not really obliged to anything by our heart other than trying to get happy and lucky however we can. Noble is then, when you not only seek your own happiness, but also that of others and take the responsibility for it. This is probably everything our nature truly obliges us to, that's the freedom to follow our heart and learn from wherever it takes us. This is the point, when you realize after dropping some of the expectations you feel pressing you down, that you still can do a lot and follow your dreams and the good things from the present and past you find in your heart. It's all there for us, and whatever we do out of it will be a valid experience, no matter what other people say about it, no matter how many voices are dragging us down. The heart can and will still spark up these dreams for us to take up and follow, and I found, when we take our time and really follow them from heart, they can be stronger than the delusions, they can make us overcome them and reconnect to other people and still find fulfillment in our lives even when we thought all our previous dreams were broken down to shards. This is not just some empty words, but my own experience from more than 20 years with the diagnosis.

So, I hope these words can take some load of someone's chest tonight, and make you feel a little better about the situation. I know this situation can be very bad, but you're not alone with it, and when you just keep going and looking for new beginning you can maybe also find some threads to pick up and weave a new life out of it. It's Christmas today, so do something good for yourself and if you can and dare, also for another one, to bring back some hopes for a new beginning in the next year.

So I wish you all a merry Christmas, or a merry non-Christmas if you chose to reject the santa merchandise...hell, it's your right to do so, to celebrate or not, and it's still special days that you can use to give yourself some space for your heart. Hope you have people around you who make you feel valid, and if you're alone, I wrote this to tell you you're valid nonetheless!",t2_e4d8zb9y,False,,0,False,Schizophrenia is a valid experience,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18pvdtf,False,light,0.91,#0dd3bb,public,18,0,{},,cc4fb44c-b658-11eb-8a8b-0e5d4c19d3b3,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice / Encouragement,False,18,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1703425035.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just want to drop some lines for today is Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many of you now sit in a dark place and feel all lost and cast out. Others have a good time today, and we all sit there with the madness or the memories of. It can feel a lot like being discarded and rejected for the pains one has to bear. Like being punished twice for something that wasn&amp;#39;t one&amp;#39;s fault to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I just want to tell you all today, don&amp;#39;t give yourself up because of that. Don&amp;#39;t let people belittle or disregard you because of the experiences you had. These experiences are all valid experiences. They are tough hardship, and even when other people can&amp;#39;t see it we all struggle with this hidden suffering and have to get by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all valid survivors of that hardship. We can be proud of getting through that and still being alive. People just have a hard time to recognize - if we were paralyzed, had lost a limb or sight or hearing, then people could recognize our hardship. The hardship we have in the mind they can&amp;#39;t see. Some people fail to understand our situations completely, or just fear it too much, others follow an instinct to account the suffering to our persons, and this can really hurt and make one feel alone and lost with the suffering at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why we have to make up our hearts and realize and accept that this suffering is not visible but still there and valid. This is why people with experience need to stick together and raise awareness. Overcoming barriers of silence and working for the recognition of our pains. Many people already recognize, and understand that we are valid in our struggles. The experiences we have to make...they are the most humbling you can have, the most agonizing, also hard to see from the outside. And this is what makes us especially valid, because nothing makes you tougher and wiser in the end than what we have to go through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I want you to take this now into tonight, and try to make it a good night somehow even when others can&amp;#39;t see that validity. You know in your heart you&amp;#39;re valid and what you&amp;#39;ve gone through, you know you deserve all respect for that hardship. When others can&amp;#39;t see it right, then you have to admit that to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when you&amp;#39;re in a dark place, I hope you will not lose trust in life and keep working your way ahead. You know, you don&amp;#39;t need to be the uberman to do that. You just need to be open minded and on the look for the chances you have in your life, and then step by step by step making these things real. And it&amp;#39;s all there, this world may seem dark at times but the beginnings for trying to make it better are everywhere around us. We just have to look into our heart, around us, and listen to those who bring us the awareness of what we can do to make the best out of our lives still in our bad situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, there are often things in the way to that. The worst enemy to getting better I found is the thought of expectations that others and the world seems to have from people like us like from everyone. These expectations together with the silence about our pains are what can make us feel so dark at times, with the feeling we could never meet the standards we have to think of. Try to think differently today - we are not in this world, to live up to anyone&amp;#39;s expectations, neither the others are there to live up to ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not really obliged to anything by our heart other than trying to get happy and lucky however we can. Noble is then, when you not only seek your own happiness, but also that of others and take the responsibility for it. This is probably everything our nature truly obliges us to, that&amp;#39;s the freedom to follow our heart and learn from wherever it takes us.

I'll try keep this short. I have a younger brother who has just come out of a PICU ward and onto a transition ward.

He was expressing symptoms of severe psychosis and mania.

While psychotic he said he was getting thoughts about killing my mum and family.

He's now been medicated and has got day leave from the hospital.

His behaviour is still unnerving towards me, sometimes he'll be speaking coherently and then all of a sudden he'll blank stare at me really intensely.

When this happens I don't know how to react as it feels very uncomfortable. Is this typical behaviour for someone who has just been put on anti psychotics? He was doing this but more intense when he wasn't on medication.

my memory isn't great, but from what i am able to remember i have had visual+audible hallucinations and some strange delusions since 15. there would be days where i would just lay on the floor for hours because the whole room was spinning and many overlapping voices. there would even be days where i wouldn't sleep because i saw a man watching me. im almost 18 now and the voices are becoming more frequent. before it used to be incoherent babbling, but now i can hear them say sentences. they keep asking if i can hear them. i try not to engage because i think that will make them speak more. it's honestly distressing and i don't know what to do from here. 

ive been seeing a therapist and monitoring them and what they are saying. doing this makes me aware of how often they come around. and sometimes thinking about it too much makes them show up more.

 I am non-binary and diagnosed schizophrenic. I feel very certain that I am non-binary, but I just can’t seem to come out to people and insist on my identity. The reasons follow:

 I often feel like I don’t exist. Both in terms of not “representing myself”(?), but also like I *really* am invisible or dead already or just not here or between worlds/dimensions.

,schizophrenia,"      I (15)F was just recently diagnosed with schizophrenia. I have a feeling a lot of people are going to say I'm to young to get the diagnosis, but at this point I'm not even in early stages, I have the symptoms of someone who would have had it for years now. And no obviously it didn't happen over night.
      I've been full on panicking since I got the diagnosis, I feel the hallucinations and delusions have gotten worse bc I can't stop thinking about it. A year of doctors appointments, so many diagnosis. I prepared myself for all the possibilities. When schizophrenia crossed my mind, I didn't really read too much into it. A lot of my problems were blamed on other illnesses and childhood .
     My family sucks at keeping theses things to themselves especially if they could get the attention from other people. Too many people already know. Right now I'm doing online school, but I start public school again in 11ish days. I don't know who I'm supposed to tell or if some students are going to have to know in case I have a episode. I don't want other people to hear and think I'm crazy. I'm not crazy.
      This next part is going to really show the schizophrenia in me, but I'm scared. What if I'm the only real one and I'm in a simulation. And the goal is to not let people take other me. If I get on the medication it will shift my mind. I think the government knows I know too much. I've finally figured out what they've been doing. Or what if I'm not real and everyone else is. Maybe I'm a clone. I am a remake of somebody else who died. Is my brain my own??
      I have so many superstitions. I really do think I know to much and I don't know who to trust. Nothing feels real anymore. I know I haven't always been like this but I can't remember what it was like when I wasn't. Why can't I be normal. Why do I have to be the one to fight against the government. 
      Honestly at this point it's making me want to relapse on self harm or suicide. I just want to feel real. And if I am schizophrenic, I know I will be put into an institution eventually, and I don't want to go to places like that anymore. 
      If you've read my last posts, I've been in mental hospitals bc they were trying to see why I was the way I am.
      This is really hard to accept because I've had big dreams and everything is going down hill. Do any of you have schizophrenia or help people who do? I really need some advice and maybe just some details on what my life could look like from now.

,schizophrenia,"I've been diagnosed with psychosis but I don't know if it's full-blown schizophrenia or a schizoaffective disorder.

I'll try to keep it short. I think there are cameras in my wall and I think I saw a lense once. I'm scares of mirrors and they must be avoided or faced away from me if possible. I think people are always watching me. Always following me. When I hear laughing, it's about me. The government knows I have powers. I am a god, an alien, or an angel. I think everything has a meaning and an constantly trying to decipher it. Back in 2021-2022, I became obsessed with spirit numbers, 111 and 333 and 222 and so on. I would hallucinate these numbers. I would see blobs of color and messages in the air. They were meant for me. I'd also see random words and numbers. I see shadow faces and sparkles of white. I have visual snow syndrome though, so it could be that.

I have horrible mood swings. I sleep for 11-14 hours each night. I've been irritable my whole life but it's getting worse. I'm so on edge. My therapist said I have stress and anxiety that is so bad, my body has normalized it to the point where I can't discern it. I used to have false memories and extremely vivid dreams that I thought were memories. I had severe ocd and would wear multiple layers of gloves, wash my hands until they bled, and when it was really bad, I couldn't breathe a certain way or wouldn't touch a certain part of my bedframe while I slept. I would apologize to God and sob over the Bible. I'd force myself to smile. I'd pour bleach on my skin. I'd shower for hours. Laundry became a 5-hour process because I had to move clothes a certain way. It was hell.

Along with ocd, I've also been diagnosed with autism, schizoid pd, depression, anxiety, panic attack disorder, and we suspect I have ADHD.

Mentally, I feel like a child. I was born into a household that was a quiet type of abusive. I thought it was fine, but my adolescence was horrible. My parents were strict and gave me trauma that I suppressed.

Now my memory is bad. I forget things after a few seconds and I take it to mean my brain is trying to protect me by rejecting unnecessary information.

Right now, I have a hard time socializing. I can't speak right. I stutter and say the wrong words. I can't type right. I'm a writer but my hands will sometimes type the wrong thing that my brain thinks.

I don't know. Is this schizophrenia? I've been through 8 therapists and they say it's severe anxiety mixed with autism and ocd. I'm planning to meet with my psychiatrist soon to discuss meds. I'm on Zoloft and Abilify bit it's not helping. I've tried so many meds.

I've never taken drugs, so this is likely stress-related. Is it schizophrenia? It's really ruining my life. And would anyone recommend some coping strategies? Please don't say meditation. It's too hard for me.

TRIGGER WARNING: these paragraphs contain suicide and self harm

My aunt (40F) used to be such a happy person. She loved hanging out with me and we used to have so much fun together.

She’s getting worse. When she was just diagnosed with schizophrenia she couldn’t really talk to me she was just kinda staring into space.

She has a voice in her head and the voice in her head is Jesus. Jesus tells her that she is in a relationship with him. 

She tried to break up with her husband because she doesn’t want to be unloyal to Jesus. She has committed the 1st suicide attempt by an overdose to be with Jesus. When it didn’t work she was set to hospital and I saw her face it was completely purple. When it didn’t work she tried cutting herself and trying to hit a major artery

She tells me and my family who’s going to heaven and hell because Jesus has told her, apparently I’m going to heaven and her parents are going to hell.

She has tried to commit suicide once again and she got sent to a mental hospital which she has escaped multiple times and ran out bare foot. 

I just hate to see her struggling and my cousins are her children, I feel really bad for them to see their mother in such a bad way.

So my aunt can’t spend Christmas with her family and I just feel so awful for her. I know it’s for a good reason tho.

I just needed to get this out because I’ve been crying so much because I care about her as she’s cared about my many years, we used to be so close and she’s not herself anymore she used to be so bubbly and happy and o went to visit her and she’s as skinny as anything she looks so poorly ",t2_lw5gltnb4,False,,0,False,My aunt has schizophrenia and she’s really getting worse,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18p8hgf,False,light,1.0,,public,13,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger Warning,False,13,,False,False,,1703355213.0,,[],{},,True,,1703346709.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is more a vent because I’m really worried about her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any thoughts let me know. I would love to hear some perspectives. Did you have any to decide on anything? I really want to move on in life.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hey everyone, I just made this account to ask a question that’s been on my mind that my psych hasn’t helped me address yet. I looked over the about section and FAQs so I hope I didn’t miss anything that would violate the guidelines! I am also on the mobile site so I apologize for any weird formatting errors.

To start, I am not diagnosed with schizophrenia but I am diagnosed bipolar and harm-type OCD. I am on two different medications to treat these respective diagnoses, but my OCD meds are anti-psychotics that are very rarely ever prescribed for OCD and are more common for schizophrenia and symptoms that relate to such. These meds do help, but I think my psych is a bit lost on “what” I might actually be. 

The reason I say this is because I experience (what I think are) delusions, although my descriptions of such might sound more like hallucinations. (Trigger Warning Ahead) It starts when I become very paranoid that there are bugs in my walls (a big OCD trigger for me) and devolves into me “seeing” the walls moving or pulsating to the motions of the bugs or “hearing” the bugs moving in them. The reason for the quotes is because I’m not sure that I “see” or “hear” these as much as I sort of feel them doing that, if that makes sense. Once I hit this stage, I can either stay in that paranoid/delusional state or it can worsen and I become much more paranoid about other things— like people following me, trying to hurt me, or that bugs have now spread to anything I touch. Basically I don’t feel safe anywhere, even my feet touching the ground or any surface makes me want to vomit or scream, and I don’t trust anyone around me, even my partner who I very much love. 

I guess I’m just wondering how you can tell the difference between hallucinations and delusions? I think I do “see” or “hear” things, but I’ve heard people who are diagnosed with schizophrenia describe auditory or visual hallucinations and they seem much more intense than what I experience. 

I know this is a general question but any insight would be super appreciated, especially because I’m kind of anxious about talking to my psych more deeply about it. Usually when I bring it up, she opts to up my meds and the conversation ends there.

,schizophrenia,"Does anyone else here find the mornings the most difficult part of the day? 

I used to love mornings but lately they're quite challenging. 

I think it might be because my night-time Risperidone has worn off and my morning dose needs a bit of time to kick in, but I always find the first few hours of the day the hardest. It mostly seems to be my energy levels that are affected, I just feel slow and dead in the mornings, but I also feel more anxious and sometimes a little paranoid depending on the day. 

It almost feels like each day I have a mountain to climb, I start off the mountain feeling crappy, then over the first couple of hours of the day I climb up to alright, then by hour 4-5 or so I'm feeling decent, and on good days by hour 7-9 I'll be feeling *good*. Once I'm there I usually stay there for the rest of the day until something happens to throw off my mood, which means every night I'm always dreading going to sleep, because in the night I'm feeling pretty good usually, but at the same time I know the good feeling I have will be gone again in the morning and I'll have to make the climb again.

It's one of the reasons I'm struggling to give up smoking again because in the past I started off weaning off the cigarettes by delaying my morning cigarette as long as possible - but recently my mornings have been rough and those first couple of cigarettes feel like the one thing getting me through it.

,schizophrenia,"hi all,

i’m a fictional author and always trying to include diverse representation in my books. my current work-in-progress is a romance told from the POV of the female main character who falls for the male main character who has schizophrenia. The book is not about the MMC’s schizophrenia, but it is a rather small subplot which i want to be as accurate as possible.

I’ve read through this subreddit a LOT and I have a few unanswered questions:

For those of you that are medicated/in therapy, what are your day to day “symptoms” (forgive me if this is poor terminology)?

Those of you in relationships, what are the best ways your partners have supported you? (Or ways that partners made things harder for you?)

&amp; any other advice I should know? (i.e. poor representations you’ve seen before/things I should avoid?) 

I appreciate this greatly. I can read all day in the DSM-5 or in research journals, but nothing is better than advice straight from the very people I’m attempting to represent. 

To those who reply, if the book gets published (I’m optimistic that it will, but in traditional publishing you never really know), any comments that I utilize in creating this story will get a PM upon completion &amp; I’ll send you a free copy of the novel :)))

Thanks, friends.

,schizophrenia,"Hello,

I don’t know if I have this post tagged right, I apologize if it’s not.  I have some questions and I could really use some advice from people who have experience.

My partner recently had a pretty severe psychotic episode with delusions and hallucinations that landed him in the hospital.  We previously thought he had bipolar disorder, but the doctors thought otherwise after what they observed.  He was communicating to aliens, god, getting messages from tv shows, among other things.  He claimed he was channeling aliens, angels, demons.  Yelling in loud voices and shaking around, laughing hysterically at random points.  Then he’d just stare and not respond, occasionally shaking his head or nodding, chuckling — he was communicating with them, he said.  He’d go through periods of really intense negative emotion, happiness, and no emotion — according to him.  At one point he said he was channeling my spirit that was a demon trying to turn into an angel.  Eventually it subsided to a point that was less outwardly visible, but says the aliens/angels are testing him and making him a better person.  They told him not to lie and are making him tell me things that he has been lying to me about for like over 10 years.  I don’t want to go into details, but I’m reeling because I remember the incidents he’s telling me and remember thinking he was lying to me at the time.  I feel sick and feel like I’m in shock.

My question is, I guess — is it possible for his delusions to cause him to become more honest, like compulsively almost, because he says they’re making him a better person and making him tell the truth?  I’m so confused right now.  And the mood swings and staring off into the distance and not responding are scaring me.

He has an appointment with his psychiatrist soon.  He still doesn’t know what’s going on and I don’t think he can really consider that he could be sick.  I’m not sure how to help him right now.  I have a mental illness myself and I feel like I’m losing my sanity.

I’m not judging him, I realize this is rough.  I feel so bad for him.  :(

,schizophrenia,"Hi guys,  


I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia 6/7 years ago, I had awful delusions and hallucations, I didn't know what was real and what wasn't, my whole personality changed to try and face the new 'reality' that I was living in. However, with a combination of CBT, Ariprazole, Risperidone and Quetiapine (Not al at once, jesus) I managed to crawl my way out of the delusions, and the hallucinations without the delusions are an irritant at worst.  


But I'm still struggling with the negative symptoms 4/5 years later, I thought the emotional issues were potentially a defence mechanism that my brain would eventually repair, but they're still occuring.   


Let me describe what I'm experiencing now:

  
\- Incredibly low ""social battery"", after 30-60 minutes of conversation, my social battery feels completely empty, I can't think of things to say, I can't join in on any jokes, I pretty much go completely non-verbal for 30 minutes until I recharge, in a group this is fine, but 1 on 1 it makes for pretty awkward situations  


\- Emotional blunting/severe apathy, unless I'm intoxicated, I don't feel any emotion towards what people say or do, I don't get defensive, I don't get upset, I don't get offended, I don't find things funny, I don't express gratitude or love properly, I don't express concern etc. Outwardly I can still express these emotions in pantomine, but some people see straight through me and I can come across as fake or ingenuine. Before the schizophrenia I was a very emotionally intelligent and outwardly displaying person, but now I feel like a borderline psychopath emotionally.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sleep issues, I have never been able to sleep correctly, and can only sleep when I'm on brink of passing out from exhaustion. I've managed to get a 12-8 shift at my 9-5 to allow me to fall asleep at 4/5am without major consequence, but I would like to get some insight on this, and see if it's a result of the negative symptoms or just a personal thing, as I've had trouble with sleep ever since I was a child  


I would be interested to know if anybody has faced these same negative symptoms, and potential solutions to properly mitigate them. The fact that I tend to be okay emotionally when I'm intoxicated makes me think there's some sort of psychological block there, but on the other hand, the increased confidence could just improve my self deception. Either way, this tends to make me use alcohol and substances as a crutch when socialising, which I could do without.

,schizophrenia,"Hello,

My wife has noticed I have good and bad cycles. Ups and Downs. During the downs I’m very withdrawn, inward, and suspicious. During the ups I’m just pretty normal. 

She’s noticed some signs about to have a down. I thought this was interesting and just wanted to share.

1) I’ll get very opinionated and argumentative 

2) I stop really focusing on the current and new and focus more on like existing I guess? Idk she said I get really philosophical and interested in the way the universe is swirling around me and like brushing my teeth. 

3) I either stop eating as much or eat way more. During an up I’ll eat pretty healthy and a lot of different things. When I’m down I eat more hearty comfort meals and nostalgic things that remind me of my childhood.

4) I will do things that bring me a lot of comfort. I’ll start the harry potter series over or lord of the rings. When I’m good I’ll seek out new books.

5) I’ll get really religious when I’m starting to decline too.

,schizophrenia,"I want to preface by saying I currently see a psychiatrist for different things (ASD,ADHD,GAD and MDD). I also have background knowledge in the topic. 

I will also preface, I am NOT looking for a diagnosis or expecting a “magic answer” I’m just looking to compare experiences , familiarities, hear stories etc , to better make sense of my situation. 

Post: 


For the last 6-12 months I have been having lingering depression, which as per my MDD and ASD is not a foreign concept. However this recent period of depression has been without the normal mood components, no suicidal ideation no loss of self worth etc, they are all anhedonia, lethargy and poor self care related + executive dysfunction. I’ve been distancing myself and not wanting any interactions apart from necessary ones (not bizarre given my Autism but it’s more frequent, also could just be burnout).. 

During this time my anxiety has been playing up, when I go to the gym I am paranoid everyone is looking at me and talking about me, staring at me and laughing at me. 

This also happens at work , where I think people are laughing at me, communicating between eachother non verbally and don’t like me. 

At times I also periodically get paranoid my neighbours can see me showering and I sometimes hear noises resembling that thought (window opening, lock noise or a laugh). (Rarely). 

I also get anxious about my air con vent that someone is looking through it (however this was prominent in my teens and was severe so I slept under the blanket for months). 

I have also been noticing more visual illusions, by this I mean in my peripheral vision I sometimes see objects that will periodically take a shape of a person until I look at them centrally and it’s normal. Or sometimes I’ll see floating dots around. (My vision and eye health is fine as per the optometrist) Sometimes I get paranoid I may have seen a human figure too until I look at “them” and it’s nothing or a door for example. (These have been getting more frequent, I’m aware illusions are normal but with their increasing frequency and “severity”)..  they also sometimes take the form of just being shadow spots or a sensation someone has walked behind me.

When walking to my car at night I sometimes get paranoid I’m being followed and sometimes think I hear foot steps following me (assuming this could be an anxiety response). 

Very recently I’ve started laughing out loud to thoughts that come into my head, and sometimes my thoughts just don’t make sense, the other day I made a joke in my mind I was the beacon of truth- that made me laugh out loud lol. (This could also be a self soothing thing with my ASD). 

Further , I’ve been having increasing Deja vu , like every day sometimes multiple times a day. Like a situation or string of words was something that happened before , and preceded a bad event or something bad happening. Almost like a sense of doom but mild.

How was everyone else’s prodrome? Any comparisons/similarities? 

I am aware these symptoms could also overlap with burnout from my ASD, anxiety exacerbating these concerns and my depression being in the background. (? MDD with psychotic features etc). 

I was intrigued at Schizophrenia due to reading a few study’s of the slightly increased % of ASD people in likelihood to develop schizophrenia.

&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a mental illness I live with, but it is not who I am. I define myself through my own actions and realize I can’t be perfect all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel what I feel, see what I hear. Gruesome thoughts horrific sounds, none of this will weigh me down. King in my mind is what I need to find, give me a sign of the divine and free my soul ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"I don't necessarily mean naming the individual voices (although by all means, feel free to share). I have come to learn that saying you ""hear voices"" can be off-putting to people, so I was thinking of giving mine a nickname. Something like the Peanut Gallery, or my passengers, backseat drivers, haters, fan club, etc.

Idk, it just seems like there's a stigma against people who hear voices and sometimes I want to talk to others about it without them being uncomfortable and not knowing how to respond.

There have also been times when I've said things to friends or family about severe hallucinations and delusions I was experiencing that are uncomfortable and serious topics, the nature of which makes it difficult to explain or open up about.

My thoughts was that it would be easier to talk about if I didn't use such ""scary"" language, and to talk about my experiences in a way that makes it easier to empathize with.

So how do you talk about it, and does that help? Also, for those of you who communicate with your voices, how does the way you refer to and treat them help you manage them and cope with what they're saying?

For example, when the voices become overwhelmingly difficult to ignore, I tend to go full mockery mode and make fun of my loudmouths any way I can think of. Sometimes it riles them up and they'll get frustrated, other times they're very insistent on telling me whatever they think will upset me the most. 

Having to manage my voices has become incredibly disruptive to my life, and I'm struggling to even do that when I live in isolation, no one to speak with about it whatsoever (even when I was briefly seeing a therapist, since i never got to talk about it). And that isn't even to mention the fact that I also hear persecutory voices when I see people in public, every time I pass someone by or turn away from them. Still don't know how to deal with that other than confront them and ask them to repeat what they just said (which is obviously the wrong thing to do about it).

,schizophrenia,"  

A pair of twins were brought up in a Christian home where it was strongly recommended to respect the law and stay away from smoking, drinking alcohol and doing drugs.

Both were brough up blessed having parents that could provide them with necessities and some luxuries. They both went to a private high school. They played hockey for about 7 years, they did triathlons, swimming competitions, passed their alpine skiing instructor class, and were lifeguards on a pool.

The older brother did a good job of complying reasonably with their parents’ recommendations, however the younger one didn’t. The older brother obtained two bachelor’s degrees, a master’s degree and went on to live the American Dream. With wealth, health and fitness, he went on to achieve many accomplishments and obtained good fortune.

The younger brother who didn’t obey his parents consumed recreational drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol abundantly, quit school, developed paranoid schizophrenia, and lived close to a decade on welfare.

The older brother achieved the steps on the track to the American Dream pretty much in a straight, orderly and legal line, while the younger one, as he developed the illness, wandered off the track, explored the unknown and pranced around in off-road fields doing things that were not understood and that were considered as a waste of time.

One day, the younger twin asked for divine intervention at the right place. The same year, he was prescribed efficient medication. One year later, he had a minimum wage part-time job. Two years later, he had a diploma and a full-time job. Four years after that, he had a wife, a car and a condo. Today he is happily married, homeowner and on his way in his 11th year working full-time at a stable job.

To those of you who don’t believe in God, what do you make of this?

&lt;p&gt;Both were brough up blessed having parents that could provide them with necessities and some luxuries. They both went to a private high school. They played hockey for about 7 years, they did triathlons, swimming competitions, passed their alpine skiing instructor class, and were lifeguards on a pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The older brother did a good job of complying reasonably with their parents’ recommendations, however the younger one didn’t. The older brother obtained two bachelor’s degrees, a master’s degree and went on to live the American Dream. With wealth, health and fitness, he went on to achieve many accomplishments and obtained good fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The younger brother who didn’t obey his parents consumed recreational drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol abundantly, quit school, developed paranoid schizophrenia, and lived close to a decade on welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The older brother achieved the steps on the track to the American Dream pretty much in a straight, orderly and legal line, while the younger one, as he developed the illness, wandered off the track, explored the unknown and pranced around in off-road fields doing things that were not understood and that were considered as a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, the younger twin asked for divine intervention at the right place. The same year, he was prescribed efficient medication. One year later, he had a minimum wage part-time job. Two years later, he had a diploma and a full-time job. Four years after that, he had a wife, a car and a condo. Today he is happily married, homeowner and on his way in his 11th year working full-time at a stable job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To those of you who don’t believe in God, what do you make of this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m doing better since I&amp;#39;ve been out of work, but I&amp;#39;m still hella anxious. My symptoms have gotten better after switching to Abilify, but my meds make me dizzy and sick, so I&amp;#39;m afraid my doctor might want to switch meds again. Switching medications is always scary for me. I&amp;#39;ve ended up hospitalized during a med change. It&amp;#39;s not something I want to go through again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find doing things like showering, getting dressed, etc are becoming harder to do. I&amp;#39;m so upset all the time and I hate it. I need to pull myself out of this downward spiral. I&amp;#39;m doing all the things..going to therapy classes..taking my meds..keeping up with appointments.. I&amp;#39;m so good at masking. I&amp;#39;m afraid to tell my friends and family the truth about how hopeless I feel and how I&amp;#39;m passively suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"I (30F) and my boyfriend (41M) have been having problems in our relationship. We will refer to my boyfriend as Peter from now on. We have been together for the past 2 years and a half. Peter is a very sensitive and empathetic person and I love him a lot but he is severely burnt out mentally. He is the main caregiver along with his aging mother for his schizophrenic brother (30M), let’s call him Tom. My boyfriend lives to take care of Tom financially and emotionally, he says this is main duty in life. Anything that Tom needs Peter does not hesitate to get as he loves his brother deeply and just wants him to have a normal as possible life. Tom is very functional meaning he can complete everyday tasks but lacks awareness that he suffers from schizophrenia. He has been to the psychiatrist and yet still does not believe the diagnosis, does not acknowledge this and thus does not take his anti-psychotic medication. Peter has resorted to putting his medication in his food to control his symptoms which he feels very conflicted and horrible about. This diagnosis was a few years ago. Tom stays at home all day because he does not work, he did not complete his bachelor’s degree as he suffered a psychotic break and was unable to study, thus he spends a lot of time at home on the internet and he smokes around 2 packs of cigarettes per day. He also smokes cannabis which intensifies his behavior where he gets in negative moods and his negative delusions increase. Tom has a lot of delusions of unrealistic ideas e.g. he says he is a therapist and him talking to people means that he has had experience in therapy thus he is a therapist and he has also created an Only Fans in a manic state and does not remember doing so and posting explicit pictures.

Peter is emotionally burnt out as he spends a lot of time talking to his brother trying to reason with him which can go on for hours every day about all his ideas and things he wants to do or courses he wants to pursue. Tom also has a habit of pursuing courses he is unable to complete because he feels much unfilled that he did not complete his degree and is trying to compensate. My boyfriend in turn has to pay for these courses which are sometimes expensive and if he does not pay for it Tom becomes very agitated and unhappy. Peter has tried telling Tom multiple times about his diagnosis but he still refuses to acknowledge this and becomes very angry when this discussion is brought up.

Initially for around the 1st few months of Peter’s and I relationship, I used to spend a lot of time at his house and we would do normal couple things like watch movies, eat together or just spend time together in general. Peter was hesitant to introduce me to Tom initially but we also formed a good relationship. I spent a lot of time talking to Tom about different topics in general and his interests mostly, as he doesn’t have much interest in anything else besides what he wants to talk about. Tom however began to have a problem that I was spending more time with Peter than him. Tom and I are similar ages and he began to compare himself to me academically and financially. For reference Tom and I attended similar schools and we were both academically inclined. I completed my bachelor’s degree and began working soon after, I have a normal 9-5 and he has told Peter that I remind him of all the things he did not accomplish academically. He said that it was hard to be around me because I am a constant reminder of what he did not accomplish. I have never ever flaunted my academics or job and or acted in any way but Tom has built this his reality that I am a sore reminder that he is a failure and that he feels horrible around me. He has also commented on the age gap between Peter and me that it is weird that he and I are similar in ages and that Peter is so much older. Tom also began to have an issue with Peter and spending time together because that I should be talking to him instead. This also contradicts the part where he doesn’t want to be around me because my presence makes him feel less than but that I should talk to him more than Peter.

Eventually it reached a point where I had to stop coming to the house in order to not make Tom uncomfortable. Peter and I are still in a relationship but Tom does not know about it. Peter has told him I had to stop coming to the house because Tom indicated it made him uncomfortable and thus Tom believes we are not in a relationship anymore. It is sometimes stressful for both of us because Tom consistently asks Peter his whereabouts and is consistently checking up on him to see where he is. This in turn stresses Peter as he feels he is being deceitful and in turn it is difficult for me as we don’t spend time together. The most time we spend together is about 2 hours every week as we do not see each other on the weekdays during work as it’s more difficult for Peter to explain where he is.

This may seem strange from the outside looking in as Peter does not need to explain his decision but please bear in mind that Tom in mentally unwell and the way he views things is not through the same perspective as a so-called ‘normal person’. Peter is mostly at home with Tom so that Tom is not alone or has someone to talk to as Tom consistently needs to voice whatever is going on in his head. Tom does not have many friends he can talk to and has isolated himself from family as he also compares himself to family similar in age and what they have accomplished. I have voiced my opinion on what the future for Peter and I may hold as things don’t seem to be changing for the better. Also how is Peter going to explain this in a case we were to get married to Tom that we were still carrying on a relationship all this time? Also Peter has made it clear he has to live in the family home to take care of Tom so how would you explain this? It’s very difficult for Peter to be there for me emotionally as he is consistently worried about Tom and his sometimes unpredictable behavior as this has really worn him out after all these years. This has also affected his last relationship. I do not fault Peter as he is a wonderful guy but I don’t feel fulfilled or see things changing anything soon for us to spend more time as this is a serious issue that Peter cannot control. Any advice, I’m really hurting here as I would never want Peter to think I have abandoned him because of his situation, I try to support him as best as I can emotionally but it’s really taking a toll on me. Peter also suffers from severe depression because of the situation and burnout and I in turn have not been doing well mentally.

Also how is Peter going to explain this in a case we were to get married to Tom that we were still carrying on a relationship all this time? Also Peter has made it clear he has to live in the family home to take care of Tom so how would you explain this? It’s very difficult for Peter to be there for me emotionally as he is consistently worried about Tom and his sometimes unpredictable behavior as this has really worn him out after all these years. This has also affected his last relationship. I do not fault Peter as he is a wonderful guy but I don’t feel fulfilled or see things changing anything soon for us to spend more time as this is a serious issue that Peter cannot control. Any advice, I’m really hurting here as I would never want Peter to think I have abandoned him because of his situation, I try to support him as best as I can emotionally but it’s really taking a toll on me. Peter also suffers from severe depression because of the situation and burnout and I in turn have not been doing well mentally. Any thoughts or advice please.&lt;/p&gt;

He says he been watching deviant porn before being on meds years back, but it was exacerbated with smoking weed (which hes done for 2 years and stopped in 2013)
He got the abilify maintena injection (LAI) he felt clear headed the first 5 days with no porn cravings. However the cravings now have gradually resurfaced to his mind its day 6 now since the LAI. He feels clear headed with decent eye contact, a bit anxious of what he did yesterday. 
Abilify is a good medication but is the hypersexuality caused by the med or God forbids it’s just him. I am thinking of suggesting to switch to invega LAI that gets rid of the craving and ecstatic behavior on porn web, however it lowers the lobido (doesnt mind that) and you cant ejaculate semen while on it (so how is he going to create a family on it) makes him less dynamic in his thinking and he is slower when talking in his second language.

,schizophrenia,"Hi everyone, and thank you in advance for any advice.

I am in the US. My brother was hospitalized involuntarily on the 24th (Sunday). He is now on a 10 day hold. He will not take meds on his own, and is not med compliant in these scenarios. His symptoms are very severe right now, to the point where he is not able to recognize our parents. 

If they can get him stable enough to have a cohesive conversation I would love to tell him that if he is compliant he can at least choose what medication he is on, but if he continues to be noncompliant he will be forcibly medicated with whatever the doctor deems appropriate, with a long acting med. This has happened in the past.

He signed a HIPPA release for my mom to talk to the doctors (which is amazing considering he could not recognize her) so she may be able to say “please don’t give him X, try X instead.”

In the past he’s been given risperadone and more recently they put him on haldol, which he seemed ok on but very depressed although that’s unfortunately expected.

I’m wondering if someone is forcibly medicated if the schizophrenic community has any preferred vs. less preferred choices of the long acting meds. I wish he would comply because that way he can choose which meds to try and adjust the dose etc., but unfortunately that’s just not going to be the case in this instance.

TL:DR - if someone is going to be court ordered/forcibly medicated, what are the best choices and what should be avoided?

,schizophrenia,"tw: suicide


my beautiful boyfriend took his own life after his very intense battle with schizophrenia. he always struggled with mental illness but didn't start having delusions/psychotic episodes until this year. he was hospitalized twice and then a week after his second stay, he died. it was very gory and i never ever would have thought he would have taken his life in /that/ way.

i have a few questions about some of his delusions/just general things he did. i have tried so hard to educate myself on schizophrenia since his diagnosis and after his passing.

maybe it's more like describing things he did than they are questions.

-he was very much convinced that he was black/latino when in reality he was very white lol. he drove a black car and said that white cars were racist and that they hated him because he was in a black car

-he drove very erratically and eventually was no longer allowed to drive because he was constantly nearly getting us into accidents. he would weave in and out of vehicles, get over on top of them, speed, run lights, etc.

-he was obsessed with gang culture. he loved this movie called blood in blood out. talked about it all the time and seemed inspired by it.

-only listened to rap music (literally no problem but he has always been more of a post punk kinda guy)

-suddenly a born again catholic (he grew up baptist but always identified as agnostic). i know that those with schizophrenia can often become religious without any previous interest.

-always told me he could smell when i was ovulating. became obsessed with women's cycles.

-believed that swingers were out to get him and wanted to r*pe him.

there's probably so much more i never even witnessed. one time his friends took him to a movie and said that they heard him whispering to himself and then holding out the letter ""c"" with his hands and telling them it stood for comfort.

i asked him several times if he heard voices. i'm assuming he was lying when he told me no.

the last few days of his life he basically went nonverbal, could only pace my apartment, and was terrified someone was out to get him. i found out after taking him home to his mom's that he didn't take his meds the entire time he was in my home. i asked him every morning if he did and he lied. i feel so guilty and his family won't speak to me. i don't really know what i'm looking to achieve by posting here. maybe some insight? he was only 25. i miss him so, so much.

he didn't live with me and we saw each other few times a week. i had to drive two hours each way to bring him to my place and take him home or just spend time at his mom's.

he had no car, barely had a job, no friends in the area, had to move home and drop out of college. i can only imagine the pain and stress he was dealing with.",t2_2vmpuol3,False,,0,False,my boyfriend was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and died a month ago,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18roisc,False,light,0.98,,public,65,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger Warning,False,65,,False,False,,1703700933.0,,[],{},,True,,1703641602.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;tw: suicide&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"I (27F), want to start by saying I am not diagnosed as schizophrenic, I do not believe I am schizophrenic, and I am not looking to be arm chair diagnosed as schizophrenic.

I have OCD, ADHD and possibly bipolar (hypomanic symptoms).

For several years I have felt I can talk to God. No, I don't hear his voice, he doesn't speak to me auditorily, I don't see him. But I would get a lot of signs from the universe and was able to speak to him in a way and get a response. I never spoke to a therapist about this because this is something I quite enjoyed and never thought of as weird.

I was put on Strattera for my ADHD last year. Since then, God has stopped talking to me. It doesn't even make sense because there is no reason to believe Strattera would stop delusions, and it has even been known to induce psychosis in some people.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know whether these were spiritual delusions or not, but I sort of feel maybe they were. It upsets me nothing my once close relationship to God may have all just been in my head. I want to feel close to God and talk to him again, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm just delusional. I felt my spirituality was a huge aspect of my identity and I've lost that part of me. And I feel stupid knowing I would proudly tell people about talking to God, and 'you too can speak to God.' Like obviously I sounded psychotic to these people.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anybody else on this forum felt sad or empty after losing some delusions? Anybody else dealing with something similar? Any advice on how to get my relationship with God back without feeling crazy?

I didn&amp;#39;t realize the sun was setting so early, it&amp;#39;s getting dark and I really hate walking through the woods at night esp by myself so I&amp;#39;m probably just gonna chill here and procrastinate it a bit, at least until the moon comes out and there&amp;#39;s some light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to chat on discord but we can talk in the comments too. I&amp;#39;m kind of getting paranoid bc I&amp;#39;m in a small town and I&amp;#39;m kind of like a free spirit alternative looking individual so everyone looks at me weird or just avoids eye contact and I feel like I&amp;#39;m being watched&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t believe the word is simulated by a computer but I believe that it exists in the mind of the Godhead/ the one. The numbers feel like codes of some kind and I don’t know it’s the will of heaven that I’m drawn to obess over them or it’s just my illness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I made sense I know I tend to make word salads.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hello. I am 28. Male. 5'6''. 67 Kg / 148 lbs. Non smoker. Non-drinker. Indian. 

So all this begun in 2013. I was feeling unusually relaxed despite critical test that I was about to appear for. Fast forward 2 months I performed very badly in the test and barely passed. After getting admission in not-so-good college I had episodes of extreme anxiety over high tension wires that was in the locality of my college. You have to pass below those towers to get to the college. I was so scared that i tried to get in other colleges or leave engineering altogether and choose different career option. I was then taken to a career counsellor where they concluded that civil services was actually a better option for me instead of engineering. There the counsellor convinced me to continue engineering and later appear for civil services examination after graduating from engineering college.

 I was convinced and I continued with my engineering career. In 2016 I remember two events that could contribute to my current predicament. One was doing a horrible sin / crime for which I did not at the time feel any remorse. It was after my brother found out about the same I was in shock for a whole evening. The second event involves  me watching a trailer to Bollywood movie which caused sort of existential crisis in me after which I started to read up on religion and spirituality. After graduating in 2017 I was left with question of what to do next. Over the next few years I had similar experiences where my I felt hyperventilated, i felt as if I was naked (despite wearing usual clothing) and my private part was chopped off and my heart had gone weak while surfing the web. My vitamin d3 is 70 ng/ml and b12 is 950 pg/ml. Because I am convinced my illness is because nutritional deficiency I take 2 multivitamins, 1 antioxidant capsule, 1 iron supplement, 1 B-complex capsule, 2 magnesium 200 mg, milk (for calcium), 1/4 zinc acetate (25 mg) On and Off since 6 months. Stopped D3 and B12 after testing and getting high results. I used to take High Dosage supplements for those too for a suspected deficiency. I have been to dozens of medical professionals since 2016 and their diagnosis is schizophrenia, depression and anxiety.

My initial symptoms (since 2019 heart collapse feeling episode) were :

* Feeling restless and weak hearted and spaced out
* experience of life feels shallower than before
* Feels like I am living on autopilot
* Mind feels unusually blank most of time
* thoughts are not vivid as they were before
* Decreased alertness
* Decreased attention
* Brain Fog
* Zoned out most of the time
* Decreased concentration.
* Decreased cognitive abilities
* Decreased mental Faculties
* Confusion 

&amp;#x200B;

After the cocktail of supplements I took in past year original symptoms were not resolved but new scary symptom were added

&amp;#x200B;

* Apathy ( this makes my experience crazier than ever as I just want to sleep all day compared to my previous self which was atleast active and addicted to screen 24/7).
* mind feels numb.
* Dulled sensory experience.

,schizophrenia,"I will start off by saying I'm pretty lucky as I am high-functioning (I got my Masters recently and, as long as I take my medications, I can maintain fairly normal relationships), but it feels like because of that, my friends and family tend to forget that I have a (at times) fairly debilitating condition. 

My paranoia isn't as bad as before I was medicated, but sometimes I just cannot go outside my house, and when I try to explain the reason why, people think I am being lazy or something, so I had to start making up excuses that sound more ""legitimate."" I actually failed a class because of this which delayed my graduation by a semester. People making fun of me for not leaving my house, even if it's a joke, still hurts. 

I DESPISE having my picture taken, being on camera, or being recorded and people immediately assume it's because I don't like how I look or sound or something and try telling me stuff about that even when I explain it has nothing to do with that.

I find it nearly impossible to confide in people because I always have a nagging feeling that they will stab me in the back any second, which makes people think I am distant or cold. My parents always tell me that I should be more open with them and I just don't have the heart to tell them that I do not trust them (or anyone else really).

People don't understand that in the rare moments of time when my mind is clear I need to utilize it and focus on my work/projects for like 18 hours without being interrupted and it makes me upset when I can't do that. Also, just because I have a video/music on my second monitor doesn't mean I'm not being productive, I just need the constant audio to suppress my auditory hallucinations. 

I played on a college esports team and the amount of times I heard things like ""schizo moment"", ""schizo calls"", ""went schizo for a moment"" was unbelievable, especially considering several of them knew I was schizophrenic (I try to be fairly open about it to try and destigmatize as much as I can). 

Had a friend that went through a manic episode and it was honestly disheartening the way my other friends wanted to deal with it (basically just cut him off) before I stepped in to tell them to be a bit more understanding and get him help since he's clearly going through an episode. It only reinforced my fear that if I go through a particularly severe paranoid episode, there might be no one there for me. 

This is not to mention the negative symptoms. Like I'm sorry that I don't have an emotional reaction to anything (other than annoyance sometimes), that my voice is monotone, that it's hard for me to take care of myself or even care about it. I'm trying my best, but sometimes it's not enough. Honestly, started crying as I wrote this and it's the most emotion I've felt in years.

Also, just because I have a video/music on my second monitor doesn&amp;#39;t mean I&amp;#39;m not being productive, I just need the constant audio to suppress my auditory hallucinations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played on a college esports team and the amount of times I heard things like &amp;quot;schizo moment&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;schizo calls&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;went schizo for a moment&amp;quot; was unbelievable, especially considering several of them knew I was schizophrenic (I try to be fairly open about it to try and destigmatize as much as I can). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a friend that went through a manic episode and it was honestly disheartening the way my other friends wanted to deal with it (basically just cut him off) before I stepped in to tell them to be a bit more understanding and get him help since he&amp;#39;s clearly going through an episode. It only reinforced my fear that if I go through a particularly severe paranoid episode, there might be no one there for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to mention the negative symptoms. Like I&amp;#39;m sorry that I don&amp;#39;t have an emotional reaction to anything (other than annoyance sometimes), that my voice is monotone, that it&amp;#39;s hard for me to take care of myself or even care about it. I&amp;#39;m trying my best, but sometimes it&amp;#39;s not enough. Honestly, started crying as I wrote this and it&amp;#39;s the most emotion I&amp;#39;ve felt in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idk, I get that I&amp;#39;m lucky that I can mostly seem to live a normal life, but I just can&amp;#39;t help and wish that I could actually live a normal life.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Does anyone else here find the mornings the most difficult part of the day? 

I used to love mornings but lately they're quite challenging. 

I think it might be because my night-time Risperidone has worn off and my morning dose needs a bit of time to kick in, but I always find the first few hours of the day the hardest. It mostly seems to be my energy levels that are affected, I just feel slow and dead in the mornings, but I also feel more anxious and sometimes a little paranoid depending on the day. 

It almost feels like each day I have a mountain to climb, I start off the mountain feeling crappy, then over the first couple of hours of the day I climb up to alright, then by hour 4-5 or so I'm feeling decent, and on good days by hour 7-9 I'll be feeling *good*. Once I'm there I usually stay there for the rest of the day until something happens to throw off my mood, which means every night I'm always dreading going to sleep, because in the night I'm feeling pretty good usually, but at the same time I know the good feeling I have will be gone again in the morning and I'll have to make the climb again.

It's one of the reasons I'm struggling to give up smoking again because in the past I started off weaning off the cigarettes by delaying my morning cigarette as long as possible - but recently my mornings have been rough and those first couple of cigarettes feel like the one thing getting me through it.

,schizophrenia,"hi all,

i’m a fictional author and always trying to include diverse representation in my books. my current work-in-progress is a romance told from the POV of the female main character who falls for the male main character who has schizophrenia. The book is not about the MMC’s schizophrenia, but it is a rather small subplot which i want to be as accurate as possible.

I’ve read through this subreddit a LOT and I have a few unanswered questions:

For those of you that are medicated/in therapy, what are your day to day “symptoms” (forgive me if this is poor terminology)?

Those of you in relationships, what are the best ways your partners have supported you? (Or ways that partners made things harder for you?)

&amp; any other advice I should know? (i.e. poor representations you’ve seen before/things I should avoid?) 

I appreciate this greatly. I can read all day in the DSM-5 or in research journals, but nothing is better than advice straight from the very people I’m attempting to represent.

&lt;p&gt;i’m a fictional author and always trying to include diverse representation in my books. my current work-in-progress is a romance told from the POV of the female main character who falls for the male main character who has schizophrenia. The book is not about the MMC’s schizophrenia, but it is a rather small subplot which i want to be as accurate as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve read through this subreddit a LOT and I have a few unanswered questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you that are medicated/in therapy, what are your day to day “symptoms” (forgive me if this is poor terminology)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of you in relationships, what are the best ways your partners have supported you? (Or ways that partners made things harder for you?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp; any other advice I should know? (i.e. poor representations you’ve seen before/things I should avoid?) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate this greatly. I can read all day in the DSM-5 or in research journals, but nothing is better than advice straight from the very people I’m attempting to represent. &lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hello,

I don’t know if I have this post tagged right, I apologize if it’s not.  I have some questions and I could really use some advice from people who have experience.

My partner recently had a pretty severe psychotic episode with delusions and hallucinations that landed him in the hospital.  We previously thought he had bipolar disorder, but the doctors thought otherwise after what they observed.  He was communicating to aliens, god, getting messages from tv shows, among other things.  He claimed he was channeling aliens, angels, demons.  Yelling in loud voices and shaking around, laughing hysterically at random points.  Then he’d just stare and not respond, occasionally shaking his head or nodding, chuckling — he was communicating with them, he said.  He’d go through periods of really intense negative emotion, happiness, and no emotion — according to him.  At one point he said he was channeling my spirit that was a demon trying to turn into an angel.  Eventually it subsided to a point that was less outwardly visible, but says the aliens/angels are testing him and making him a better person.  They told him not to lie and are making him tell me things that he has been lying to me about for like over 10 years.  I don’t want to go into details, but I’m reeling because I remember the incidents he’s telling me and remember thinking he was lying to me at the time.  I feel sick and feel like I’m in shock.

My question is, I guess — is it possible for his delusions to cause him to become more honest, like compulsively almost, because he says they’re making him a better person and making him tell the truth?  I’m so confused right now.  And the mood swings and staring off into the distance and not responding are scaring me.

He has an appointment with his psychiatrist soon.  He still doesn’t know what’s going on and I don’t think he can really consider that he could be sick.  I’m not sure how to help him right now.  I have a mental illness myself and I feel like I’m losing my sanity.

I’m not judging him, I realize this is rough.  I feel so bad for him.  :(

,schizophrenia,"Hi guys,  


I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia 6/7 years ago, I had awful delusions and hallucations, I didn't know what was real and what wasn't, my whole personality changed to try and face the new 'reality' that I was living in. However, with a combination of CBT, Ariprazole, Risperidone and Quetiapine (Not al at once, jesus) I managed to crawl my way out of the delusions, and the hallucinations without the delusions are an irritant at worst.  


But I'm still struggling with the negative symptoms 4/5 years later, I thought the emotional issues were potentially a defence mechanism that my brain would eventually repair, but they're still occuring.   


Let me describe what I'm experiencing now:

  
\- Incredibly low ""social battery"", after 30-60 minutes of conversation, my social battery feels completely empty, I can't think of things to say, I can't join in on any jokes, I pretty much go completely non-verbal for 30 minutes until I recharge, in a group this is fine, but 1 on 1 it makes for pretty awkward situations  


\- Emotional blunting/severe apathy, unless I'm intoxicated, I don't feel any emotion towards what people say or do, I don't get defensive, I don't get upset, I don't get offended, I don't find things funny, I don't express gratitude or love properly, I don't express concern etc. Outwardly I can still express these emotions in pantomine, but some people see straight through me and I can come across as fake or ingenuine. Before the schizophrenia I was a very emotionally intelligent and outwardly displaying person, but now I feel like a borderline psychopath emotionally.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sleep issues, I have never been able to sleep correctly, and can only sleep when I'm on brink of passing out from exhaustion. I've managed to get a 12-8 shift at my 9-5 to allow me to fall asleep at 4/5am without major consequence, but I would like to get some insight on this, and see if it's a result of the negative symptoms or just a personal thing, as I've had trouble with sleep ever since I was a child  


I would be interested to know if anybody has faced these same negative symptoms, and potential solutions to properly mitigate them. The fact that I tend to be okay emotionally when I'm intoxicated makes me think there's some sort of psychological block there, but on the other hand, the increased confidence could just improve my self deception. Either way, this tends to make me use alcohol and substances as a crutch when socialising, which I could do without.

,schizophrenia,"Hello,

My wife has noticed I have good and bad cycles. Ups and Downs. During the downs I’m very withdrawn, inward, and suspicious. During the ups I’m just pretty normal. 

She’s noticed some signs about to have a down. I thought this was interesting and just wanted to share.

1) I’ll get very opinionated and argumentative 

2) I stop really focusing on the current and new and focus more on like existing I guess? Idk she said I get really philosophical and interested in the way the universe is swirling around me and like brushing my teeth. 

3) I either stop eating as much or eat way more. During an up I’ll eat pretty healthy and a lot of different things. When I’m down I eat more hearty comfort meals and nostalgic things that remind me of my childhood.

4) I will do things that bring me a lot of comfort. I’ll start the harry potter series over or lord of the rings. When I’m good I’ll seek out new books.

5) I’ll get really religious when I’m starting to decline too.

Does this apply to any of yall to? What does your rock look for to monitor your mental health?

&lt;p&gt;1) I’ll get very opinionated and argumentative &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) I stop really focusing on the current and new and focus more on like existing I guess? Idk she said I get really philosophical and interested in the way the universe is swirling around me and like brushing my teeth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) I either stop eating as much or eat way more. During an up I’ll eat pretty healthy and a lot of different things. When I’m down I eat more hearty comfort meals and nostalgic things that remind me of my childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) I will do things that bring me a lot of comfort. I’ll start the harry potter series over or lord of the rings. When I’m good I’ll seek out new books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) I’ll get really religious when I’m starting to decline too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this apply to any of yall to? What does your rock look for to monitor your mental health?&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"So basically as the title says. I feel like for myself, during depressive episodes or even regular moods with no mania, it just feels like I don’t want to be bothered by anyone and don’t reach out to friends or acquaintances at all. I wouldn’t say I hate doing it, because I actually will respond quite quickly when others try to initiate the conversation or activity. But I just don’t feel confident enough to engage in any meaningful social interaction. I feel like this is really a hinderance to my personal development. Furthermore, I’m not even sure if it’s related to bipolar, just curious if anyone else had any experience with this.

I feel like for myself, during depressive episodes or even regular moods with no mania, it just feels like I don’t want to be bothered by anyone and don’t reach out to friends or acquaintances at all. I wouldn’t say I hate doing it, because I actually will respond quite quickly when others try to initiate the conversation or activity. But I just don’t feel confident enough to engage in any meaningful social interaction. I feel like this is really a hinderance to my personal development. Furthermore, I’m not even sure if it’s related to bipolar, just curious if anyone else had any experience with this.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi, what advice do you wish you knew early on in your treatment/diagnosis of BD? I'm open to hearing anything. But given my circumstances, I'm especially interested in mitigating the pain that BD often inflicts on SO's, friends, family, etc. Any constructive advice/criticism is welcome.

### Backstory  
I'm a 30'sM with diagnosed&amp;medicated BD2. I'm only 3 months into diagnosis, still finding meds (Lithium+Depakote) that work for me, maintaining a high level of work/life/social/therapy/personal wellbeing, and am in the process of attempting reconcilliation with my (living apart) ex-fiance. I'm far from great, but considering the number of rock bottoms in my life, I'm doing well.

My symptoms started strongly expressing after both of my parents died days apart in 2020 (not COVID related). Up until then, I could communicate and perceive reality clearly. I'm a recovering addict who had a decade under his belt before rocketing towardsvtgis new flavor of hypomanic/mixed episode. While I was still my loving and goofy self, I started gaslighting my ex when she would understandably express concern. That turned into further detachment from trusting others, and both manipulating and controlling people and situations. I then took on my parents' estates w/o lawyers (didn't need to), and was fueled by a great deal of shame and trauma. This ""valid"" obsession allowed me to get away with a lot while grieving, and few others could see how different I had become. I was high functioining until I wasn't.

Around the time of closing each estate's probate case, I placed my hypomanic energy into a fear of abandonment that drove me to curate relationships, both platonic and one romantic for a childhood friend, to help me navigate my new unhinged version of reality. While I expressed love in countless healthy ways, I was also absent for my ex in ways that truly mattered as she navigated her own grief and traumas. I started fantasizing about ""ideal"" realities to help me cope with feeling unsafe in my own body.

Finally, after an array of triggers stacked a year ago - flu, rsv, covid, long covid, being alone, grief, and normal holiday anxiety - I allowed my other reality all the footing and outwardly expressed ""love"" to someone else on the phone. I thought that once she didn't reciprocate, then we could go back to friendship. She had become like a ""mom surrogate"" and we had been trauma bonded since childhood. To my surprise in that reality, no, friendship was not safe for her, and we stopped talking.

Months later, I told my ex the partial truth about the other woman, and denied the rest. Instead of saying I thought I loved her, I told her the closest truth I actually believed: I only had ""feelings"" for my friend. I didn't say the ""love"" had faded along with a hypomanic state. I didn't understand what BD, hypomania, mixed episode, or any of what I was experiencing actually was. Had I known then maybe something could have gone differently. All I knew for certain in my reality was: **they will all leave me if they know I don't understand myself anymore.**

After the facts of the emotional affair came out, my ex left me within the week. I became suicidal, obsessive, confused about my old therapist saying I definitely don't have bipolar, left that therapist, did a codepency retreat, joined 12 Step SLAA for love addiction, found a psychiatrist, got diagnosed ADHD, left psychiatrist as he was a dick, and **finally** found a psychiatrist + therapist that I can trust all of myself with, and was formally diagnosed and treated for BD2 😌  I would not be alive without my care team.

Now, my ex and I are in the process of a full disclosure to give her everything she needs to heal from the emotional affair, and hopefully process some of the pain of almost marrying someone who wasn't aware of their own BD (i.e. provide her moments in the relationship where BD took the wheel and gaslit, manipulated, or was cruel to her). There's no promise to reconcile, but it's the necessary first step.

It's been a very, very intense week as the holidays are primed to find all the cracks in my BD treatment plan, and introduce brand new triggers. lol thanks Santa 🎁. Even with a decade of therapy and success with some meds, I still find myself disappointing and hurting her even with the best of intentions + planning (e.g. communication blunders on both ends, oversharing, expecting too much too soon, etc.). I have a CSAT therapist for the emotional affair work, and one for BD2/ADHD. Meds and therapy are life saving and I'm improving. My shame is shifting towards more acceptance more often than not (well, except during trigger week... er, I mean ""the holidays"" 🫠).

But, I'm soberly aware that if I keep up at even this rate of healing, there will be no option for reconciliation. Even though it breaks my heart to imagine a lifetime without her, I can't blame her if the day-to-day of a BD2 SO would not be worth it for her (especially after my betrayal). Or, she just doesn't have that level of commitment to provide me/us given her own trauma history that she'll be unpacking for years to come. It's been promising to hear her talk about reading so much on bipolar, and asking questions and trying to make plans about what the relationship would look like given both of our needs. I pray there's hope for us but I see clearly how much I am asking of her to not only trust me again, but to trust that a relationship with a BD2 partner (even) in treatment could be safe and lead to a fulfilling life for her+me.

I have to make sure I don't unnecessarily hurt her or myself further because of manageable elements of BD2.

,bipolar,"It's Christmas Eve and everything's falling apart. My boss sent me an email at 4:30 on Thursday, telling me she was rescinding my working from home and I would be in-office full-time starting next week, due to ""the amount of correction emails you are receiving is significantly higher than where they should be, at this point and often on a consistent basis for the same mistakes. I have given you many tools and resources through our monthly one on one sessions and it appears that your conceptual understanding of the job is lacking.""

I'm increasingly struggling to focus and pay attention, misplacing things, getting confused about what I was doing and I'm supposed to do. Maybe I have ADHD also, I don't know. I even blanked on my last appointment with my therapist, didn't even realize it until 2 or 3 hours after it was scheduled.

My idk what... best friend, partner, person, situationship...? for the past several months just told me off and told me to stop talking to her. She previously said she found it so confusing to talk to me because my language is too imprecise that she went and sat in her car and cried in frustration, and I asked her if she even liked me or liked spending time with me, and she said she wasn't sure.

I'm currently stable, and well, not anxious depressed or manic. Also happy with my meds. Plus im feeling creative.

I've been manic more than six times. (lost track). I've been depressed for over a waking year of my life. Bedridden for most of it! I've struggled with suicidality for a year of my waking life. 

I just took Vancouver coastal health's peer support course and I got 97%! I start my practicum here in town shortly

I have been incredibly fortunate with what has been given to me. But I have also been smart and strong with my decision making and where I've been spending my time

Things that have helped me: 
Self advocacy with my psychiatrist
Spending time speaking with social workers
Quitting nicotine and alcohol
A rigid sleep schedule
Weightlifting
Meditating for at least 15 minutes per day
Calling support lines often
Keeping my space clean
Eating healthy (high protein, low sugar, fruit and veggies)
Socializing often (support lines help with that)
Taking my meds --1200mg lithium, 200mg lamotrigine, 10mg prozac, 15mg loxipine, 7.5mg zoplicone--
Walking daily
Diligent personal hygiene

Woke up Friday, not sleepy at all. Got to work and was so so fast I had time to take longer breaks, brain racing on the plan lists at the same time. The main thing was to get a chicken for dinner so where to go how long get there price hate parking what else get where. Got home, ran the vac, started the dishwasher, changed my sheets, swept the floor, wiped table, did the prep for dinner and put in oven. Within about 2 hours.

Every time I get stressed out or tired or busy or emotional or horny or feel anything basically, I get sad because it’s number now. I used to feel things so deeply! I wrote loads of weird stuff about it! I felt a deep kinship with Byron and Shelley and Coleridge and all the other genius writers “touched with fire”.. 

But now sure I write. 100k people have read what I write (this is not a delusion of grandeur! This is true!). But it’s not really the same. Used to be able to write as easily and automatically as breathing and now I have to think about it. I don’t like thinking about it. Even at school I never bothered planning anything with my essays, I just wrote, and I got full marks. I see people saying that meds stifling creativity is a myth, but I’m not so sure. I’m on lamotrigine and I’ve seen a Lot of chat here about word recall. I also can’t think of rhymes as easily! Half my sentences used to rhyme! I’d make amazing connections in seconds without thinking.. almost like automatic writing. 

And then there’s the other side effects. Weight gain (I was told it’d not have been an issue if I had more willpower), bad dreams (nightmares every night! I wake up crying in fear!). It is so boring wasting so much time sleeping. I used to have most of every night stretching out in front of me, so much time. So much power, being awake when other people are asleep. Getting about 5 hours of sleep at the moment so nowhere near dangerland. 

My meds don’t really stop me having episodes, either. Feels fairly pointless. Chemists always fucks it up and I have to waste half my life hunting down a basic fucking medication. And there is so much else to do!

When I sprint down the lane after a 10k run. When I know what someone will say before they say it, when I do well in my Russian practice, when I learn a fascinating new fact of Old English.. sometimes at gigs too. But not as often.

So there’s a lot of positive things happening in my life right now

I just finished a whole semester of college for the first time in 2 years which feels amazing. My relationships have been going well and I feel pretty great generally with the holidays coming.

However I have started to notice some pretty major red flags concerning my mood. I have had trouble falling asleep, have been more talkative, more fixated/stimulated about stuff, etc. 

One of the things I did a lot when I was with mania and therefore is a warning sign is that I would change the things around me a lot (the arrangement of my furniture/decorations, the lighting, etc). In the last few days I have being trying to resist the urge to do these kind of things. 

So I’m pretty worried about going back into mania. After my last episode I took it upon myself to learn about this illness and so im pretty informed. Ill definitely be taking my meds religiously as well as and maintining a good sleep hygiene and all the basic stuff.

However I’m wondering if any of you have any experience seeing an episode coming and trying to prevent it. 

Thank you very much for your advice &amp; happy holidays!",t2_dhdvhr8y,False,,0,False,How do you prevent mania when you see it coming?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18pqw0t,False,light,1.0,,public,8,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Support/Advice :shy:,False,8,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1703405524.0,richtext,,,,text,self.bipolar,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello fellow bipolar spawns.&lt;/p&gt;

I started having a hard time with my emotions in high school and it worked once I was in college and then it got bad after I graduated. I’m currently 22 and was finally diagnosed with bipolar II about 2 months ago. I was prescribed lamotragine to stabilize my mood. I’m not sure if the meds are causing my mood swings but more recently I’ve been really angry and irritated. Earlier today was like the final nail in the coffin. I was going to the mall with my boyfriend so I could get a stuffed animal dolphin that I thought was cute and we were about to park in a spot as we were backing up into it a woman came out of nowhere and  stood in the middle of the spot. I jumped out of the car and asked her to move and she refused cause she wanted her friend to park the car there even tho me and my bf were halfway in the spot. So I asked her again and she started threatening me so I called her an ugly ass bitch and my bf drove off. I just got so angry in that moment that i made him spin around ask I could dump a bunch of leftover rice from Benihana onto the car. This is so unlike me I have never done this in my life and idk why I did it but after all was said and done I had a huge panic attack and it took me 20 minutes to calm down. I tried asking for advice in another subreddit but everyone kept blaming me and telling me I committed a crime. I know it’s not right I just don’t know what got into me in that moment.

I cycled so rapidly and eventually got into a deep psychotic episode. I’m finally on meds for about two years now and six months sober of everything.

Problem is I destroyed my memory of things I did! But apparently not permanently because things are starting to come back and I’m drowning in the shame and guilt that’s coming up.

I degraded myself so many times. For instance: I did porn for one of those live streaming websites (before OF was a thing) and bragged about it at my high school reunion. Had a threesome with my partner and kept contact with the third even though my partner said I had to stop and if I kept going it would be cheating. I stayed even though they were humiliating me and abusing me and I didnt want it. I signed up on sugar daddy websites and tried to be a sugar baby. That meant so many gross phone calls saying disgusting things and so many times I did this in front of my partner. Humiliated myself and my partner in front of their friends by asking about their sex lives the first time I met them and constantly keeping the conversation about sex. And so much more that keeps flooding into my mind. And I wasn’t even horny during any of it. All I remember is that I wanted attention, something to make me feel better and to know that I was wanted. 

My poor partner was there for me through everything even though I treated them like dirt. They’ve finally snapped and lost their love for me and probably is leaving me. I wish I could’ve taken my meds sooner and gotten sober sooner. I finally tried naltrexone and it’s the only thing keeping me from drinking. It’s like a miracle - I have zero cravings. They went away almost the same day I started that med.

I’m trying to forgive myself or at least be more understanding. I was traumatized with medications being forced into my mouth constantly (stuff I never needed) when I was a kid, so I couldn’t get over that in time before I imploded. I grew up with alcoholics that kept making me drink ever since I was a kid, too. I’m trying to tell myself that of course it’s ok I struggled before I got to this point.

But I can’t!! I can’t stand it!! I’m such a horrible person for what I did to my love, my person, my partner!! The list goes on and on and on and I can’t believe they stayed this long. I don’t blame them for needing to leave me, but I’m absolutely devastated.

,bipolar,"First, i'd like to wish you all a merry christmas and hope that you have a good time.

Five months ago, i [made this posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/14xw2y9/when_you_are_confronted_with_serious_problems_but/) here in this sub, i'd like to give you an update and i think, Christmas is a very good time to share this.

For those who don't have time to see the link, it was about the problems i faced, my parents were injured in a car crash, my dog was injured, my brother has cancer and i struggled with bipolar.

I'll tell you how it turned out: My parents survived, they still got some problems, but the doc expect a full recovery. They made it, got through with emergency surgery and then the entire process of rehab. It looks better for my brother about cancer, his body responds well to the treatment. There are more, rather small details, like i was able to avoid a relapse with drugs. My dog is also healthy again.

Today, we'll have a christmas dinner together at my family home and no seat will be empty, no one was lost. It was a hard time for all of us. It was at some points critical about life and death.

I'd like to thank the community here in the sub and also i was happy that some of you reached out to me with writing me DM's when i was in that long and dark night. It was the support i needed to keep going on.

Don't lose hope when you get confronted with such serious problems, where you don't know what is coming. Don't give up, even when the odds are stacked against you. In the end, you can still win and live to see better times.

Thanks for your support again, i'm really looking forward to our dinner and that we are all still alive, it's like a happy ending, even when it is just temporary. The good times are where you need to recover and gain new strength, so i will cherish every minute of this. 

P.S.  
They'll never get to read this i guess, but there were good people in the aftermath of the car crash, other cars stopped and civilians gave first aid to my parents, called the emergency services.

,bipolar,"’m emotionally and spiritually exhausted. I started the year with high expectations for personal growth and positive changes physically, personally, professionally, &amp; socially. Fast forward to March through May, with da sun and out of hospital once a month. He coded on Easter &amp; was fortunately able to recover without neurological deficits. 

The summer at least for 2 months gave us some respite but first week of August had to send daughter to urgent care for vomiting. Again, fortunately, a one time thing.

Move ahead to October and dad is sick with pneumonia in hospital! That same weekend my mom and I get COVID. After 10 days, I notice my daughter has a lingering cough. Within a month and a half, we are treating once with one antibiotic for 10 days which seems to resolve until she starts coughing again with fevers! Luckily, negative results for all viral tests. But the cough stays and then we get call from her pediatrician and we start on augmentin. Cough is gone!

In the clear? Not yet because once she’s done she develops hives of unknown origin. It doesn’t help that the doctor says it could have been a whole number of things. So now she’s on Benadryl for at most 5 days and see if there’s improvement. 

Plus, we live by a creek that on occasion has reached threatening flood levels. In fact, we are dealing with PTSD from basement flooding 2020 and 2021, the last one life threatening for my husband. His anxiety is so bad when it comes to storms, I feel I absorb it too.

Having written so much, I fear I’m currently in an anxiety induced mania that set me to hospital back in 2021.

It doesn’t help I’m fighting with therapy office about payments that insurance says I didn’t have to pay for PLUS my therapist I’ve had good rapport with is out due to a car accident!

I’m feeling quite overwhelmed that I noticed it is now affecting me at work. I do have people I feel safe with that calm me but it is t always the same people every day.

This is probably more a vent than helpful. Sorry. And anyone who’s read up to the end….thank you. I just need to know someone is out there?

So, I was already in a bad place and, recently, my mom's be diagnosed with breast cancer and I'm the one who's taking care of everything (going to doctor, dealing with her medical insurance).

We have been together for a long time and I love him a lot, so that's why I've never considered (and ""needed"" having sex with other guys until now. It feels like i'm gonna go crazy if I don't do that now, because life has been drowing me and I just need to release some pressure, but I know this is wrong and that he doesn't deserve that - which is the main reason why I haven't done anything physical.

19M 

I'm a transplant recipient and in april 2023 i went into hospital for organ rejection, the treatment for this is multiple steroids at a very very high dose example being 500mg of prednisone, the end result of this and at the time having no medication for bipolar i went into psychosis, i was in hospital from april to i think june or july? i remember none of this and only remember beginning of April and August (a bit of July)

July is when i finally got home from hospital and my Cat died.. so i was dealing with that aswell 


In between this i said some really shit things to my Mom, my little sister, my older brother and my friends.. all of which i don't remember and i only have texts of what i said (i have absolutely no idea of what else beyond this) 

The aftermath of my behavior? well... I'm not allowed to live with my Mom and Little sister, they aren't supporting me in anyway anymore and have told me we can't go back to the way things were because of what i did.. the information i was given of my behavior was this: I'm manipulative, i don't act like family, i guilt trip, i said i don't see my Mom as my mom or friend, i implied my mom doesn't do enough for me, i implied she's not good enough.

What sucks is i do not remember ANYTHING which is scary... i pride myself on being the best person i can be.. i have so much love to give i appreciate everything the people in my life have done for me i try to be understanding and listen to people and i take criticism well.. so it confuses me how i can act so differently and i don't even remember...

since all this happened I've done multiple things to make sure I'm a good person who is still worthy of my mothers love... I've been going to the gym, i stopped drinking completely, I've been going to therapy which is completely draining my wallet without coverage but whatever, I'm working more towards my goals.. I've been controlling myself so much better since being bipolar meds.

because of this i decided to have a conversation with my mother again... it was going well until i completely broke down and started crying and essentially begged for them to take me back... i attempted to explain the psychosis and i expressed how i was scared and the end result of me doing this was her saying i was guilt tripping her... even though to me atleast all i was doing was expressing how I've been feeling.. i didn't blame her for anything i never even brought her into it.. all i did was say the things i was feeling since she said i couldn't live with them anymore it's not like my intention was to manipulate or guilt trip i just needed my mom...

i expressed that i thought if i started improving myself everything would go back to normal and i was told that's not how family works and things will never go back to how they once were...

My living situation atm is a risk to my physical health, I'm likely going to need another transplant in a few years or sooner but i can't get one because i lack support now, I have an older brother but he lives in the states (I'm in Canada) so living with him isn't an option.. i am lost and scared and I'm trying my absolute hardest...

&lt;p&gt;because of this i decided to have a conversation with my mother again... it was going well until i completely broke down and started crying and essentially begged for them to take me back... i attempted to explain the psychosis and i expressed how i was scared and the end result of me doing this was her saying i was guilt tripping her... even though to me atleast all i was doing was expressing how I&amp;#39;ve been feeling.. i didn&amp;#39;t blame her for anything i never even brought her into it.. all i did was say the things i was feeling since she said i couldn&amp;#39;t live with them anymore it&amp;#39;s not like my intention was to manipulate or guilt trip i just needed my mom...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i expressed that i thought if i started improving myself everything would go back to normal and i was told that&amp;#39;s not how family works and things will never go back to how they once were...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My living situation atm is a risk to my physical health, I&amp;#39;m likely going to need another transplant in a few years or sooner but i can&amp;#39;t get one because i lack support now, I have an older brother but he lives in the states (I&amp;#39;m in Canada) so living with him isn&amp;#39;t an option.. i am lost and scared and I&amp;#39;m trying my absolute hardest... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother still talks to me despite everything.. so why can&amp;#39;t my mother?&lt;/p&gt;

I put my trust in a select few to help me manage my condition.  A few days ago I was quite happy and anxiety seemed like a distant stranger.  I was putting on a show for my baby girl, singing &amp; dancing in the morning.  Then my husband looked at me strangely.  “Do… do I need to take today off of work?”  I was surprised.  Why would he ask me that?  He pointed out that I was unusually excited, talking fast, etc.  But I was just in a good mood, right? He asked me to check in with my therapist; perhaps he was mistaken.  

Later that day, my therapist confirmed that I was talking faster than usual.  “How’ve you been sleeping?” She asked.  Uh oh..  not very much sleep.  But that’s normal with a baby, right?  Except baby had been sleeping through the night &amp; I… had not.  

So I agreed to take the steps to address the hypo-mania.  I took my emergency, fast-acting anti-psychotic; cancelled a play date I had planned &amp; went to bed early that night.   I got 12 hrs of sleep.  Groggy, I emerged the next day after a hard reset.  Sure I don’t feel quite as sing-songy or ready to run a marathon.  But I feel good.  I listened to the people I trust and I took care of myself.  

 Even if the highs feel really good.  Even if they don’t exactly feel like highs, I know where they can lead.  I have responsibilities, a child to care for.  I’m thankful for my husband &amp; my therapist.  And I’m proud of myself. 

TL/ DR: I trusted my husband &amp; therapist when they identified I might be hypomanic &amp; took corrective action to manage my Bipolar.

I have been diagnosed for roughly a year, but I have had this disorder for about 2.5-3 years. During this time I have never told my family, they know nothing about my well-being and I have liked to keep it separate. I live in another city and only see them once or twice a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the issue is that my conversation therapist has been pushing me lately to tell them. He believes that this would drop a stone off my shoulders. While he is likely correct, I can only see bad things coming out of this. My family very rarely talk about our issues and pains. Cronical illnesses are mentioned in passing by and serious pain is kept under the rug. This isn't healthy or good but it is how we do things. However, I also know that by telling my mother, the rest of my family and relatives would know within a week. I wouldn't want this. I also know that I would never get a moment of peace after telling her, everything would become about my well-being and she would never see me anymore only the disorder. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the real question is:

Is there anyone like me who didn't want to tell anyone but eventually did? What were the outcomes, do you regret it, etc. etc. 

I would appreciate all answers and experiences that might help me make a decision.

,bipolar,"hey everyone this is my second ever reddit post so bear with me please. 

21F, i was diagnosed around 1.5/2 years ago after i had my first manic episode. i have also been diagnosed with GAD, a dissociative disorder, and PTSD. i am unmedicated for all of these willingly as i was on abilify, but could not take it consistently and my parents worried about the physical effects of going off and on meds (family history of blood clots, stroke, etc.). i started using daylio to track my moods and have worked on a lot of grounding/coping mechanisms to somewhat alleviate my various symptoms.

i’ve been staying with my family who i haven’t seen in a few years (i grew up with them but moved across the US when i was 15) and while it has been lovely, they are in poor health. my time here has been very sweet and i’ve been feeling good, but i can tell when i leave in a few days i’m probably going to have a depressive episode. 

i’ve dealt with my depression fairly well through my life, and i can identify it easily before i’m truly in the throes of it. the last true depressive episode i had was entirely different because i had what i can only describe as symptoms of psychosis (hallucinations, ideation, paranoia). does anyone have any tips on how to manage those symptoms if they come up? last time this happened i was on “watch” for two weeks and couldn’t work, which i can’t do this time due to my financial situation. 

i am also wondering if anyone has any tricks to identifying manic episodes. i’ve had a few but until i was diagnosed after my first, i hadn’t experienced that before. i tend to not understand my mania until i’m at the tail end of an episode, usually after i’ve done something reckless/“bad” (spending money, getting new jobs, driving for extreme amounts of time/traveling, etc.) i’m worried this time because if i am about to have a depressive episode, my family has expressed to me that i could move with them back to my home town. im worried that i will take them up on this offer and not completely think it through (leaving my current primary support system for a cross country move) 

i think the fact that im thinking about this now is a good sign, but i tend to dissociate during my manic episodes so im not sure if ill even remember the pros and cons of moving back to be with my family. 

any tips are appreciated, sorry for word vomiting &lt;3",t2_d8ur0xj8,False,,0,False,Struggling identifying episodes/ managing functioning,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,False,,,0,,,False,t3_18r2mqg,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Support/Advice :shy:,False,2,,False,False,nsfw,False,,[],{},,True,,1703575337.0,richtext,,,,text,self.bipolar,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hey everyone this is my second ever reddit post so bear with me please. &lt;/p&gt;

If you don’t give a shit i completely understand, have a peaceful day. 

So, i’ve always fought to get a diagnosis because i thought that it would validate my experience and people would finally stop treating me like i’m exaggerating. Ive been to the psych clinic 2 times this year and i’ve been on meds and all that. But i hadn’t seen it on paper you know. And recently i finally did. Turns out i was diagnosed with bipolar? They just didn’t tell me. And now i feel empty and sad. I don’t want that diagnosis anymore because i feel like i can’t go back you know? It would be for life if i wasn’t diagnosed too but this feels more official. Everytime i see something about bipolar being for life, tears well in my eyes. Like yea congrats you’re stuck with this because we said so, the only thing you can do about it is take those meds that you hate and pay for expensive therapy sessions. 

I feel like an ingrate. I wanted someone to tell me that i wasn’t delusional but now that it has happened, i want the opposite. Please go back on your words and tell me it was just a phase and i won’t have to seriously consider ending it all anymore. I think i was in deep denial, in more than one way. I wanted to reassure myself that i wasn’t « worthless to society » and just a product of my trauma. But thinking about it now, i don’t actually give a shit about pleasing anyone in this depressing world. Am i fraud?
I’m conflicted because on one hand i don’t wanna be a burden to the people i genuinely care about, but on the other hand i don’t wanna be a « useful member of society » because i despise this disgusting society i live in. Besides the people i love i can’t think of a single reason i would want to hang on. I find fault in everything. I’m cynical and negative (i’m probably only saying this bc i’m depressed rn but whatever). I just can’t help myself, i don’t wanna keep the peace and no matter how hard i try to convince myself otherwise, i almost never want to put in effort. 
I know i’m not a terrible person, i have values, i try to help people as best as i can and i would never hurt anyone intentionally. So why do i feel so stupid and mean and unreasonable ??? :(

I just have this gut wrenching feeling every time somebody talks to me, I’m just waiting for them to bring up last Christmas. I’m trying to enjoy it and I have been, it’s just hard. All the memories are just coming back up to the surface. I just want it to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"I have Type 2 BP, ever since I moved into my boyfriend's family's home my depressive lows have been increasing and I've been sleeping for days and can't find a way out of it easily. There are a few days I manage to live out a whole day normally.

I was diagnosed professionally when I was a child at 7 and had therapy until I was 16.
I'm 25 now and since 17, I never medicate for it anymore and I take daily vitamins and have a focused diet to keep me more stable. 

My boyfriend's family is very laid back and understanding so there is no issue at all with them which I am thankful for. 

My boyfriend and I spend every second together and he seems to never handle my bipolar lows well at all. I'm very calm during my low episodes, just extremely fatigue, overwhelmingly sad, and distant. When I sleep for long hours, my boyfriend takes it personally and feels very victimized. He tends to ask questions almost everyday now. He asks ""Do you love me?"" ""Are you happy with me?"" ""You don't want to do anything with me?""
This is almost heartbreaking and I've repeatedly told him that I'm having episodes and I do my best to ground myself daily but they are very prevalent having bipolar. It feels like there's a part of his brain that will never comprehend the struggle of bipolar being entirely internal and has nothing to do with him. I do believe it is making my episodes worse now that his victimized outbreaks are a daily reaction. He thinks I'm angry at him all the time or ignoring him on purpose or I don't want anything to do with him. I never argue, I just shut down emotionally and get paralyzed to function to talk or even look in the eyes, giving a distant atmosphere often. It turns into me having to comfort him in the amidst of melancholy daily and this energy having to remind him constantly that I love him and it has nothing to do with him is exhausting.

There are a few days I manage to live out a whole day normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed professionally when I was a child at 7 and had therapy until I was 16.
I&amp;#39;m 25 now and since 17, I never medicate for it anymore and I take daily vitamins and have a focused diet to keep me more stable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend&amp;#39;s family is very laid back and understanding so there is no issue at all with them which I am thankful for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend and I spend every second together and he seems to never handle my bipolar lows well at all. I&amp;#39;m very calm during my low episodes, just extremely fatigue, overwhelmingly sad, and distant. When I sleep for long hours, my boyfriend takes it personally and feels very victimized. He tends to ask questions almost everyday now. He asks &amp;quot;Do you love me?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Are you happy with me?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t want to do anything with me?&amp;quot;
This is almost heartbreaking and I&amp;#39;ve repeatedly told him that I&amp;#39;m having episodes and I do my best to ground myself daily but they are very prevalent having bipolar. It feels like there&amp;#39;s a part of his brain that will never comprehend the struggle of bipolar being entirely internal and has nothing to do with him. I do believe it is making my episodes worse now that his victimized outbreaks are a daily reaction. He thinks I&amp;#39;m angry at him all the time or ignoring him on purpose or I don&amp;#39;t want anything to do with him. I never argue, I just shut down emotionally and get paralyzed to function to talk or even look in the eyes, giving a distant atmosphere often. It turns into me having to comfort him in the amidst of melancholy daily and this energy having to remind him constantly that I love him and it has nothing to do with him is exhausting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a great relationship with him and we are very caring to each other, but these episodes are affecting him a lot and making me worse with his reaction. &lt;/p&gt;

I still don’t know if i have had a slight hypo mania or i was falling in love… Also we both couldn’t understand if it’s love or strong impression. By the time he visited me again, it didn’t go well this time. We had such intense conversations and pointless fights. The last day we decided to save the relationship and he went. We couldn’t make it, wished the best for each other and cut the painter.
After a little while he texted me some very awkward messages and asked to call. In this calling I could sense something was wrong about his mindset, he was talking about creating a new language and that kind of big things. Since we have a long distance I couldn’t do anything but worry. I felt like I was affecting his mind and I felt guilty. We ended talking 2,5 months ago till last Friday, he send my favorite perfume that he ordered while we were talking. I couldn’t take the shipping bcs of the customs. I texted to report what happened before he recoup and say thank you&amp;take care. He didn’t answer three days. I texted again taht “Can you please just send a sign that I can understand if you and we are okay? It beats me and i think we don’t deserve this. Any sign that i can make sense the situation is fair enough”. He said “Hey. We are completly ok. I had a psychosis two months ago. And now I’m trying to get better. It’s a shame that the parfume cannot arrive. I knew it would be a problem but I tried with the lying method.  Didnt work 🤷‍♂️. I hope you’re  doing ok as well. 
Take care” I felt devastated and i still do. I partly blame myself for his psychosis… It was his first serious relationship and came too much for him. Our lives were so different and the affection was unbalanced, he was the one got affected mostly.
I am saying partly because he was using mari since he was 17. Even though I know this is the main and rational reason for psychosis, I also know deeply that I triggered and contributed. when I saw his message I couldn’t stay rational and said “I can’t describe how much i am sorry Josh… I feel terrible about my unintentional contribution for this. At our last call I could sense something but I couldn’t do anything, I’ve felt like whatever I do would be another harm for you. I won’t hurt you again ever, I hope nothing can hurt your beautiful heart. I hope you get better and, the best 🤍” He didn’t respond.
I really feel so bad and I regret what I wrote. I don’t know if he didn’t respond because he blames me, too or we already said goodbye for the last time… I feel like shit.

,bipolar,"I (27F w/ BP) was watching a Ted talk about understanding bipolar disorder where the speaker claimed that bipolar cannot be cured. In the comment section there were a few people claiming that they’ve seen it cured through first or second hand experiences.

from what I understand there is research that supports the the idea that bipolar might not be curable. I personally don’t believe it can be cured but it can definitely be treated to mitigate the problems it causes which leads to a functioning human being and that’s more than enough.. but is it? Is there a different way for this story to end?

 I’ve been struggling with it since I was a preteen and I’ve gotten to the point where instead of looking for light at the end of the tunnel, I am comforted and at home in its darkness. Is that a bad way to view my condition? Is it negative or realistic?

How did they cure themselves? Can it really be done?

,bipolar,"I’m writing this post as if to myself, but I figured it would be helpful (mainly for myself tbh) to share it with you folks.

I received my diagnosis a few months ago during the summer, and though my psychiatrist used a lot of words to describe me, the gist of it was that I have Bipolar I Disorder. His actual diagnostic impression was much more nuanced, but it all pointed to the same thing:

There’s something wrong with me; I’m unstable in the most explicit sense of the word.

That’s what it all pointed to, but I’ve come to learn I’m much more than bipolar. I had my first true mania a year ago, and it got so bad (I became psychotic) that I had to withdraw from school and take a semester off.

I came back and I had to withdraw again, this time because I was too depressed. I was in the throes of a cannabis addiction, and things weren’t looking good.

I feel like myself again, though, and I’ve finally got it. I can’t tell you the moment I felt it, but at some point the broken pieces of my life came together like a puzzle. Like kintsugi. I can feel things start to turn around for me, even if I don’t always know with certainty.

Ever since I ‘misplaced my mind’ last year, people look at me differently, and never in my life have I been so solitary. I’ve decided, then, that I need to learn to keep myself company. And I have. My diagnosis is very isolating, but I’ve finally made some peace with it. Mental illness or no, it’s me all the way down, and the people who I care about won’t judge me.

I can’t wait to see how much I improve next year.

,bipolar,"I had a bad relationship with my mom during a manic episode in august, she brought my brother into it which caused a whole break in my family.Fights, argumest and abuse were non stop.

After I had multiple alcohol indused amnesia and came down from my episode i admitted myself to the psychward in my country (after multiple attempts from my doctor and my mom but I gaslighted and manipulated them into thinking I'm fine.)

After I was admitted I asked my mom to text my brother who was were close to me during my childhood (not so much now) bc I needed his support and I wanted to apologize for all the things I did during my mania.

He never reached out, asked me how i was, and he even promised my mom to text me (which he never did).

Fast forward to today bc xmas was actually quite fun with my mom and I genuenly enjoyed being with her after every shit that happened this year.

We went to my brothers house and he SAUD NOTHING.
I said there without a word smiling at his kid getting a present and I bursted out crying.
It was so uncomfortable being there knowing they dont like me for what happened.
I stood up, put my shoes on and he came after me saying ""What the fuck is wrong?""
I explained in a few words how it hurt that he never once reached out to me during all of this and he said ""Well noone told me who brought you in to the hospital? And if it was even the psych ward, how else would i know if it was a surgery or smth else?""

I explained in a few words how it hurt that he never once reached out to me during all of this and he said &amp;quot;Well noone told me who brought you in to the hospital? And if it was even the psych ward, how else would i know if it was a surgery or smth else?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked him to let me out and he did saying nothing else, i&amp;#39;m currently sitting at the bus stop not far from their house crying and promising myself to never go over to them ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate this...&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"Background story

&amp;#x200B;

I had depression since I was 13 years old. Nevertheless, I studied hard to go to a good college. When I entered my college, the department office tried to open an interview with a decent TV channel. (At least to my professors, I was an exceptionally good case.) I showed the symptoms of depression, but I was unmedicated because I did not know anything about mental health issues. I just thought ""it is what it is"" and bottled up my issues. It was only third year of college that I went to doc. (this was 2017)

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since 2017, I started taking depression meds. Of course, they did not work out. Back then, I did not know I was bipolar. So I worked my ass off WITHOUT the help of mood stabilizers and what not.  Still, (thanks to caffeine and nicotine) I graduated college with a good GPA.

Everything seemed perfect. I started my MA degree at the fall of 2021. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now

However, things got fucked up. In 2021 winter, My first hypomanic episode occurred. I was not hospitalized, but I went to several hospitals to change meds. 

Ever since 2022, I feel like a different person. I think my function is deteriorating. I became lazy and depressed. I could not meet deadlines. I almost failed all classes. It kinda affected my concentration and attention. Very recently I have a hard time reading novels. (I am literature major and I used to read and write a lot)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, all these things being said, do you think I should my career?

I have always considered doing GRE or LSAT to fulfill my life goals. But unfortunately things got fucked up.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think I have to give up and change career? lmao

,bipolar,It’s now almost 3 AM on CHRISTMAS and I have work today which is grand in itself…..anyways I can’t sleep because I feel like people or someone is watching me. I’m not having any nightmares but I feel super unsettled and uncomfortable. When I was at work yesterday I kept hearing things and seeing things at the corner of my eye. I think I saw a dog running? I’ve also been feeling really burdeny lately not by anyone’s fault just my own. I don’t know why I feel this way but I just feel like no matter what I do I’ll always be struggling with something? I’m so fixated on the pressure of the failure of the future that it’s making me depressed. I’m 22 and trying to live life and get my license but I keep getting these thoughts or premonitions that once I get it I’ll die in a car accident?

,bipolar,"Most of the time I’m fine, I guess. I live on my own, can generally hold down a job, and “take care of myself”. That being said, it gets the better of me sometimes.

My friends were making jokes about my sexuality (I’m bisexual) and saying I would suck dicks for money if I was traveling and needed money.

The next level to this is that I was now in a terrible mood and on the verge of tears. I had to leave the dinner early because I was so upset and didn’t want my mood to ruin everyone else’s night.

,bipolar,"Hi, I’m new to this Reddit and I would love to just hear some thoughts and advice is greatly appreciated. 

I’m 31, F and has been going through life with a major depression diagnosis from age 15. 

This last year I was in the process of being possibly diagnosed with adhd, which branched out to possibly be cptsd. It’s been a long year of self discovery to say the least. 

But then I had an episode, which seems to most likely be hypomania, as I suddenly felt happy and not needing to sleep. I didn’t do anything drastic, I just felt happy which was new to me. I could go be with friends and people without being tired for days after, I liked myself, I didn’t ruminate or have my usual panic attacks. I didn’t hate myself, and I suddenly felt my libido coming back. 

When I couldn’t sleep and I was disassociating I understood something was wrong, and I’m in contact with my doctors and family and they suspect bipolar 2. 

Now that I’m no longer in hypomanic state, I’m very confused as life doesn’t feel the same anymore. I’ve gotten the taste of what happiness should feel like, so now I’ve stopped to force myself to do things to seem happy. But this makes me not able to function as an adult. I’ve lost my job (which weren’t a good match for me anyway, it was a bad environment for people with mental health struggles), and I should feel like a failure. But I don’t, I feel content with just existing. And this scares me. My whole life has changed after this experience, and now I feel like there’s a current of emotions and triggers flowing through me, but as long as I just try to stay calm and don’t push myself, it doesn’t affect me as much anymore. 

Is this normal? To go from being severely depressed (with ocd, social anxiety, panic attacks, ed, body dysmorphia and more) to suddenly just feeling content and suddenly confident and loving myself? I’ve done things I’ve been to scared to do my whole life (be open about myself, trust my friends, set boundaries, taken care of myself by speaking up, be confident in my body (I managed to reach the top while rock climbing for the first time in my life, I’ve been climbing for over a year)).

My friends and family tells me they don’t see me do anything that warrants me being hypomanic right now, and I don’t feel like I am right now. But I still have remnants of happiness and confidence, and it’s confusing.

A few days ago, I had a traumatic(?) experience. Since then, I have been feeling depressed. Last night when sitting outside with my partner, I became mute.

,bipolar,"I got my currently job on September of this year after a clusterfuck hiatus down spiral bullshit that happened during my last job where I end up hospitalized and unemployed for over 3 months.

I’m a registered nurse. This would be my first job acting as such. Before I had worked on other clinical settings but as a student or an assistant nurse. I was glad of having the opportunity more so because the initial gig was too good to be true. Then I got kicked out of my first role and forced to do something I didn’t want to and hate.

Three months in and I always try not to dwell on it. Try to change mi mindset every day to the fact that I’m learning a bunch of different things that otherwise I wouldn’t, that I live 15 mins from work and that I don’t expect to be there more than a year or two.

It is hard, very hard. So hard that there’s been days where I had to call in because I was in crisis. It has been hell for me to comply with my meds regime because of the crazy hours and too much to do to even stop for taking them plus they were making me have tremors and I hated it because patients would get scare and think that I was being nervous.


Calling in just got me into trouble now with Human Resources being concern of my repetitive absences. I tried to explain it to my supervisor and let them know that I can’t always provide evidence since my issue is a mental health condition and my doctors won’t be available to me unless I have an appointment which has been a pain in the ass to get one lately because I assume they are on vacation.

I haven’t been able to enjoy the holidays. Didn’t decorate or celebrated shit because I’ve been having rough days lately. I was only looking forward to New Year’s Eve because I was going to be off the next day and that’s gone as well. I just woke up with a message from my supervisor telling that he had to change my shift to a night one because people already called in sick for New Year’s. I was furious because I find it unfair for many reasons including him allowing it from so early and because I had already shared my mental health issues with him and instead of picking someone else he chose me. 

Of course I felt pressure to accept it because of my current situation with HR and because I’m new. But I’m not having a great year at all and certainly hope I could celebrate the fucker away with a bang and cant even do that.

Is so hard to explain yourself and what you’re going through without them believing you’re irresponsable or lazy. This whole shit has drained me to the point where now my body is manifesting physical symptoms.

,bipolar,"



Add oil to a fire

If I light up perhaps they won’t leave me

Harm of flopping like a fish in dry air

All I need is a snare to mistake for support 

Meet and dissolve with a ghost

Get worked up when I lie to myself

Never ill—just tore a gill and I can’t get up the fall

Won’t you peck at me?

Claw me like a monster

Call it help

Netted in a cow catcher

Frantic to have gills wet

When no support around

So bloated

You a tick to me

I feel like disease 

People don’t want my name

Just something to bleed

Unfair deal

Why must I be the one situated in need?

Only got heard when I folded like a chair

Polished knees

Branches with leaves are heading to dead and don’t bend but break

Better if stranded that tethered to another’s totem

Sometimes feel accepted when I’m treated as a bulletin board

Lonely on a steppe with no clan to claim

Get cornered when vulnerable

Polished as a floor

Sediments falling as confetti

Meshed to it 

Like combines over me to be taken off

Tear like cloth

Wrapped on branches as a charm

To cook and rattle as a snake 

Cannibalizing

&lt;p&gt;If I light up perhaps they won’t leave me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harm of flopping like a fish in dry air&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I need is a snare to mistake for support &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet and dissolve with a ghost&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get worked up when I lie to myself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never ill—just tore a gill and I can’t get up the fall&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Won’t you peck at me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claw me like a monster&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call it help&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netted in a cow catcher&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frantic to have gills wet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When no support around&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So bloated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You a tick to me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like disease &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t want my name&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just something to bleed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfair deal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only got heard when I folded like a chair&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polished knees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Branches with leaves are heading to dead and don’t bend but break&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better if stranded that tethered to another’s totem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes feel accepted when I’m treated as a bulletin board&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lonely on a steppe with no clan to claim&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get cornered when vulnerable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polished as a floor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sediments falling as confetti&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meshed to it &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like combines over me to be taken off&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tear like cloth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrapped on branches as a charm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cook and rattle as a snake &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cannibalizing &lt;/p&gt;

Lately I have been doing some research and found that Risperidone could cause lack of period. I stopped it cold turkey (I know) because I was scared, and when we retested my blood, prolactin was at a much safer range even though it was still very high.

,bipolar,"Me (32F) and my bf (31M) have been together for 3 years, living together for 6 months, and this summer we decided to get married. Our wedding is scheduled for April next year.

I was diagnosed bipolar when I was 16, and I have been suicidal for the last 7 years or so. When I was 16, I started a 7 year on and off relationship with someone who lied a lot and tried to manipulate me, and that relationship really changed me in a very negative way and affected my relationships ever since.

I agreed to marry my bf because I was absolutely sure that I would kill myself one day, and I wanted my bf to inherit my house. This has to do with the laws in our country but your partner is not your heir unless you are legally married and you cannot freely dispose of everything you own in a will. The house we live is mine (I have a mortgage, but I paid the down payment all alone), and I'm doing well financially but he is not.

I was never in love with my boyfriend, but I do love him; I started a relationship with him because I was lonely and I think he was lonely too. He is a kind hearted, supportive person. We have the same sense of humor and we share one specific interest, but that's it. I'm a bit of brainy person and I can't have any deep conversation with him because he sees the world in black and white terms and he doesn't read or try to learn. He's in a low paid job and believes he'll only advance in life if he wins the lottery. He lived with his parents until he was 31 and he never did any chores. He's still a bit hopeless around the house. He has his chores that he does half-assed so momma (me) doesn't scold him. He can't do a load of laundry or fix a lightbulb or use the stove. Our sex life is meh. I believe sexual compatibility can be worked on, but ours has only improved slightly, he's a bit clumsy and slow to take feedback and he once did something I don't like and wouldn't stop even when I told him. We're not even doing anything for our wedding because he can't afford it, we're only getting married at the registry. I wanted an elopement but he can't afford it. But he can afford spending thousands of $ on legos.

I think our relationship has nothing wrong, but nothing too good about it either. We're probably more friends than lovers and I think that is something awesome to have in old age, but I'm only 32.

About 2 months ago my meds changed, I'm now on lamotrigine 200mg + quetiapine 200mg. And for the first time in 7 yrs I am not suicidal. And I'm reconsidering if I want to get married or not.

I'm really not sure what I think. I'm sure I'm not in love with him but I do love him for who he is. I think maybe I can live without sex. 

I always get a bit depressed during Christmas time, and that may be clouding my judgement. I have a track record of jumping into relationships impulsively because I feel lonely, and I imagine people instead of taking them for who they are. But for the first time in my life I feel like I want to be alone. But I'm afraid I may get lonely again down the road. And my bf does keep me company, and except for not being very helpful around the house he's generally fun to live with.

I've been feeling lethargic, which is normal for me during this time of the year. However the meds are great because it's the first time in years that I feel sad but don't think about killing myself.

I'm sure that if I break up with my bf, he'll move back in with his family since he doesn't make enough money to support himself. His parents were dying to get him out of the house and he doesn't even have a bedroom in their home any longer. It really saddens me to think that he will be lonely and sad and living back home with his parents.

Our wedding is scheduled for April next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed bipolar when I was 16, and I have been suicidal for the last 7 years or so. When I was 16, I started a 7 year on and off relationship with someone who lied a lot and tried to manipulate me, and that relationship really changed me in a very negative way and affected my relationships ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agreed to marry my bf because I was absolutely sure that I would kill myself one day, and I wanted my bf to inherit my house. This has to do with the laws in our country but your partner is not your heir unless you are legally married and you cannot freely dispose of everything you own in a will. The house we live is mine (I have a mortgage, but I paid the down payment all alone), and I&amp;#39;m doing well financially but he is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was never in love with my boyfriend, but I do love him; I started a relationship with him because I was lonely and I think he was lonely too. He is a kind hearted, supportive person. We have the same sense of humor and we share one specific interest, but that&amp;#39;s it. I&amp;#39;m a bit of brainy person and I can&amp;#39;t have any deep conversation with him because he sees the world in black and white terms and he doesn&amp;#39;t read or try to learn. He&amp;#39;s in a low paid job and believes he&amp;#39;ll only advance in life if he wins the lottery. He lived with his parents until he was 31 and he never did any chores. He&amp;#39;s still a bit hopeless around the house. He has his chores that he does half-assed so momma (me) doesn&amp;#39;t scold him. He can&amp;#39;t do a load of laundry or fix a lightbulb or use the stove. Our sex life is meh. I believe sexual compatibility can be worked on, but ours has only improved slightly, he&amp;#39;s a bit clumsy and slow to take feedback and he once did something I don&amp;#39;t like and wouldn&amp;#39;t stop even when I told him. We&amp;#39;re not even doing anything for our wedding because he can&amp;#39;t afford it, we&amp;#39;re only getting married at the registry. I wanted an elopement but he can&amp;#39;t afford it. But he can afford spending thousands of $ on legos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think our relationship has nothing wrong, but nothing too good about it either. We&amp;#39;re probably more friends than lovers and I think that is something awesome to have in old age, but I&amp;#39;m only 32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 2 months ago my meds changed, I&amp;#39;m now on lamotrigine 200mg + quetiapine 200mg. And for the first time in 7 yrs I am not suicidal. And I&amp;#39;m reconsidering if I want to get married or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really not sure what I think. I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;m not in love with him but I do love him for who he is. I think maybe I can live without sex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always get a bit depressed during Christmas time, and that may be clouding my judgement. I have a track record of jumping into relationships impulsively because I feel lonely, and I imagine people instead of taking them for who they are. But for the first time in my life I feel like I want to be alone. But I&amp;#39;m afraid I may get lonely again down the road. And my bf does keep me company, and except for not being very helpful around the house he&amp;#39;s generally fun to live with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been feeling lethargic, which is normal for me during this time of the year. However the meds are great because it&amp;#39;s the first time in years that I feel sad but don&amp;#39;t think about killing myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure that if I break up with my bf, he&amp;#39;ll move back in with his family since he doesn&amp;#39;t make enough money to support himself. His parents were dying to get him out of the house and he doesn&amp;#39;t even have a bedroom in their home any longer. It really saddens me to think that he will be lonely and sad and living back home with his parents. I think he has potential but he&amp;#39;s not advancing in life because he has a victim mentality and can&amp;#39;t think critically about himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So...I really have no idea what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

Just wanted to jot down my own thoughts, feel free to share your own journey. 

During the summer I had a mental breakdown (this is what my therapist called it) which led to me taking a decent attempt at my life. 

What followed was months of depression and a whole lot of suicidal ideation. I honestly didn't think I would get out of that hole/couldn't see a way out of it.

Very slowly, with therapy sessions every week, I'm at the stage today where I can breathe without feeling suffocated. I've gone from a very high safety risk to a very low risk with little to no suicidal ideation. 

I never thought I would get to the stage of looking forward to what the future brings. (No job, on disability, with half a degree) but I no longer care about all of that stuff. It took me 27 years to finally start caring about my own self.

,bipolar,"Regardless of how well I'm doing, regardless of how successful I am in managing life, projects and people.... I will take the first chance to dissociate. By dissociate, I mean getting holed up at home and simply shutting off reality - not checking my phone, emails, not answering anything - and sleeping excessively or just devoting my waking hours to learning more about some of my obsessions, daydreaming or binge-watching shows. Anyway, it's always an activity that's not integral to my life in any way. I stop reading, learning, communicating, working, writing... and just exist on another level, untouchable, unfocused, unbothered by Life. I live for that feeling of being disconnected. It's my ultimate fantasy and greatest reward.

Yeah, that's how it feels... as if though I have succeeded at hiding from space and time, and god-awful messaging apps.

Actually, even on a good day (being productive, active, etc), in the evening I must have an hour or two of total dissociation, just existing in a fantasy world, before going to bed. It's like I need to wash off reality from me.

This is causing shitstorms in my life... I forget to reply something important to someone, I tend to forget or cancel my client appointments, I might overlook a super crucial email... it makes me look flaky, uninterested, irresponsible.... and I hate that, especially now as I'm doing all I can to rebuild a worthy life for myself.... but it happens all the time... it's like a super strong need within me, it's like I can't live without taking pauses from this world. It scares me. And it makes me really sad.

I’m 19 years old and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder earlier this year. I’ve noticed when I go into episodes I leave…like physically run away and it scares the shit out of my family and sometimes even myself, when it happens it’s like I am a different person and can’t control myself. My family will frantically be calling and texting me but I just won’t answer them and make them think something awful happened to me. My most recent and most dangerous one happened tonight. I walked probably about 30 minutes in pitch black darkness on a busy highway from my grandparents house to my house: everyone was frantically calling me but I ignored everything. It all happened over a fight I had with my mother and sister. I’ve also had a pretty rough few days.
Does anyone else do this? I’m worried that one day I do something like this and get myself in a legit dangerous situation. I scared my mother so much she won’t speak to me.

I recently came out of a manic episode that lasted about a month or a bit longer from September to October. Since then I’ve been dealing with large amounts of irritability; arguably before the episode as well I think. I don’t believe I payed good enough attention to this until after the episode. The anger I felt during the episode was… aggressive. I had to create a safety plan because I wanted to hurt someone and was soooo mad at my therapist- who I literally love😔. I made such horrible decisions during my episode that don’t fit me at all. I’ve been feeling the effects of that recently with the mental analysis eating me up.

I cannot shake the anger though. I stare at people when upset because I can’t calm down. If I can’t speak I still try to convey a sense of control. I want to squeeze glass cups in my hand when I think of things that anger me (I typically analyze things that have happened when eating bc I don’t eat with electronics around, and we only have glass cups).

,bipolar,"I was just recently diagnosed with Bipolar II and I'm still learning so I apologize if I there are things I don't get right or things I misunderstand. I'm also sorry if this post comes out weird formatting-wise, I am not super familiar with Reddit. Final apology, I did not find any duplicates of these questions but I apologize if I maybe just missed them.

I have two real questions about my depressive episodes.

My first, is there a difference between a depressive episode and just experiencing sad things in life?I have been really depressed for a while. It's been about the same amount of time as previous depressive episodes except where those didn't have a reason, I believe this one has come as a direct result of a problem I've been dealing with with a really close friend.

I know that not every time I get sad is a depressive episode. And I know that people without bipolar disorder get sad. But is being depressed and miserable for weeks because of a problem that's been persisting for weeks a depressive episode? Or am I just sad? Does that make sense?

And second is about insomnia. In this depression I've been dealing with for the last couple months, I haven't been sleeping much at all. The most I've slept on any given night is just under four hours and even that was kind of a miracle.

I'm not doing anything stimulating, all devices are powered off and put away, I just stare at the ceiling for hours. Sometimes thinking, sometimes not thinking at all. I am constantly exhausted but no matter how tired I am, I cannot sleep even a little bit.

I&amp;#39;m also sorry if this post comes out weird formatting-wise, I am not super familiar with Reddit. Final apology, I did not find any duplicates of these questions but I apologize if I maybe just missed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two real questions about my depressive episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first, is there a difference between a depressive episode and just experiencing sad things in life?I have been really depressed for a while. It&amp;#39;s been about the same amount of time as previous depressive episodes except where those didn&amp;#39;t have a reason, I believe this one has come as a direct result of a problem I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with with a really close friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that not every time I get sad is a depressive episode. And I know that people without bipolar disorder get sad. But is being depressed and miserable for weeks because of a problem that&amp;#39;s been persisting for weeks a depressive episode? Or am I just sad? Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And second is about insomnia. In this depression I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with for the last couple months, I haven&amp;#39;t been sleeping much at all. The most I&amp;#39;ve slept on any given night is just under four hours and even that was kind of a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not doing anything stimulating, all devices are powered off and put away, I just stare at the ceiling for hours. Sometimes thinking, sometimes not thinking at all. I am constantly exhausted but no matter how tired I am, I cannot sleep even a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried melatonin, magnesium, and every other thing I could find on the internet, but nothing&amp;#39;s helped. And I can&amp;#39;t do prescription sleep medication because I have a history of abusing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is is this normal? Is there anything I can do? Or do I just kind of have to ride it out? I&amp;#39;m sure everyone is different, but I would love to know how anyone facing something similar has helped.&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"I feel like I've just been slapped in the face by a depression ghost. Like it just snuck up behind me, knocked the wind out of my lungs and sucked every atom of goodness from my body in literal seconds.

For context, I was diagnosed bipolar three years ago and have managed it successfully with meds. I can work late, stress moderately, enjoy the occassional drink, and even pull off the odd all-nighter, all without any serious shift in mood. 

But after spending most of today with friends and family, laughing over a few beers, I got home, walked into my bedroom and just felt the life drain out of me.

I very nearly forgot what this kind of depression felt like.
It's this thick cloud of darkness that swallows you up. 
An unbearable weight of despair, from which only thoughts of worthlessness and paranoia can grow. 
A sadness so deep, without reason or explanation, that it ignites fear - fear that it cannot be justified or controlled.
Fear that no one will understand, or would want to understand. 
Fear that I am alone. 
I look in the mirror and wonder why I even exist. Everything around me is grey and lifeless and I feel useless and pathetic. I start to believe that my life contributes nothing to this world and that my existence is a bane to all those around me.

Its been a while since I last felt this way and I have no idea what triggered this episode.. But previous experience has taught me a few coping techniques:

- Sleep is usually always the best remedy. 
- As painful as it feels now, its usually less so by tomorrow. 
- And an early dose of (prescribed) quetiapine can bring sleep on much, much quicker. 
- If the above doesn't work then I know to call my psychiatrist for help. 
Knowing all of this is usually the reassurance I need to get me through the day.


I actually came here to remind myself that depression is a familiar burden shared by many in this sub. I remember that I am not alone, and that in itself is a relief. 
I also wanted to document this experience for myself, as a kind of reassuring memo for future episodes. But now that it's written, I've decided to post it instead. And maybe..hopefully.. my shared experience might ease the burden of another bipolar soul in need.

,bipolar,"The last few days have been Christmas celebrations for me and it me realize that I really don't like my family. My parents are divorced (and my dad's absent) so for the first time in the years since covid I really saw my dad around Christmas time. My stepmom invited me to her family’s Christmas celebration and I thought it would be fun so I went. I talked to people and most importantly I talked to my stepbrother—who I haven't really talked to in years—about my bipolar. He was so nice and understanding but not in a fake way, he was just honest. The rest of her family was also so nice and just spoke to me like I was a part of their family. And they spoke to each other nicely as well, and not in a fake nice way just nice. And when they poked fun at each other it just felt like jokes. It was nice.

Then I went to my real mom’s family’s Christmas. It was horrible. Half the people didn't get anyone anything and everyone was kinda just mean like they always are. Some things specifically were said that made me feel shitty—like literally about me—and it kinda ruined my mood for the night. The next day at home was like every single day: Everyone was angry and rude and making me feel horrible for just existing or just ignoring each other.

I just realized that I really don't like my family. Like at all. They're all mean and know it (like say that they are) and just don't care. I mean it was like I felt unconditional acceptance for one day and my entire view of my life and the people in it changed. There was just such a juxtaposition between everything and it kinda makes me angry.

,bipolar,"So, I'm feeling desire for ""bad"" things. Like things I limit myself or have limits on. Because I view them as negative or that they could be detrimental to me. 

For example, I've never had a cigarette in my life, don't want to start, have sworn them off because everyone growing up chain smoked and it disgusts me. But the last few weeks I've had the thought EVERY time I go to a gas station ""maybe I should buy some cigarettes or a vape"" and I feel ashamed immediately after. Today, I wanted to buy scratch offs. Which I know aren't as bad and every year or two I will buy some, but I try not to. And there's tons of other things I desire or am slightly giving in to that aren't as ""good"" for me. Like super horny and taking risks with that. But the cigarettes and scratch offs are new thoughts. 

I'm doing good things more, too, though. Like, I've started working out a little more. I'm drinking less (at home at least). Doing more crafts, I'm finally practicing makeup and hair stuff again. I got a water drinking app that's been helping. Like still doing good things and keeping pretty consistent the last few weeks. 

But it's like my brain wants to just break every rule I have and undo any good stuff and do all these ""bad"" things. It's so frustrating. I've worked really hard my whole life to try to control, try to maintain at least decent health if no energy for really good. But like, why all of a sudden am I constantly itching for these random things? I'm feeling a bit depressed and lonely and lost lately, but am still going out and hanging and talking to friends.

These impulsive/intrusive thoughts just itch at the back of my mind. I don't know what to do or how I should feel about myself. I've also had a lot of suicidal thoughts that I've been managing so I'm wondering if maybe this is my brain trying to still self destruct because I'm not doing that. It's just making it hard to take preventive action to keep myself in a good place.

&lt;p&gt;I know whatever is going on is not healthy. I start a new therapy regime in a week or two and I hope it isn’t just mindful breathing exercises.  I want some real help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eat well, I have hobbies, I have coping strategies, I have a professional life. I can keep those things intact and have learned how to manage my emotions to the point it doesn’t interfere much with those aspects anymore but interpersonal relationships are destroying me. I just don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"hello, this is my first time posting here. i (22F) was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2 which honestly has been really hard for me to accept. i haven't taken medication out of fears of 1) weight-gain (i have an ED) and 2) that i'm not actually bipolar. 

my mom (57F) and i do not get along. i see myself as a very level-headed person, while she just seems outright delusional most of the time. she always yelled at me over random unimportant things as a child. insults my appearance a lot, and overall was always hostile while I was growing up. this has caused me to resent her a lot, which is hard for me to admit. I am very irritable and rude toward her, but i'm not quite sure if the irritability is a bipolar thing or if its just because i simply do not like her. 

today, we had a huge fight. she called me out for being rude all the time, and i ended up just telling her straight-up that i resented her and listed all the things that made me resent her over the years. she denied all of it and said i was making things up, which i am not. she started crying because she couldn't handle my brutal honesty.

however, no matter how many times i try to communicate how she has made me feel, she always denies it. straight up tries to gaslight me into thinking she's never done anything wrong. but every hour she screams about something, complains, yells, freaks out over nothing. it's exhausting.

so later today, she sends me a huge text basically saying that i need to start taking meds for my bipolar because it's making me irritable and that i'm ""making mountains out of mole hills,"" which she also attributes to BD. **but honestly, i feel like she is using my recent diagnosis to dismiss my feelings and words to make her feel better about herself.** 

so i guess my question is this: **how do you differentiate between genuine emotions vs bipolar irritation/paranoia?** i know i am not paranoid about the way she has treated me because my non-BD siblings feel the same way as me about the things she has done. i feel like i'm going crazy because i feel like my emotions are not irrational considering her words and actions toward me, but her dismissal of my emotions because of my recent diagnosis is making me second guess myself. what's real and what isn't? it's all just very confusing :( any advice?

My kids look at me with fear first, then sympathy later. I feel like a pathetic excuse for a human being and father. Treatment doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be helping, as I just feel like I&amp;#39;m getting worse. We&amp;#39;re doing therapymore often again. We&amp;#39;ve adjusted the meds. I still feel like I&amp;#39;m getting progressively worse. I feel like my family would be better off without me always losing control and screaming about things that are way less significant than how I&amp;#39;m feeling at the time. I hate feeling stuck in my own mind. I hate feeling like such a burden to everyone. Idk what to do at this point. I just want to give up. I would do anything to make this permanently stop. To have more than one good day in a row. To stop having my mood swings ruin what has been a great holiday outside the things I have no control over. At what point am I allowed to just give up? It feels like trying is pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been on edge about everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my wife has been so sweet and supportive. I don’t think she knows she has saved my life, again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m ready for better days.&lt;/p&gt;

But I have no excitement anymore, no ambition, no taste of life. I don’t want to work anymore. I heard that it is because of medication ( I am on lithium and Wellbutrin). I have strong thoughts to stop taking them. 

What do you think guys? Does anyone feel the same?
