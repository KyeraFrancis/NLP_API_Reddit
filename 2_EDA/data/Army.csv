,Army,"Long time lurker here, figured I'd finally post.

Been a nasty girl since 2019 and it's been a complete waste of time. Am a 1LT and I don't know anything about the Army or my job (35A). The most they've ever tasked me with is figuring out the weather. The couple of times they've asked me to do more, I did a whole bunch of work, just to be told to disregard.Ive just taken up the unofficial job of going to bat for soldiers nobody wants to listen to.

I dropped a CAD packet and it got approved. Am now waiting to get scrolled. I spoke to a Captain who will receive my scroll and cut my orders. She advised she has duty stations in Korea, Hood, and Bliss.

From my time spent lurking, Hood sounds like a mess so if I get to choose, I'll avoid it. Bliss sounds better but not by a whole lot. Korea sounds like the way to go.

The sticking point is promotion boards. If I get in early 2024, I'll be just 4 months or so from O-3. She expressed some hesitation on sending me to Korea with my promotion so close. 

I can guess at why but I don't understand enough about this process to understand it. Why couldn't I just promote in Korea? Why would promoting stateside be an easier process?

She said she could delay my promotion by 18mo but given the pay difference that sounds like a major L.

,Army,"I'm summoning those of you who are *only* **currently active duty** or **retired**. 

This is about a topic of a veteran wanting to go back in, active duty and looking for your outtake.

The reason why I'm seeking opinions only from active duty or retired veterans is because there are too many biased opinions of us veterans when the topic is brought up about *going back into the military*. Yeah, I get it, going back in, is a stupid idea - to you? I get it, ok. But I already heard your reasons, let me hear it from the updated/current sources that knows what the fuck is going on, right now.

So. I'm a veteran. I wanna go back into the military, as an officer. I did four years in the military, enlisted,, infantry (3 combat tours), got out, went to school using my GI bill and got my degree. The main goal prior to me even getting out, was to go to school, get my degree and go back in as an officer. I started contracting overseas as soon as I got out and did my schooling online. Made bank. The whole money chase is over for me, I made great fucking money high six figures but it didn't bring me happiness. Job felt missionless/empty. Along the way, met many veterans talk about VA VA VA VA. Did my VA shit, slightly forgetting the idea of going back in and only claimed minimal stuff. I have 30% disability now with a possible option for a higher rating (if i claim more, I only claimed my knees). I've been out for some time now, about 5 years now going on 6. I'm fit and live an active life style. I am now in a job doing what I got a degree in. This idea of going back in has stuck with me and even working with the military now but the AF, I still can think of myself going back in. (Side note: I can't ask this question to the military I work with right now, AF, because these mf'ers are a different breed. Gauges, beards, get off early, don't police call - just a different fucking bread) and I get it. Times are different now. Whatever, merry christmas, doesn't phase me. I just can't ask this question because the AF lifestyle is fucking different and I'm not looking to join the AF. I already tried :). Fun fact, if you've been out for 5 years, you can't ever enlist. Second fun fact, going officer in the AF is a min 2 year wait. And they are fucking selective on who they choose. I'm not that god damn smart. I wasn't stellar in college, I did enough to get my fucking degree. And they base their selection on additional shit like voulenteer time and other side shit. Gotta pass. Anyway back to my story. The idea of going back in has stuck with me pretty much since getting out. I do like the military lifestyle, I like being on base, I like all aspects of the military. The purpose of my goal here, is because I want a retirement. I've met countless veterans while contracting overseas who were retired, getting their retirement checks, and VA, plus the check for work. I always envied that. I don't want to retire in the US. Thats my point. Sure, VA is nice if you get a high rating but when it comes time for me to retire. I don't wanna HAVE to work if I don't need to. Having 2 guaranteed paychecks, plus if I retire as a civ somewhere, so 3, and when I get to the age for social securtity, thats 4 checks, sure as hell sounds a lot better than just 1 (VA) or 2 (VA) and a (CIV) job and then later SS. Plus the VA never really has anything saying the VA the VA is forever or at least I dont know if it exists, I cant find it, and with the amount of veterans getting out on a daily basis and claiming VA, getting 100%, fuck I don't even know what the system is going to look like in the next 10 years. I would hate to be relying soley on that and then it ends up stopping or some shit. Thats scary. I'm okay with the current changes the military has shifted to. I've been out long enough,, and worked in enough enviorments that Im well adjusted. To be nice. I'm not a hard ass; knife hander, all that shit. But I am about the military - I like the lifestyle, fitness standards of having to PT every fucking day, I like the idea of moving around consistently, while having a job for stability. The hours and all that shit, late nights, duty, doesn't phase me. I'm over it - It's the military. And I get all that shit.

Clearly you see my mind is made up here already, I'm just looking for some non-biased kick back on my *idea here.*

I guess what I'm trying to really ask here is. How do you like the military right now? (And I know everyone's opinion is different or going to be different on this but from the current sources, whats going on now?). Are you regretting staying in right now - why, or did you regret retiring? What do you think about my idea here?

Basically I'm just thinking - and trying to realistically have an apporach or prepation about my plan/idea here of going back in. It's like if you have your boys and they tell you that chick is bad news, but you go through it anyway and later regret it, and wish you would have listened. Like I'm essentially just romanticizing about the idea of going back in, as an officer, to end up, maybe not enjoying being back in for whatever reason. Then regretting why I gave up all these other options that I could have, had.  


Let me hear it.",t2_gp02qzmsq,False,,0,False,Question for those currently Active Duty or Retired,[],r/army,False,7.0,,0,,,False,t3_18pb3wn,False,dark,0.62,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1703354264.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m summoning those of you who are &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;currently active duty&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;retired&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about a topic of a veteran wanting to go back in, active duty and looking for your outtake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I&amp;#39;m seeking opinions only from active duty or retired veterans is because there are too many biased opinions of us veterans when the topic is brought up about &lt;em&gt;going back into the military&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah, I get it, going back in, is a stupid idea - to you? I get it, ok. But I already heard your reasons, let me hear it from the updated/current sources that knows what the fuck is going on, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. I&amp;#39;m a veteran. I wanna go back into the military, as an officer. I did four years in the military, enlisted,, infantry (3 combat tours), got out, went to school using my GI bill and got my degree. The main goal prior to me even getting out, was to go to school, get my degree and go back in as an officer. I started contracting overseas as soon as I got out and did my schooling online. Made bank. The whole money chase is over for me, I made great fucking money high six figures but it didn&amp;#39;t bring me happiness. Job felt missionless/empty. Along the way, met many veterans talk about VA VA VA VA. Did my VA shit, slightly forgetting the idea of going back in and only claimed minimal stuff. I have 30% disability now with a possible option for a higher rating (if i claim more, I only claimed my knees). I&amp;#39;ve been out for some time now, about 5 years now going on 6. I&amp;#39;m fit and live an active life style. I am now in a job doing what I got a degree in. This idea of going back in has stuck with me and even working with the military now but the AF, I still can think of myself going back in. (Side note: I can&amp;#39;t ask this question to the military I work with right now, AF, because these mf&amp;#39;ers are a different breed. Gauges, beards, get off early, don&amp;#39;t police call - just a different fucking bread) and I get it. Times are different now. Whatever, merry christmas, doesn&amp;#39;t phase me. I just can&amp;#39;t ask this question because the AF lifestyle is fucking different and I&amp;#39;m not looking to join the AF. I already tried :). Fun fact, if you&amp;#39;ve been out for 5 years, you can&amp;#39;t ever enlist. Second fun fact, going officer in the AF is a min 2 year wait. And they are fucking selective on who they choose. I&amp;#39;m not that god damn smart. I wasn&amp;#39;t stellar in college, I did enough to get my fucking degree. And they base their selection on additional shit like voulenteer time and other side shit. Gotta pass. Anyway back to my story. The idea of going back in has stuck with me pretty much since getting out. I do like the military lifestyle, I like being on base, I like all aspects of the military. The purpose of my goal here, is because I want a retirement. I&amp;#39;ve met countless veterans while contracting overseas who were retired, getting their retirement checks, and VA, plus the check for work. I always envied that. I don&amp;#39;t want to retire in the US. Thats my point. Sure, VA is nice if you get a high rating but when it comes time for me to retire. I don&amp;#39;t wanna HAVE to work if I don&amp;#39;t need to. Having 2 guaranteed paychecks, plus if I retire as a civ somewhere, so 3, and when I get to the age for social securtity, thats 4 checks, sure as hell sounds a lot better than just 1 (VA) or 2 (VA) and a (CIV) job and then later SS. Plus the VA never really has anything saying the VA the VA is forever or at least I dont know if it exists, I cant find it, and with the amount of veterans getting out on a daily basis and claiming VA, getting 100%, fuck I don&amp;#39;t even know what the system is going to look like in the next 10 years.

We've got great leadership, seemed like his personal life was going great, no obvious signs that he might be depressed or anything, and just out of nowhere he kills himself.

I'm fucking sick of loosing someone almost every year and by the time I've had time to grieve someone else passes away.

,Army,"Good morning, Team.

Context:

I'm on holiday leave from basic. I caught up with my employer and was given favorable news. I'm in the running for a promotion upon returning from OCS.

I chose to drill out of a unit 3 1/2 hours away in N.C. anticipating I would relocate to that particular area for a career opportunity. I was thinking long-term/big picture.

After being made aware of the prospects, I thought it best to be pragmatic, and drill with a unit closer to my residence in W.V./current employer (whether I get promoted or not). I'm happy with my civilian circumstances.

Question(s):

1. Is it possible to switch units during/immediately after IET?

2. If so, what would be the procedure?

My recruiter recommended I speak with the Reserve liaison at basic assuming the drill sergeants grant my request for an appointment. I figure it wouldn't hurt to ask the group for feedback.

If it doesn't work, I'm more than willing to make the drive without complaint. It wouldn't be the end of the world, but I'd like to explore any possibility of drilling in my home state.

I chose MP as my branch.

Any thoughts would be appreciated. I hope all is well.

I&amp;#39;ve had to buy stuff just for them to do it with me. On top of any cost i had for the plane tickets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say they&amp;#39;re doing stuff like gift shopping or finals. But I finished my shopping and classes (though I have less classes) when I was across the country before coming. They act like they care a lot about me coming but it seems I just end up staring at my phone or playing videogames unless I&amp;#39;m asking them to do something. Which typically gets an &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m too busy&amp;quot; in return. &lt;/p&gt;

Im on leave and ended up smoking, no excuse, don't need pity, just honestly need help. My ambition for myself has gone and I feel like now I have no reason to continue my life in the Army anymore.

,Army,"Informational Post for you transitioning folks

For anyone unaware there exists a field in the civilian world called Biomedical Equipment Technician or BMET (there's also a MOS for it that offers some of the best training in the industry so reclassing for it to go reserves or guard is an option as well). You work in a hospital setting repairing and PMCSing medical equipment, everything from hospital bed to MRI machines. You do NOT need a degree to work in this field but having one does make you more marketable. That being said if you are looking to get into a technical field with little to no experience this is a good option.

Firstly there is the college portion. If you choose, you can use your skillbridge to pursue a 2 year degree or certificate as a BMET though the College of Biomedical Equipment Technology. It is completely remote and is done online. Furthermore they will work with hospitals in your area, (or area you plan to relocate to upon ETS) to find you OJT as well, but is not required to complete the course. The President of the college is an Army veteran himself and the school is very much set up to accommodate military service members. That being said, even if you don't purse it as a skillbridge the scheduling works where you could potentially (given you role/MOS) attend the college during your transition window without it being on skillbridge.[https://cbet.edu/programs/](https://cbet.edu/programs/)

Secondly, the company I will be working for, Trimedx, is an independent service provider and has contracts with hospitals all over the US. They also offer a skillbridge internship.

If you have any questions about the field, the college, Trimedx, or even other companies, please feel free to reach out and DM me any questions you might have.

,Army,"I need help and advice about a serious situation my brother is in. I will try to provide the least information because I am afraid for his safety. He enlisted a few years ago and now lives overseas. He married another soldier not a year ago. None of his relatives know much about this person nor have met them in person.

He's being a victim of narcissistic abuse and it has become physical against him. His life has already been in danger. I convinced him to talk to his superiors which he did, but I have strong suspicion this may have backfired in the way that his abuser may have convinced him to get back together and take the fall for any reports he made. I believe even his career may be in danger. 

He's normally very communicative which drastically changed after the last violent event against him by his partner. I also have strong reasons to believe his phone is being monitored by his partner. I know for a fact that there has been times in which his social media posts and even text message replies have been done by his partner and not him. I am certain that since the last violent event against him occurred, his communication with his family is being monitored.

He's a sweet, kind person and unfortunately, this might make him the perfect person to be the victim of this. I not only fear for him facing consequences that do not belong to him, but also for his life and safety.   


What should I do? Should I call someone (his superiors or FAP)  to tell them what I know? Would that do any good? How can I make sure he's safe and that he has a support system that would understand narcissistic abuse and work with men who go through it? I will appreciate any advice and knowledge.

,Army,"We met at the beginning of June, and have been talking every day since. He's in the US, and I'm in the UK. He's also a sergeant in the military, so he's busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven't phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I'm too anxious to, but he's said that he'd find the time and we could whenever I'm ready. But we've sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven't made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.

But I don't know whether that's going to be possible now.

Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn't feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he's 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn't respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he'd been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn't be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn't have a right to know as we weren't officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.

Everything was fine for a while.

But then he didn't respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he'd had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He's had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I'm aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven't heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He's just completely disappeared on me, and I'm absolutely terrified.

I don't have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I'd never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn't big on social media), so there's no way I can ""stalk"" him to somehow find their details either. I've tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there's nothing.

He's a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn't lie about any of this. I really don't want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.

He&amp;#39;s in the US, and I&amp;#39;m in the UK. He&amp;#39;s also a sergeant in the military, so he&amp;#39;s busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven&amp;#39;t phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I&amp;#39;m too anxious to, but he&amp;#39;s said that he&amp;#39;d find the time and we could whenever I&amp;#39;m ready. But we&amp;#39;ve sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven&amp;#39;t made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t know whether that&amp;#39;s going to be possible now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn&amp;#39;t feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he&amp;#39;s 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn&amp;#39;t respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he&amp;#39;d been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn&amp;#39;t have a right to know as we weren&amp;#39;t officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything was fine for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then he didn&amp;#39;t respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he&amp;#39;d had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He&amp;#39;s had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I&amp;#39;m aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven&amp;#39;t heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He&amp;#39;s just completely disappeared on me, and I&amp;#39;m absolutely terrified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I&amp;#39;d never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn&amp;#39;t big on social media), so there&amp;#39;s no way I can &amp;quot;stalk&amp;quot; him to somehow find their details either. I&amp;#39;ve tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there&amp;#39;s nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn&amp;#39;t lie about any of this. I really don&amp;#39;t want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s been in there way too long for a heart attack, he should&amp;#39;ve been out by now. I have no idea what to do and I feel like I can&amp;#39;t cope, I need him back.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"Informational Post for you transitioning folks

For anyone unaware there exists a field in the civilian world called Biomedical Equipment Technician or BMET (there's also a MOS for it that offers some of the best training in the industry so reclassing for it to go reserves or guard is an option as well). You work in a hospital setting repairing and PMCSing medical equipment, everything from hospital bed to MRI machines. You do NOT need a degree to work in this field but having one does make you more marketable. That being said if you are looking to get into a technical field with little to no experience this is a good option.

Firstly there is the college portion. If you choose, you can use your skillbridge to pursue a 2 year degree or certificate as a BMET though the College of Biomedical Equipment Technology. It is completely remote and is done online. Furthermore they will work with hospitals in your area, (or area you plan to relocate to upon ETS) to find you OJT as well, but is not required to complete the course. The President of the college is an Army veteran himself and the school is very much set up to accommodate military service members. That being said, even if you don't purse it as a skillbridge the scheduling works where you could potentially (given you role/MOS) attend the college during your transition window without it being on skillbridge.[https://cbet.edu/programs/](https://cbet.edu/programs/)

Secondly, the company I will be working for, Trimedx, is an independent service provider and has contracts with hospitals all over the US. They also offer a skillbridge internship.

If you have any questions about the field, the college, Trimedx, or even other companies, please feel free to reach out and DM me any questions you might have.

,Army,"I need help and advice about a serious situation my brother is in. I will try to provide the least information because I am afraid for his safety. He enlisted a few years ago and now lives overseas. He married another soldier not a year ago. None of his relatives know much about this person nor have met them in person.

He's being a victim of narcissistic abuse and it has become physical against him. His life has already been in danger. I convinced him to talk to his superiors which he did, but I have strong suspicion this may have backfired in the way that his abuser may have convinced him to get back together and take the fall for any reports he made. I believe even his career may be in danger. 

He's normally very communicative which drastically changed after the last violent event against him by his partner. I also have strong reasons to believe his phone is being monitored by his partner. I know for a fact that there has been times in which his social media posts and even text message replies have been done by his partner and not him. I am certain that since the last violent event against him occurred, his communication with his family is being monitored.

He's a sweet, kind person and unfortunately, this might make him the perfect person to be the victim of this. I not only fear for him facing consequences that do not belong to him, but also for his life and safety.   


What should I do? Should I call someone (his superiors or FAP)  to tell them what I know? Would that do any good? How can I make sure he's safe and that he has a support system that would understand narcissistic abuse and work with men who go through it? I will appreciate any advice and knowledge.

,Army,"We met at the beginning of June, and have been talking every day since. He's in the US, and I'm in the UK. He's also a sergeant in the military, so he's busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven't phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I'm too anxious to, but he's said that he'd find the time and we could whenever I'm ready. But we've sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven't made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.

But I don't know whether that's going to be possible now.

Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn't feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he's 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn't respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he'd been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn't be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn't have a right to know as we weren't officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.

Everything was fine for a while.

But then he didn't respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he'd had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He's had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I'm aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven't heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He's just completely disappeared on me, and I'm absolutely terrified.

I don't have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I'd never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn't big on social media), so there's no way I can ""stalk"" him to somehow find their details either. I've tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there's nothing.

He's a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn't lie about any of this. I really don't want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.

I was active duty, ETS'd to the IRR for a short period, and joined a USAR unit in late 2021. My contract time on the DA3540 was for ""3 years.""

Fast-forward to now and I've filed a PAR and discussed the issue with my units retention NCO, but our RPAC office hasn't kept me updated on the process, and I had to push just for them to say they only partially had my paperwork and needed ""enlistment forms, like your original DD-4.""

,Army,"Currently AD 15Y getting medboarded for bilateral wrist issues ( Left wrist ECU subluxation and Right wrist TFCC tear) during the medboard process I was in a car accident and while bracing before impact, the energy transfered through my right hand to my wrist, shoulder blade and neck. My usability of my right wrist and hand has now worsened. PEBLO has ""OKed"" me for surgery on the left as it is my dominant hand and on the waitlist pending updated mri of my right wrist to see if further damage is present. 

My question is should hold off the surgery until I get out through the VA? I will eventually need surgery on both wrists. My mum used to work for the VA hospital and knows the horror stories of veterans waiting for care. I've heard improvements have been done through the news but I am sure going through this community would give me better insight.

Also, my plan is to get out medically from army and go back to school via Gi bill and get my 2nd bachelors in advertising. I was originally going to work on helicopters components in line with my MOS, but considering my wrist issues I feel it would be safer to return to my creative nature.

Potential options I am weighing:

° Get out no surgery, get care through VA eventually.
° Get surgery on left, get out, get care through VA eventually for right wrist.
° Get surgery on both wrists, get out with lower VA percentage or possibly found fit for duty.

Please let me know your experiences and advice.

,Army,"How long did your conditional release take?

So a little back story. I finished my active duty contract in February of 2022 and rolled into the reserves. So I’ve been in the reserves since February of 2022. I signed a 4 year contract so it ends in 2026. A few months in, I realized i made a mistake. The reserves is ass. But I kept trucking on. I’ve been struggling alot financially, and mentally. I was gonna wait until the end of the contract to go back active but i dont want to wait that long so I am about to start the process of a conditional release. I know it can take awhile but if anyone has experienced it, how long did yours take? Any advice you can give me? Also if you got a bonus, did you pay it back? And if you’re married to an AD soldier, can you be at the same duty station or does the big army send you wherever once active again?

Are they lonelier than normal? 80-90% go to see family so I'm not sure that's it. Do they not want to see family? Don't like their hometown? Are they out of whack with a different routine or lost without a routine?

I'm just trying to pinpoint what it is about this time of year that makes people extra depressed and/or suicidal. 

To be honest I'm just trying to figure it out for myself at the moment and see why I'm struggling so much these past couple of months. This week it's gotten worse and of course I'm away from my duty location. I may have to use some resources that I'd rather not use. I'm really trying to just make it through the week.

,Army,"Hey y’all, using a burner coz people I know follow my other acc. I’m enlisting in the army sometime in the coming weeks but I’m having second thoughts due to the current political state of the US. I’ve always dreamed of being in the armed forces, but I don’t want to risk being in the military if someone who literally committed treason gets elected. Does the president really have that much of an effect on people in the military? I know it’s kind of a stupid question but I’m genuinely curious.

,Army,"I’ve never posted on Reddit before, so I hope it’s ok I ask for some lenience. I’ve been with my boyfriend for two years, and I’ve never been more in love with a person. I am 19, he is 20, and I know I’m young and naive, but I can’t imagine a future without him. I’ve known since meeting him he’s wanted to join the army. It’s always been a hard subject to talk about, as I never supported it. I have strong negative opinions about the army (I’m trying to learn more, as I want to be more comfortable when he speaks about it) and he also knows this. For a long time we’d procrastinate and avoid talking about the army because I didn’t wanna hear it. 

About a year ago he dropped out of college because he just figured he couldn’t do it. He had a good job, and it wasn’t like he had no where to go. He has a loving family, a friend group, a good job, a girlfriend. But I know he’s always wanted to do this. I know it’s something bigger than me, and it wasn’t fair of me to try to convince him otherwise, to just be an EMT or a cop, anything but leaving me for the army. I couldn’t stand the thought. But he went to the recruiters and after a lot of back and forth papers on medical issues he finally was accepted. He only had ten days before leaving. And two days before he left, he told me he signed for six years instead of four, though he had previously told me four. It broke my heart. In BCT he sent me letters, telling me how much he loved me. I never responded, it was too painful. I’d write drafts but never send them. 

When he got to AIT he called, and we talked for hours, FaceTiming everyday in his personal time. It felt good. Having him home for the holidays feels intoxicating, I’ve missed him so much and every second I’m around him I feel high off of him. But I know he is leaving again soon. I don’t know how people do this, I don’t know where to start on opening up to knowing things about the army. I hate guns, I have strong opinions on them, but he has a strong interest in them and it makes me uncomfortable. 

Is it worth it to try to change my mindset for him and this relationship? I want it to be but I don’t want to lose my own morals. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this? How did you manage to stay together through the absence? Was it all worth it and after their time served is it easier?

,Army,"Greetings Reddit,

I am set to deploy for basic training on January 2nd, having chosen the 94R (Survivability and Equipment Repairer) MOS and entering as an E4. The reason I'm reaching out to Reddit is that I've been grappling with serious doubts about my decision to join the Army. To provide some context, I went through a mid-life crisis, left my hometown, and moved up north with my mother to pursue this path. In doing so, I left everything behind with no intention of returning. My impulsive nature led me to make this significant decision in a relatively short timeframe, deciding to enlist in September. Now, with about a week left before I ship out, I'm second-guessing my choice. It feels like I rushed into this commitment without fully considering the implications of the 4-5-year contract I'm about to sign.

My tendency to overthink things has me questioning whether I should have pursued Officer Candidate School (OCS) instead of enlisting to secure a more stable future. Despite these second thoughts, I feel pressured to join the Army due to the financial constraints and debt I'm currently facing. I regret not taking more time to research my military options before making such a life-changing decision. Unfortunately, that ship has sailed, and I must face the reality of my current situation.

I find myself at a crossroads, torn between my unsatisfying old life, despite having education, skills, and a strong work ethic, and the potential for a steady income and success with the Army. Fearful of making the wrong decision that will impact years of my life, I feel a sense of urgency to choose a path quickly.

For clarity, I have a 4-year-old son whose mother supports my decision to join the Army. We had a 50/50 agreement for our son's custody before I left, aiming to ensure his access to both parents despite our separation. The stark reality of the Army's distance from my son has recently hit me, leading to feelings of depression.

Despite feeling lost, I believe pursuing the Army is my only choice at this point to avoid drowning in debt. It's a disconcerting sensation, as it seems like I'm joining the military for reasons different from my initial expectations.

I'm open to answering any questions about my situation and would appreciate any feedback, whether positive or negative.",t2_q1gtn6qsq,False,,0,False,Seeking Guidance and Feedback on Military Decision and Concerns,[],r/army,False,7.0,,0,,,False,t3_18q3vf0,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1703451944.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"I am enlisted currently, but I am just curious what the process to go from enlisted to officer is just for future reference if I decide to go that route later in my career. When I first enlisted my recruiter mentioned the green to gold program but my research into that has said that it is only open to Active-Duty people. I am currently in my last year of my bachelor's degree so I believe that may rule out ROTC, and it isn't even offered at my college anyways.

,Army,"I've been thinking about how the Army treats driving a lot recently. My specific base has \~60% of the soldiers in the unit living in barracks 30-45 minutes away from their place of duty. That leads to a lot of ride sharing, which has consistently led to soldiers having give rides in difficult circumstances. I'm all for ride sharing but it shouldn't be a requirement. I actually had to drive my NCO to work for a solid 6 months and never received any compensation, but moving on. 

There's a non-zero amount of soldiers here who can't legally drive because they don't have a US state driver's license required to apply for the host nation equivalent. Most people gloss over the word ""state"" when dealing with that, but that seems like a huge issue to me. It baffles me that soldiers are required to interface with the DMV/BMV from their home state just to certify that they are a competent driver.

A significant amount of people join the military for the express purpose of distancing themselves from their home, and that has an overlap with soldiers who, for whatever reason, don't have a license when they join or have a license that expires after they join. There are a lot of extrapolations to be made from this circumstance, but the biggest one in my mind is that soldiers who either can't or don't want to go back to their home state might not be able to maintain their driving privileges. 

Many DMV/BMV's have restrictions on how much they allow you to do remotely. Not to mention, they are generally extremely strict and may require multiple appointments to resolve an issue. This is a fundamental conflict with the military because a huge amount of soldiers don't reside is the same state as their DMV/BMV. In my unit's circumstance, they are stationed a $800-$1500 plane ticket away. Factoring in more considerations like leave, lodging, and transportation, It's a monumental task to undertake with no support from the military.

It seems to me that there is an extremely simple, albeit congress-level, solution to this. The creation of a DOD-wide ""Military driver's license"" would be an increase in quality of life for many soldiers. It could be a bona-fide ID card and simply certify that the holder is a trained and competent operator of motor vehicles. Testing could be performed in the same way they do motorcycle safety classes with a small classroom portion and then a practical test.

I know this issue isn't high visibility like mold or low pay, but I feel it's an important one nonetheless. In the meantime, I'll keep praying my engine doesn't seize up and my tires stay leakless.

I can’t afford anything. I got fired from my job and drained my entire savings just trying to survive. And it’s ironic because I got fired for being suicidal in the first place, and now here I am. Right back to the same spot. This time tho, I know better than to ask for help or admit to anyone that I’m feeling that way. That’s what got me in this hell hole to begin with. 

I’m going to lose my car. I can’t make rent so I guess I’ll move my stuff out and let my roommates find a replacement. I can’t even afford groceries. It feels like I’ve been fighting to keep my head above water for so long and I just can’t keep treading any longer. I just want to stop swimming and drown. 

I can’t get hired within my career anymore because my last job won’t give a good reference. The ARNG wants to separate me because I’m not mentally stable enough. Which, I don’t know anyone that would be “stable” when dealt the hand I’ve been dealt the last two years. I can’t even get a release to go active duty.

,Army,"Hey everyone, recently I’ve been looking and wanting to join the Army as 35T but I’m stuck atm, here’s why.

Mid 2018 I was in highschool (minor) when a group of kids got in trouble, including myself. Long story short, I smoked marijuana for the first and only time. Few days later we all get caught. I had a cartridge battery in my bag (no residue of any sort as far as I can remember) when a police officer discovered it. They sent it to go get “it tested” I didn’t hear anything back from them. I received a misdemeanor for Drug paraphernalia that day. They called my parents to the school, explained the situation and we went home. I was never placed under arrest, never went/faced a judge/ nor did I get my finger prints taken. I did a diversion program that expunges your charge when you’re 18. I completed what was needed and got a letter in the mail when I turned 18 stating my charge has been “expunged” from my record (I know it can still be brought up) After highschool I started working for the Gov and was told I need a clearance. Filled out the SF86 form and listed my accident that happened. They asked questions and was given my clearance that same day. I want to see what the possibility is for me getting a TS/SCI that is required for 35T mos ? Do I have a shot at this ??

,Army,"'Twas the night before Christmas
And high in the sky
A single, lone plane
Through the air did fly

On board a Paratrooper
And pallets of toys
Ready for heavy drop
To good girls and boys

Now Santa stands ready
Only ten minutes more
The jumpmaster says
""Stand in the door!""

Santa Claus jumps out
As the red light turns green
His parachute rigged toys
From the ground can be seen

The toys fall in chimneys
All across the land
Bringing joy and smiles
And a Christmas so grand

The Christmas drop was successful
And Santa PLFs with precision
Because Santa is a Paratrooper
With the 82nd Airborne Division

Happy Holidays!

&gt;After  years of headlines and watchdog reports condemning shoddy living  conditions for service members and families, a consensus appears to be  developing between Army senior leaders, housing executives and even  lawmakers that something drastic must occur to fix the service’s  barracks and family housing for good.  
&gt;  
&gt;Army  Secretary Christine Wormuth has repeatedly called for a “generational  investment” in the service’s housing and barracks stock that goes beyond  the constraints of the regular budgeting process, in which every  investment comes at the cost of another priority.

Ah yes, throw more studies at the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But some critics are concerned that the service might struggle to take  care of its new and repaired buildings even if such an investment were  to occur. The Army systematically underfunded barracks maintenance  during much of the War on Terror era in order to fund other priorities. 

The problem is that the Army (DOD as a whole really) loves to play the ""we can't fix the barracks or family housing because we spent those funds and we can't raid another pot of money"" and then the service either delays or DOES raid the money for the barracks because ""readiness"". 

If the Army is serious about fixing the issue, the money needs to be locked down.  I don't care if some BDE needs to deploy but couldn't manager their funds or if there are weeds on the small arms ranges.  The money to fix the barracks and family housing should ONLY be spent on housing. 

Fixing housing won't solve all the QOL issues but it will fix one of the biggest ones.

&lt;p&gt;If the Army is serious about fixing the issue, the money needs to be locked down.  I don&amp;#39;t care if some BDE needs to deploy but couldn&amp;#39;t manager their funds or if there are weeds on the small arms ranges.  The money to fix the barracks and family housing should ONLY be spent on housing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing housing won&amp;#39;t solve all the QOL issues but it will fix one of the biggest ones.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"So I'm in my late 20s and I'm interested in trying out for Army Special Operations (Rangers or SF). The mission of the Rangers seems more appealing to me than SF. But I hear a lot of people saying if you are enlisting in your late 20s you should do SF and not Rangers.

Does my age make that much of a difference when trying to decide between those two? Like would my age make that much of a difference in Ranger Regiment? Both obviously would be amazing opportunities and are very interesting, but Rangers overall seems more interesting to me personally due to their mission and specializations.

Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks!

I look on IPPSA with the recruiters I’m working with and they see my leave forms. They have someone else’s name and the dates are super weird. The forms said I’m supposed to be in the office on Christmas Day. I’m also only approved for leave up until the 2nd of January. I know the guy who’s leave form is in my IPPSA and he has to go to airborne school so it makes sense. I’m not due to report to my duty station until mid January.

The recruiters I’m working with seem to think I’m all good to report to my duty station some 2 weeks early. That seems odd to me. My buddy who’s a SPC is telling me I should just report in a day early from when my orders are saying to report there.

The forms said I’m supposed to be in the office on Christmas Day. I’m also only approved for leave up until the 2nd of January. I know the guy who’s leave form is in my IPPSA and he has to go to airborne school so it makes sense. I’m not due to report to my duty station until mid January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recruiters I’m working with seem to think I’m all good to report to my duty station some 2 weeks early. That seems odd to me. My buddy who’s a SPC is telling me I should just report in a day early from when my orders are saying to report there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you guys do?&lt;/p&gt;

Nitty Gritty:

I just passed ten years of service in the reserve. I have one deployment in the past and a med board that followed four years later that cleared me to stay in.

I did three years of therapy, talked all the feelings out, and felt a lot better mentally. I submitted a VA claim somewhere in there and received 60% for a generalized stress and anxiety disorder, tinnitus, and shoulder surgery with a LOD. 

Fun Facts: 

I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder a couple of years after my first deployment, hence the med-board. However, they cleared me after my psychologist reassessed me and diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. 

The following year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Again, news to me, I have been in for eight years at this point and am shitting myself on what was going to happen to me. 

I got kicked off a deployment about two weeks ago and was going to leave soon. I was told I might be medically separated or retired since I am at 60% disability and have much time in service.

Question:

Can I be dishonorably or other than honorably discharged for this?

Should I expect to lose my VA disability or retirement benefits?

I am anxious about it since these both occurred in service well into my career, and I planned on doing my 20 years before leaving. Now, I'm about to lose it all when I was planning on deploying and taking pride in my service and growth.

SW: 235lbs
GW: 170-165lbs
Height: 5’5 ft.

I’m here to get advice and do some research. I intend to post this post in the weight loss/fitness community too, but figured I could try to ask here as well.

I am 22 years old. I am graduating this month with a certified diploma, but want to use this new year to get my ass in gear and start a cut to get fit and ready for enlistment. I’ve spoken to the Army and Marine Corps recruiters, and they are encouraging me to do a few workouts with them and even come get weighed in/taped at the end of every month till I meet their standards. Currently I am researching the pros and cons of each branch before making a in stone decision.

Now, until I reach a certain weight, running/rucking isn’t in motion just yet, but calisthenics and weight lifting is. I wanted to see if anyone could give me advice on which workout routine worked for them? I am looking at a Hybrid Split, but I’ve also heard about PPL x Arnold and 5x5.

The hardest part about my commitment is the nutritional side, I want to hit a high protein calorie deficit, but I work a 5am - 3pm labor job M-F. So F-M are my gym days, so does anyone have any advice on meal prep or anything to help hit my goals?

I’m just in need of any advice or tips, so feel free to throw in your workout routines, your diet plans, supplements, hell, even extra stuff I should know before enlistment. Please and thank you.

Reason I'm asking is that my dad, who passed away in 2020, was in the 11th ACR at two very significant times in their history:  During the Cold War in Germany from 1959 - 1963 and in Vietnam from 1966 - 67.  In fact, Dad was recalled to active duty in the Summer of 1966 when I was 4 years old and we briefly moved to Fort Meade, MD, where the regiment trained up for their deployment.  Then in late Summer they sailed from San Francisco to Vietnam.  Dad was an officer (1LT when he was reactivated and he made Captain while he was in Vietnam.)  I think his last job was Regimental Assistant S3 Air.  

Anyway, when my dad passed away I got a box of ""stuff"" much of which relates to his time with the 11th Cav.  I'm almost 62 and have no kids, and I'd rather give it to a historian than just toss it in the trash.

Prior service Marine coming in as a 35P E5. Shipping to DLI soon and had a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Am I supposed to get my new CAC prior to shipping to DLI?   
My recruiter assumed I just arrive to DLI without one and that sounds off.
2. Will I receive a set of OCP/ASU or am I SOL and required to spend out of pocket?   
I read through older posts saying that uniforms will be issued at AIT, is this the case at DLI?
3. Do I get issued any gear at DLI or is everything issued at AIT?
4. Any DLI/AIT/general tips for a brand new E5/35P with no Army experience?

,Army,"Hello everyone,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I was previously in the army reserve for 6 years. As soon as I switched into active duty, I noticed I was being paid at 0 years TIS instead of 6 years. I immediately went to finance to try to get it fixed and they pointed me to retention. 

I submitted an MMPA packet to retention that corrected my BASD giving me an extra 8-9 months of active duty time, but my PEBD remained the same. Since then, I've been following up with retention every 1-2 months for updates on getting it fixed. Fast forward to now, apparently an MMPA wasn't even what was needed to getting my PEBD (TIS pay) fixed; rather it needed to be my retirement points and a 1506. My brigade retention submitted the 1506 after my battalion retention NCO PCS'd recently, but DFAS pushed it back for an error after 60 days. 

After 30 days of waiting for my brigade retention NCO to resubmit it with the fix, he ended up resubmitting the same 1506 with no changes to DFAS thinking for some reason that it was never submitted in the first place and that the base finance civilian pushed it back to us even though she literally emailed us both with the case number and I called DFAS to check the status on it.

Do you guys think I've given it enough time for retention to fix this issue? I'm going on terminal leave in 4 months and based on my calculations, I'm owed like $18,000 pretax in back pay. I have zero hope for the army to fix my pay once I'm out as a civilian.

Need some help in regulations.
My situation is that I picked up in October, and pinned a week in. Was gonna move out in November because unit was too darn busy to take Permissive TDY and I was In ALC phase 1(I do what them days to do stuff).
November, got DA selected for recruiting as part of that scare while is ALC Phase 1.
Got magic and shoved to the right in March.
Got required MOS training in December with days out of training only myself for my critical section(no time to house hunt.

Got ALC Phase 2 in Jan and get out Feb.
Don't know if after completing recruiting I will be PCSed or not despite not having the time in service and I won't have it(not reenlisting)

Not gonna go through everything to get a place in February to just risk breaking contract  and waste time if I have to move.

Immediate leadership tracking and even CSM cool with it. Been worried about brigade finding out and pushing the issue and with every manner of rank asking me questions.

Can't find anything in post or Army regs that say ""must"" vs ""can"" or ""may"".

I’ll share one: 

Drill Sgt Johnson (fake name) instructs us that he wants each bay to tell him a joke when he comes up for toes on line before lights out. Lit. 

DS Johnson comes into the bay, gets his count and then asks for his joke.

My battle asks “DS Johnson, have you heard the joke about the three midgets?” 

DS Johnson replies “no.”

Perfect. 
My battle starts the joke saying:  

“Ok so there are three midgets all sitting around talking. One realizes, “hey! I have really small hands” and decides that he will get it verified by the Guinness book of world records to see if he has the smallest hands in the world. 

The next midget looks down and says “gee, I think I might have the smallest feet in the world. I’ll go too!”

Finally the third midget looks down and goes “damn. I think I’ve got the smallest dick in the world, I’d better tag along and see if I can get the world record too!” 

So the next day they all walk in to the Guinness book of world records office. 

The first midget walks out after about an hour and a half with a huge grin on his face. “I got it! I have the smallest hands in the world!” He exclaims. 

The second midget comes out about thirty minutes later, smiling ear to ear. He says the same thing “I have the smallest feet in the world!” 

Finally, the third midget comes out of the office shortly after the second. He looks shaken up and really disappointed. His buddies ask “what happened!”

,Army,"You’re having a hard time. Whatever the reason is behind you having a hard time, I’m sorry. Yes you’re strong, yes your independent, yes you got people depending on you, but you need help too. It doesn’t  make you less of a Soldier, it doesn’t mean your weak. It actually means the opposite, you’re reaching out and getting help which can show other service members it’s okay to do so and that’s what leaders do. If your chain of command has an issue with it, fuck them. The only way we’re going to eliminate this negative stigma is by going and getting the help we need then coming back better than ever. It fucking works, so go do it. 

Don’t trust on base BH? That’s fine, go anyways, ask for a referral off base. This has worked in every instance. You’ll have to see the doc on base first to make sure you’re not in immediate danger then they will approve it. The Tricare referral website is simple to use and you can choose a doctor from the directory, call around from those options and find what fits you best with availability, specialty, and gender. 

Toss the booze, the energy drinks, and anything else negative in your life. These attribute to your anxiety and depression significantly. Don’t believe me? Cut it out and hit the gym, it’s okay if you fall a couple times and slip up, get the fuck back up and do it again. See how much better you feel.

Whatever the reason is behind you having a hard time, I’m sorry. Yes you’re strong, yes your independent, yes you got people depending on you, but you need help too. It doesn’t  make you less of a Soldier, it doesn’t mean your weak. It actually means the opposite, you’re reaching out and getting help which can show other service members it’s okay to do so and that’s what leaders do. If your chain of command has an issue with it, fuck them. The only way we’re going to eliminate this negative stigma is by going and getting the help we need then coming back better than ever. It fucking works, so go do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t trust on base BH? That’s fine, go anyways, ask for a referral off base. This has worked in every instance. You’ll have to see the doc on base first to make sure you’re not in immediate danger then they will approve it. The Tricare referral website is simple to use and you can choose a doctor from the directory, call around from those options and find what fits you best with availability, specialty, and gender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toss the booze, the energy drinks, and anything else negative in your life. These attribute to your anxiety and depression significantly. Don’t believe me? Cut it out and hit the gym, it’s okay if you fall a couple times and slip up, get the fuck back up and do it again. See how much better you feel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be a better Soldier, leader, spouse, parent, and member of society. &lt;/p&gt;

,Army," 

Hello,

I decided to share my experience and knowledge of REFRAD'n. Know that everyone's experience will be different, in my case I was an O3E getting out at 8 years. Here's what I learned:

THE PROCESS:

1. Receive your last OER and it's been submitted to HQDA/in your iPerms. Only matters if you plan on a DOD job where they'll ask for your OERs


2. 18 months out, you NEED to start SFL-TAP (only requires commander signature, not 2 levels up)


3. Once finished with SFL-TAP, take the CSP portion of the SFL-TAP courses. The CSP class is mandatory to part-take in a CSP which I recommend everyone try to do. 


4. Find a CSP you want to do, (3 letter agencies do have CSPs) it can also be any business/organization as long as it's not your immediate family's and you cannot be paid by the internship. If the CSP is not a known one to the DOD it will take longer, but that doesn't mean you can't do it. It can be anywhere up to 6 months and can only be done during your last 180 days of active duty.


5. Talk to the company. Get the company/organization to soft-select you and start CSP paperwork from the transitions office. You'll need to fill out the nformation, such as what you'll be doing and the layout of the internship. (This step takes 2 weeks for transitions to be approved and 2 weeks for legal review, SO START EARLY)


6. If you can't find a good CSP and still want to take advantage of it, apply for Cameron-Brooks, Alliance Careers, or any JMO recruiting organization. They have the fastest most streamlined processes for CSPs, it's all online and mostly helps you generally transition into the civilian workforce. Know that most of these are trying to place you in a corporate business since they receive money/benefits for finding and placing you. 


7. Simultaneously, as you're looking for a CSP and started the CSP paperwork, collect and submit your REFRAD packet. It will need Commander, BC, BDE signature and endorsement. Stay up to date on your CoC because they will ""lose"" and ""hold"" your paperwork to make you reconsider. (This step took me 8 months due to upper-level commanders waiting for CoCs to push it to the next guy, which made me restart from scratch as the signatures all had to be redone with new names).


8. REFRAD signed by BDE CMDR is only the first step, it needs to go to HQDA and your branch (make sure BDE S1 submits it to HQDA/Branch/Retirement Office) sometimes they'll just give you the packet and you'll assume they submitted it to your retirement office. Everyone has to ""vote"" to let you out and strength/manning, branch manager, board, etc. This process all the way to HQDA takes \~2 Months, so stay on top of where your packet is sitting. (Note: IPSS-A was not out while I did my REFRAD so it could be quicker now). (In my case specifically due to the ""brown-out"" my packet sat at branch/HQDA for about 5 months, which because I was now considered excess strength due to declining CCC, I was deployed downrange and didn't find out my REFRAD was accepted till 1/2 through the deployment).


9. While this is going on, GO TO THE DOCTOR. Whatever you plan on claiming with the VA must be on your military record. If you don't plan on claiming anything or feel/get told you're taking advantage, all I can say is the VA medical process is 100% your choice. No one can force you either way. The way I see it, it's your personal choice to decide whether you feel you were injured enough to seek medical treatment and it is to be documented that it occurred while serving. The VA needs 3 things for a successful claim. A. See doctor and issue recorded. B. Full Diagnosis. C. Treatment (must be ongoing/more than once). I recommend you read 38 CFR for whatever conditions you plan on claiming and it'll tell you the exact criteria needed for what percentages. Even if your issue doesn't rate any percentage, a 0% service-connected is still a VA disability (This can always be appealed as well), but make sure if you want to submit a claim to capture everything you want documented as service-connected. You only have 1 year after separating for the issue to be assumed service-connected, afterwards, it's extremely difficult to justify the issue and will need either Buddy Letters, DBQ, Sworn Statements, etc. 


10. Once your REFRAD gets back from HQDA and is fully approved, start your leave form, your CSP needs to be fully approved by this point too. 

11. Set your CSP for your last 6 months in the army. If you have leave, take it prior to the start of your CSP (don't sell it, you're losing money (BAH/BAS/COLA) if you do and if you go GS it counts against leave you want to sell as a government civilian in the future as there is a cap).

Example of the best case: 60 days of leave and 6-month CSP, need clearing papers 10 days prior to leave start date, clear the army, take leave, start CSP. Complete.

Example if not full 6 month CSP: 10 days clear army, 4-month CSP, 2 months of leave (can start a job during leave to get double pay). But know that if you have a 4-month CSP and say 65 days of leave, you won't be able to take those 5 days and will have to sell it. 


12. \*\*SUBMIT!!!\*\* Fully submit your VA claim at minimum 3 months from your separation date. If you miss it by even a day, you're going to wait a year+ to get your ratings and another 6+ months to get a paycheck. (You will be back paid assuming you receive a rating above 0%).


13. You need to plan this all out in order to know what day you're setting as your last day in the Army. Once you set it, it's a pain in the ass to change it and usually takes 2 months to change. So KNOW YOUR DATE after calculating CSP, Leave (include leave accrued during CSP and while on Leave), and clearing times.


14. Congrats, you completed the REFRAD process. 


15. Most important thing to note, no one gives a shit you're getting out. Almost none of your active duty (coworkers/bosses) personnel know the process of getting out because they haven't done it yet. They don't know what they're talking about and they most definitely don't give a shit about you getting out. Take control of your own process and don't let anyone bully you. Set your medical appointments and go, stop giving a shit if your boss is mad you're gone a lot, or if you receive profiles. The transitioning process is stressful and takes a lot of time/commitment (which is why a lot of my peers just end up staying). So do your due diligence and start planning now.

Notes: 

Once you have a separation date, here are 3 companies to join. Hiring our Heros (they will literally write your resume for you, give you mock interviews, or help you start a business) all for free. American Legion, a $45 entry fee, but if you need help with the VA process, they will assign you a VSO to help you submit your claim. Wounded Warrior Project, can also help submit your VA claim by assigning you a VSO, though it's harder and takes a lot longer for WWP to reply.

The 90 days after active duty Tricare is fake, don't believe it. Tricare removes you as a sponsor immediately, I've tried calling and getting added back in but to no avail. Have a plan for medical care and insurance, especially if you need follow-up appointments for your VA claim. Also if you need medication. (I have been without some of my necessary medications for a while now due to the long process of finding a PCP where I'm at).

AMEX Gold/Platinum, Chase Sapphire Reserve, and other credit cards. They know immediately once you're separated. They have a 3-month grace period for no annual fees so either have a plan to cancel or pay the fees. There's some good article about downgrading your cards as well. (NOTE: If you cancel your cards and you still have redemption points to spend, they will VANISH. Spend all your points prior to cancelation). SCRA for interest rates only applies WHILE ON active duty. If you have a card or student loan that is receiving an SCRA rate locked at 4%, it will go up to whatever the national average is (\~15%) so pay off your cards prior to getting out/student loans.

For the 10 years of federal service for student loan forgiveness, if you switch to a government civilian job (GS) that time will count. If you're a contractor, that time will not count. Have a plan for your TSP as you will need to roll it into something else if you don't plan on going GS. (Can be into a personal retirement fund account, or wherever you get hired at's 401K plan).

If you do want to go GS, buy back your time. Say you did 6 years, you can ""buy back"" that time into your GS pension, which is 100% worth it, but you will need to have money set aside to pay for it. Calculate it prior to transitioning. 

You can sign up for VGLI (similar to SGLI) up to 120 days after separating. I'd say it's a decent price for what you get, but the best part is they will not evaluate you for any medical conditions. So could be worth it depending on your situation. 

Once you separate, if they let you keep your CAC (the way to do this is to make sure you tell DEERs you're still in the IRR for however long you owe still), know that it deactivates in about a week after separation. If you have emails you want to save, do it now. If you get scanned at the gate with said CAC, they will take it. If you try to use the commissary, the card will not work. (If you did the VA steps correctly and received any disability, including 0% but service-connected, you will get a Veterans ID that allows you to use the MWR and Commissary). 

Create your DS Login and DON'T FORGET the password. Once your CAC deactivates the only way to sign into MyPay, MHS Genesis, iPerms, etc is with your DS Login.

LinkedIn has a free premium membership for active duty personnel for 1 year. I recommend using it as well as ZipRecruiter, and Cleared Jobs. That's how I found my current job. Check Silent Profesionals if you had a cool job while in. 

Also, if you are going to receive an ETS award, ask your CoC to do it early. I didn't receive mine till after my separation date and now I have a long process ahead of me to get it added to my DD214 (turning it into a DD215). For all you dirty priors, if you have old DD214s or ERBs, bring them with you when you have your DD214 day. It's the only form the clerks usually allow to input enlisted service data.

Lastly, Good Luck and Congratulations on your Transition! If you are on the fence about getting out, don't let the process deter you. My mentor put it this way, decide and weigh the good days vs the bad days. Once the bad days start to out-weigh the good, it's time to find something that makes you happy. ",t2_8a3dog1x,False,,0,False,REFRAD and Transitioning Trips and Tricks,[],r/army,False,7.0,,0,,,False,t3_18snz6z,False,dark,1.0,,public,7,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,False,self,1703756980.0,,[],{},,True,,1703747868.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to share my experience and knowledge of REFRAD&amp;#39;n. Know that everyone&amp;#39;s experience will be different, in my case I was an O3E getting out at 8 years. Here&amp;#39;s what I learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE PROCESS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receive your last OER and it&amp;#39;s been submitted to HQDA/in your iPerms. Only matters if you plan on a DOD job where they&amp;#39;ll ask for your OERs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;18 months out, you NEED to start SFL-TAP (only requires commander signature, not 2 levels up)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once finished with SFL-TAP, take the CSP portion of the SFL-TAP courses. The CSP class is mandatory to part-take in a CSP which I recommend everyone try to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a CSP you want to do, (3 letter agencies do have CSPs) it can also be any business/organization as long as it&amp;#39;s not your immediate family&amp;#39;s and you cannot be paid by the internship. If the CSP is not a known one to the DOD it will take longer, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you can&amp;#39;t do it. It can be anywhere up to 6 months and can only be done during your last 180 days of active duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to the company. Get the company/organization to soft-select you and start CSP paperwork from the transitions office. You&amp;#39;ll need to fill out the nformation, such as what you&amp;#39;ll be doing and the layout of the internship. (This step takes 2 weeks for transitions to be approved and 2 weeks for legal review, SO START EARLY)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t find a good CSP and still want to take advantage of it, apply for Cameron-Brooks, Alliance Careers, or any JMO recruiting organization. They have the fastest most streamlined processes for CSPs, it&amp;#39;s all online and mostly helps you generally transition into the civilian workforce. Know that most of these are trying to place you in a corporate business since they receive money/benefits for finding and placing you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, as you&amp;#39;re looking for a CSP and started the CSP paperwork, collect and submit your REFRAD packet. It will need Commander, BC, BDE signature and endorsement. Stay up to date on your CoC because they will &amp;quot;lose&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hold&amp;quot; your paperwork to make you reconsider. (This step took me 8 months due to upper-level commanders waiting for CoCs to push it to the next guy, which made me restart from scratch as the signatures all had to be redone with new names).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;REFRAD signed by BDE CMDR is only the first step, it needs to go to HQDA and your branch (make sure BDE S1 submits it to HQDA/Branch/Retirement Office) sometimes they&amp;#39;ll just give you the packet and you&amp;#39;ll assume they submitted it to your retirement office. Everyone has to &amp;quot;vote&amp;quot; to let you out and strength/manning, branch manager, board, etc. This process all the way to HQDA takes ~2 Months, so stay on top of where your packet is sitting. (Note: IPSS-A was not out while I did my REFRAD so it could be quicker now). (In my case specifically due to the &amp;quot;brown-out&amp;quot; my packet sat at branch/HQDA for about 5 months, which because I was now considered excess strength due to declining CCC, I was deployed downrange and didn&amp;#39;t find out my REFRAD was accepted till 1/2 through the deployment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of the best case: 60 days of leave and 6-month CSP, need clearing papers 10 days prior to leave start date, clear the army, take leave, start CSP. Complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;**SUBMIT!!!** Fully submit your VA claim at minimum 3 months from your separation date. If you miss it by even a day, you&amp;#39;re going to wait a year+ to get your ratings and another 6+ months to get a paycheck. (You will be back paid assuming you receive a rating above 0%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

So KNOW YOUR DATE after calculating CSP, Leave (include leave accrued during CSP and while on Leave), and clearing times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congrats, you completed the REFRAD process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,Army,"For OPSEC purposes, these are made up dates.  


I am a reservist deploying June 1 per mobilization orders. I have had Tricare Reserve Select(TRS) for a long time and have paid my premiums through June 1. My unit S1 runs me for early Tricare Prime on March 1 which is when I am put on a manning document. I was not aware about this as on previous long-term ADOS orders, I only got Tricare Prime when the orders started. However due to Tricare cycle, Tricare does not reflect Prime until April 1. Milconnect has a letter on April 1 saying I was no longer eligible for TRS as of March 1. Unfortunately, I don't realize it until May 1 when I checked my Tricare Humana beneficiary portal as I routinely do. I don't check milconnect that often.

Problem is I started out of network physical therapy on March 15 to take care of minor pains and aches. Out of network care is much better than in-network. So when the PT office and Tricare sync up, I am still on TRS. After talking to both my PT office AND Tricare Humana, I am now liable for out of pocket costs for the 15-20 PT visits I had from March 15 to May 1 to both PT and Humana which is like $2k. While I have been paying my copay, the PT claims never processed.

S1 was informed recently and is trying to figure this out. Essentially, my S1 changed me from a PPO to an HMO aka changed my health insurance w/o telling me. I'm asking to put me back on TRS until the deployment starts but I'm told it's not that simple.

,Army,"Hello! Tell me if I am utterly screwed or if I am showing symptoms, please.

Nitty Gritty:

I just passed ten years of service in the reserve. I have one deployment in the past and a med board that followed four years later that cleared me to stay in.

I did three years of therapy, talked all the feelings out, and felt a lot better mentally. I submitted a VA claim somewhere in there and received 60% for a generalized stress and anxiety disorder, tinnitus, and shoulder surgery with a LOD. 

Fun Facts: 

I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder a couple of years after my first deployment, hence the med-board. However, they cleared me after my psychologist reassessed me and diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. 

The following year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Again, news to me, I have been in for eight years at this point and am shitting myself on what was going to happen to me. 

I got kicked off a deployment about two weeks ago and was going to leave soon. I was told I might be medically separated or retired since I am at 60% disability and have much time in service.

Question:

Can I be dishonorably or other than honorably discharged for this?

Should I expect to lose my VA disability or retirement benefits?

I am anxious about it since these both occurred in service well into my career, and I planned on doing my 20 years before leaving. Now, I'm about to lose it all when I was planning on deploying and taking pride in my service and growth. 

The other shitty thing is my lizard brain is saying, ""Well, that stuff was definitely made worse with service, so go refile with VA.""

I’m here to get advice and do some research. I intend to post this post in the weight loss/fitness community too, but figured I could try to ask here as well.

I am 22 years old. I am graduating this month with a certified diploma, but want to use this new year to get my ass in gear and start a cut to get fit and ready for enlistment. I’ve spoken to the Army and Marine Corps recruiters, and they are encouraging me to do a few workouts with them and even come get weighed in/taped at the end of every month till I meet their standards. Currently I am researching the pros and cons of each branch before making a in stone decision.

Now, until I reach a certain weight, running/rucking isn’t in motion just yet, but calisthenics and weight lifting is. I wanted to see if anyone could give me advice on which workout routine worked for them? I am looking at a Hybrid Split, but I’ve also heard about PPL x Arnold and 5x5.

I’m just in need of any advice or tips, so feel free to throw in your workout routines, your diet plans, supplements, hell, even extra stuff I should know before enlistment. Please and thank you.

,Army,"Long time lurker here, figured I'd finally post.

Been a nasty girl since 2019 and it's been a complete waste of time. Am a 1LT and I don't know anything about the Army or my job (35A). The most they've ever tasked me with is figuring out the weather. The couple of times they've asked me to do more, I did a whole bunch of work, just to be told to disregard.Ive just taken up the unofficial job of going to bat for soldiers nobody wants to listen to.

I dropped a CAD packet and it got approved. Am now waiting to get scrolled. I spoke to a Captain who will receive my scroll and cut my orders. She advised she has duty stations in Korea, Hood, and Bliss.

From my time spent lurking, Hood sounds like a mess so if I get to choose, I'll avoid it. Bliss sounds better but not by a whole lot. Korea sounds like the way to go.

The sticking point is promotion boards. If I get in early 2024, I'll be just 4 months or so from O-3. She expressed some hesitation on sending me to Korea with my promotion so close. 

I can guess at why but I don't understand enough about this process to understand it. Why couldn't I just promote in Korea? Why would promoting stateside be an easier process?

She said she could delay my promotion by 18mo but given the pay difference that sounds like a major L.

,Army,"I'm summoning those of you who are *only* **currently active duty** or **retired**. 

This is about a topic of a veteran wanting to go back in, active duty and looking for your outtake.

The reason why I'm seeking opinions only from active duty or retired veterans is because there are too many biased opinions of us veterans when the topic is brought up about *going back into the military*. Yeah, I get it, going back in, is a stupid idea - to you? I get it, ok. But I already heard your reasons, let me hear it from the updated/current sources that knows what the fuck is going on, right now.

So. I'm a veteran. I wanna go back into the military, as an officer. I did four years in the military, enlisted,, infantry (3 combat tours), got out, went to school using my GI bill and got my degree. The main goal prior to me even getting out, was to go to school, get my degree and go back in as an officer. I started contracting overseas as soon as I got out and did my schooling online. Made bank. The whole money chase is over for me, I made great fucking money high six figures but it didn't bring me happiness. Job felt missionless/empty. Along the way, met many veterans talk about VA VA VA VA. Did my VA shit, slightly forgetting the idea of going back in and only claimed minimal stuff. I have 30% disability now with a possible option for a higher rating (if i claim more, I only claimed my knees). I've been out for some time now, about 5 years now going on 6. I'm fit and live an active life style. I am now in a job doing what I got a degree in. This idea of going back in has stuck with me and even working with the military now but the AF, I still can think of myself going back in. (Side note: I can't ask this question to the military I work with right now, AF, because these mf'ers are a different breed. Gauges, beards, get off early, don't police call - just a different fucking bread) and I get it. Times are different now. Whatever, merry christmas, doesn't phase me. I just can't ask this question because the AF lifestyle is fucking different and I'm not looking to join the AF. I already tried :). Fun fact, if you've been out for 5 years, you can't ever enlist. Second fun fact, going officer in the AF is a min 2 year wait. And they are fucking selective on who they choose. I'm not that god damn smart. I wasn't stellar in college, I did enough to get my fucking degree. And they base their selection on additional shit like voulenteer time and other side shit. Gotta pass. Anyway back to my story. The idea of going back in has stuck with me pretty much since getting out. I do like the military lifestyle, I like being on base, I like all aspects of the military. The purpose of my goal here, is because I want a retirement. I've met countless veterans while contracting overseas who were retired, getting their retirement checks, and VA, plus the check for work. I always envied that. I don't want to retire in the US. Thats my point. Sure, VA is nice if you get a high rating but when it comes time for me to retire. I don't wanna HAVE to work if I don't need to. Having 2 guaranteed paychecks, plus if I retire as a civ somewhere, so 3, and when I get to the age for social securtity, thats 4 checks, sure as hell sounds a lot better than just 1 (VA) or 2 (VA) and a (CIV) job and then later SS. Plus the VA never really has anything saying the VA the VA is forever or at least I dont know if it exists, I cant find it, and with the amount of veterans getting out on a daily basis and claiming VA, getting 100%, fuck I don't even know what the system is going to look like in the next 10 years. I would hate to be relying soley on that and then it ends up stopping or some shit. Thats scary. I'm okay with the current changes the military has shifted to. I've been out long enough,, and worked in enough enviorments that Im well adjusted. To be nice. I'm not a hard ass; knife hander, all that shit. But I am about the military - I like the lifestyle, fitness standards of having to PT every fucking day, I like the idea of moving around consistently, while having a job for stability. The hours and all that shit, late nights, duty, doesn't phase me. I'm over it - It's the military. And I get all that shit.

Clearly you see my mind is made up here already, I'm just looking for some non-biased kick back on my *idea here.*

I guess what I'm trying to really ask here is. How do you like the military right now? (And I know everyone's opinion is different or going to be different on this but from the current sources, whats going on now?). Are you regretting staying in right now - why, or did you regret retiring? What do you think about my idea here?

Basically I'm just thinking - and trying to realistically have an apporach or prepation about my plan/idea here of going back in. It's like if you have your boys and they tell you that chick is bad news, but you go through it anyway and later regret it, and wish you would have listened. Like I'm essentially just romanticizing about the idea of going back in, as an officer, to end up, maybe not enjoying being back in for whatever reason. Then regretting why I gave up all these other options that I could have, had.

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I&amp;#39;m seeking opinions only from active duty or retired veterans is because there are too many biased opinions of us veterans when the topic is brought up about &lt;em&gt;going back into the military&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah, I get it, going back in, is a stupid idea - to you? I get it, ok. But I already heard your reasons, let me hear it from the updated/current sources that knows what the fuck is going on, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. I&amp;#39;m a veteran. I wanna go back into the military, as an officer. I did four years in the military, enlisted,, infantry (3 combat tours), got out, went to school using my GI bill and got my degree. The main goal prior to me even getting out, was to go to school, get my degree and go back in as an officer. I started contracting overseas as soon as I got out and did my schooling online. Made bank. The whole money chase is over for me, I made great fucking money high six figures but it didn&amp;#39;t bring me happiness. Job felt missionless/empty. Along the way, met many veterans talk about VA VA VA VA. Did my VA shit, slightly forgetting the idea of going back in and only claimed minimal stuff. I have 30% disability now with a possible option for a higher rating (if i claim more, I only claimed my knees). I&amp;#39;ve been out for some time now, about 5 years now going on 6. I&amp;#39;m fit and live an active life style. I am now in a job doing what I got a degree in. This idea of going back in has stuck with me and even working with the military now but the AF, I still can think of myself going back in. (Side note: I can&amp;#39;t ask this question to the military I work with right now, AF, because these mf&amp;#39;ers are a different breed. Gauges, beards, get off early, don&amp;#39;t police call - just a different fucking bread) and I get it. Times are different now. Whatever, merry christmas, doesn&amp;#39;t phase me. I just can&amp;#39;t ask this question because the AF lifestyle is fucking different and I&amp;#39;m not looking to join the AF. I already tried :). Fun fact, if you&amp;#39;ve been out for 5 years, you can&amp;#39;t ever enlist. Second fun fact, going officer in the AF is a min 2 year wait. And they are fucking selective on who they choose. I&amp;#39;m not that god damn smart. I wasn&amp;#39;t stellar in college, I did enough to get my fucking degree. And they base their selection on additional shit like voulenteer time and other side shit. Gotta pass. Anyway back to my story. The idea of going back in has stuck with me pretty much since getting out. I do like the military lifestyle, I like being on base, I like all aspects of the military. The purpose of my goal here, is because I want a retirement. I&amp;#39;ve met countless veterans while contracting overseas who were retired, getting their retirement checks, and VA, plus the check for work. I always envied that. I don&amp;#39;t want to retire in the US. Thats my point. Sure, VA is nice if you get a high rating but when it comes time for me to retire. I don&amp;#39;t wanna HAVE to work if I don&amp;#39;t need to. Having 2 guaranteed paychecks, plus if I retire as a civ somewhere, so 3, and when I get to the age for social securtity, thats 4 checks, sure as hell sounds a lot better than just 1 (VA) or 2 (VA) and a (CIV) job and then later SS. Plus the VA never really has anything saying the VA the VA is forever or at least I dont know if it exists, I cant find it, and with the amount of veterans getting out on a daily basis and claiming VA, getting 100%, fuck I don&amp;#39;t even know what the system is going to look like in the next 10 years. I would hate to be relying soley on that and then it ends up stopping or some shit. Thats scary. I&amp;#39;m okay with the current changes the military has shifted to. I&amp;#39;ve been out long enough,, and worked in enough enviorments that Im well adjusted. To be nice. I&amp;#39;m not a hard ass; knife hander, all that shit. But I am about the military - I like the lifestyle, fitness standards of having to PT every fucking day, I like the idea of moving around consistently, while having a job for stability. The hours and all that shit, late nights, duty, doesn&amp;#39;t phase me. I&amp;#39;m over it - It&amp;#39;s the military. And I get all that shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly you see my mind is made up here already, I&amp;#39;m just looking for some non-biased kick back on my &lt;em&gt;idea here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I&amp;#39;m trying to really ask here is. How do you like the military right now? (And I know everyone&amp;#39;s opinion is different or going to be different on this but from the current sources, whats going on now?). Are you regretting staying in right now - why, or did you regret retiring? What do you think about my idea here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I&amp;#39;m just thinking - and trying to realistically have an apporach or prepation about my plan/idea here of going back in. It&amp;#39;s like if you have your boys and they tell you that chick is bad news, but you go through it anyway and later regret it, and wish you would have listened. Like I&amp;#39;m essentially just romanticizing about the idea of going back in, as an officer, to end up, maybe not enjoying being back in for whatever reason. Then regretting why I gave up all these other options that I could have, had.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"I have a situation that’s a little bit complicated &amp; my leadership &amp; current retention officer aren’t sure how I should go about it. I enlisted with my husband into the military Nov, 2021. So obviously we are dual military. He’s planning on reenlisting, I am not. We are stationed in Hawaii. Our DEROS is July 2025, but my ETS is Nov 2025. That’s about 4 months of service after the DEROS. I’m currently pregnant &amp; have family in the military as well, stationed here with us. They would become my family care plan once our baby is born, but they PCS Jan 2025, so my family care plan would fall short about 6 months to our DEROS. What I’m needing advice on is whether or not I will be able to separate from the army early due to these circumstances?

I enlisted with my husband into the military Nov, 2021. So obviously we are dual military. He’s planning on reenlisting, I am not. We are stationed in Hawaii. Our DEROS is July 2025, but my ETS is Nov 2025. That’s about 4 months of service after the DEROS. I’m currently pregnant &amp;amp; have family in the military as well, stationed here with us. They would become my family care plan once our baby is born, but they PCS Jan 2025, so my family care plan would fall short about 6 months to our DEROS. What I’m needing advice on is whether or not I will be able to separate from the army early due to these circumstances?

,Army,"Good morning, Team.

Context:

I'm on holiday leave from basic. I caught up with my employer and was given favorable news. I'm in the running for a promotion upon returning from OCS.

I chose to drill out of a unit 3 1/2 hours away in N.C. anticipating I would relocate to that particular area for a career opportunity. I was thinking long-term/big picture.

After being made aware of the prospects, I thought it best to be pragmatic, and drill with a unit closer to my residence in W.V./current employer (whether I get promoted or not). I'm happy with my civilian circumstances.

Question(s):

1. Is it possible to switch units during/immediately after IET?

2. If so, what would be the procedure?

My recruiter recommended I speak with the Reserve liaison at basic assuming the drill sergeants grant my request for an appointment. I figure it wouldn't hurt to ask the group for feedback.

If it doesn't work, I'm more than willing to make the drive without complaint. It wouldn't be the end of the world, but I'd like to explore any possibility of drilling in my home state.

I chose MP as my branch.

Any thoughts would be appreciated. I hope all is well.

For the past few months I have been extremely stressed about my family, personal relationships, my work section, immediate leaderships constantly babysitting with no cause, upcoming overseas PCS that is being stalled for medical reasons (no idea if serious because I have been referred to a specialist, so probably not great news coming in), going to school for a B.S. full time (so can pay for the classes and get out with a degree in time for my ETS), and just random small life annoyances like most recently a car repair among many other things that seem to bother me more and more as of late.

I want to seek help but what is even the point? Talking to someone won’t get me away from the situation I am in and the best part is I have a clearance so I could potentially lose my job and all future employment opportunities.

Im on leave and ended up smoking, no excuse, don't need pity, just honestly need help. My ambition for myself has gone and I feel like now I have no reason to continue my life in the Army anymore.

,Army,"Informational Post for you transitioning folks

For anyone unaware there exists a field in the civilian world called Biomedical Equipment Technician or BMET (there's also a MOS for it that offers some of the best training in the industry so reclassing for it to go reserves or guard is an option as well). You work in a hospital setting repairing and PMCSing medical equipment, everything from hospital bed to MRI machines. You do NOT need a degree to work in this field but having one does make you more marketable. That being said if you are looking to get into a technical field with little to no experience this is a good option.

Firstly there is the college portion. If you choose, you can use your skillbridge to pursue a 2 year degree or certificate as a BMET though the College of Biomedical Equipment Technology. It is completely remote and is done online. Furthermore they will work with hospitals in your area, (or area you plan to relocate to upon ETS) to find you OJT as well, but is not required to complete the course. The President of the college is an Army veteran himself and the school is very much set up to accommodate military service members. That being said, even if you don't purse it as a skillbridge the scheduling works where you could potentially (given you role/MOS) attend the college during your transition window without it being on skillbridge.[https://cbet.edu/programs/](https://cbet.edu/programs/)

Secondly, the company I will be working for, Trimedx, is an independent service provider and has contracts with hospitals all over the US. They also offer a skillbridge internship.

If you have any questions about the field, the college, Trimedx, or even other companies, please feel free to reach out and DM me any questions you might have.

,Army,"I need help and advice about a serious situation my brother is in. I will try to provide the least information because I am afraid for his safety. He enlisted a few years ago and now lives overseas. He married another soldier not a year ago. None of his relatives know much about this person nor have met them in person.

He's being a victim of narcissistic abuse and it has become physical against him. His life has already been in danger. I convinced him to talk to his superiors which he did, but I have strong suspicion this may have backfired in the way that his abuser may have convinced him to get back together and take the fall for any reports he made. I believe even his career may be in danger. 

He's normally very communicative which drastically changed after the last violent event against him by his partner. I also have strong reasons to believe his phone is being monitored by his partner. I know for a fact that there has been times in which his social media posts and even text message replies have been done by his partner and not him. I am certain that since the last violent event against him occurred, his communication with his family is being monitored.

He's a sweet, kind person and unfortunately, this might make him the perfect person to be the victim of this. I not only fear for him facing consequences that do not belong to him, but also for his life and safety.   


What should I do? Should I call someone (his superiors or FAP)  to tell them what I know? Would that do any good? How can I make sure he's safe and that he has a support system that would understand narcissistic abuse and work with men who go through it? I will appreciate any advice and knowledge.

,Army,"We met at the beginning of June, and have been talking every day since. He's in the US, and I'm in the UK. He's also a sergeant in the military, so he's busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven't phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I'm too anxious to, but he's said that he'd find the time and we could whenever I'm ready. But we've sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven't made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.

But I don't know whether that's going to be possible now.

Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn't feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he's 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn't respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he'd been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn't be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn't have a right to know as we weren't officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.

Everything was fine for a while.

But then he didn't respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he'd had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He's had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I'm aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven't heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He's just completely disappeared on me, and I'm absolutely terrified.

I don't have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I'd never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn't big on social media), so there's no way I can ""stalk"" him to somehow find their details either. I've tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there's nothing.

He's a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn't lie about any of this. I really don't want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.

He&amp;#39;s in the US, and I&amp;#39;m in the UK. He&amp;#39;s also a sergeant in the military, so he&amp;#39;s busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven&amp;#39;t phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I&amp;#39;m too anxious to, but he&amp;#39;s said that he&amp;#39;d find the time and we could whenever I&amp;#39;m ready. But we&amp;#39;ve sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven&amp;#39;t made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t know whether that&amp;#39;s going to be possible now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn&amp;#39;t feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he&amp;#39;s 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn&amp;#39;t respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he&amp;#39;d been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn&amp;#39;t have a right to know as we weren&amp;#39;t officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything was fine for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then he didn&amp;#39;t respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he&amp;#39;d had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He&amp;#39;s had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I&amp;#39;m aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven&amp;#39;t heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He&amp;#39;s just completely disappeared on me, and I&amp;#39;m absolutely terrified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I&amp;#39;d never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn&amp;#39;t big on social media), so there&amp;#39;s no way I can &amp;quot;stalk&amp;quot; him to somehow find their details either. I&amp;#39;ve tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there&amp;#39;s nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn&amp;#39;t lie about any of this. I really don&amp;#39;t want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s been in there way too long for a heart attack, he should&amp;#39;ve been out by now. I have no idea what to do and I feel like I can&amp;#39;t cope, I need him back.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"Informational Post for you transitioning folks

For anyone unaware there exists a field in the civilian world called Biomedical Equipment Technician or BMET (there's also a MOS for it that offers some of the best training in the industry so reclassing for it to go reserves or guard is an option as well). You work in a hospital setting repairing and PMCSing medical equipment, everything from hospital bed to MRI machines. You do NOT need a degree to work in this field but having one does make you more marketable. That being said if you are looking to get into a technical field with little to no experience this is a good option.

Firstly there is the college portion. If you choose, you can use your skillbridge to pursue a 2 year degree or certificate as a BMET though the College of Biomedical Equipment Technology. It is completely remote and is done online. Furthermore they will work with hospitals in your area, (or area you plan to relocate to upon ETS) to find you OJT as well, but is not required to complete the course. The President of the college is an Army veteran himself and the school is very much set up to accommodate military service members. That being said, even if you don't purse it as a skillbridge the scheduling works where you could potentially (given you role/MOS) attend the college during your transition window without it being on skillbridge.[https://cbet.edu/programs/](https://cbet.edu/programs/)

Secondly, the company I will be working for, Trimedx, is an independent service provider and has contracts with hospitals all over the US. They also offer a skillbridge internship.

If you have any questions about the field, the college, Trimedx, or even other companies, please feel free to reach out and DM me any questions you might have.

,Army,"I need help and advice about a serious situation my brother is in. I will try to provide the least information because I am afraid for his safety. He enlisted a few years ago and now lives overseas. He married another soldier not a year ago. None of his relatives know much about this person nor have met them in person.

He's being a victim of narcissistic abuse and it has become physical against him. His life has already been in danger. I convinced him to talk to his superiors which he did, but I have strong suspicion this may have backfired in the way that his abuser may have convinced him to get back together and take the fall for any reports he made. I believe even his career may be in danger. 

He's normally very communicative which drastically changed after the last violent event against him by his partner. I also have strong reasons to believe his phone is being monitored by his partner. I know for a fact that there has been times in which his social media posts and even text message replies have been done by his partner and not him. I am certain that since the last violent event against him occurred, his communication with his family is being monitored.

He's a sweet, kind person and unfortunately, this might make him the perfect person to be the victim of this. I not only fear for him facing consequences that do not belong to him, but also for his life and safety.   


What should I do? Should I call someone (his superiors or FAP)  to tell them what I know? Would that do any good? How can I make sure he's safe and that he has a support system that would understand narcissistic abuse and work with men who go through it? I will appreciate any advice and knowledge.

,Army,"We met at the beginning of June, and have been talking every day since. He's in the US, and I'm in the UK. He's also a sergeant in the military, so he's busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven't phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I'm too anxious to, but he's said that he'd find the time and we could whenever I'm ready. But we've sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven't made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.

But I don't know whether that's going to be possible now.

Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn't feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he's 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn't respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he'd been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn't be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn't have a right to know as we weren't officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.

Everything was fine for a while.

But then he didn't respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he'd had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He's had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I'm aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven't heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He's just completely disappeared on me, and I'm absolutely terrified.

I don't have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I'd never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn't big on social media), so there's no way I can ""stalk"" him to somehow find their details either. I've tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there's nothing.

He's a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn't lie about any of this. I really don't want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.

I was active duty, ETS'd to the IRR for a short period, and joined a USAR unit in late 2021. My contract time on the DA3540 was for ""3 years.""

Fast-forward to now and I've filed a PAR and discussed the issue with my units retention NCO, but our RPAC office hasn't kept me updated on the process, and I had to push just for them to say they only partially had my paperwork and needed ""enlistment forms, like your original DD-4.""

,Army,"Currently AD 15Y getting medboarded for bilateral wrist issues ( Left wrist ECU subluxation and Right wrist TFCC tear) during the medboard process I was in a car accident and while bracing before impact, the energy transfered through my right hand to my wrist, shoulder blade and neck. My usability of my right wrist and hand has now worsened. PEBLO has ""OKed"" me for surgery on the left as it is my dominant hand and on the waitlist pending updated mri of my right wrist to see if further damage is present. 

My question is should hold off the surgery until I get out through the VA? I will eventually need surgery on both wrists. My mum used to work for the VA hospital and knows the horror stories of veterans waiting for care. I've heard improvements have been done through the news but I am sure going through this community would give me better insight.

Also, my plan is to get out medically from army and go back to school via Gi bill and get my 2nd bachelors in advertising. I was originally going to work on helicopters components in line with my MOS, but considering my wrist issues I feel it would be safer to return to my creative nature.

Potential options I am weighing:

° Get out no surgery, get care through VA eventually.
° Get surgery on left, get out, get care through VA eventually for right wrist.
° Get surgery on both wrists, get out with lower VA percentage or possibly found fit for duty.

Please let me know your experiences and advice.

,Army,"How long did your conditional release take?

So a little back story. I finished my active duty contract in February of 2022 and rolled into the reserves. So I’ve been in the reserves since February of 2022. I signed a 4 year contract so it ends in 2026. A few months in, I realized i made a mistake. The reserves is ass. But I kept trucking on. I’ve been struggling alot financially, and mentally. I was gonna wait until the end of the contract to go back active but i dont want to wait that long so I am about to start the process of a conditional release. I know it can take awhile but if anyone has experienced it, how long did yours take? Any advice you can give me? Also if you got a bonus, did you pay it back? And if you’re married to an AD soldier, can you be at the same duty station or does the big army send you wherever once active again?

Are they lonelier than normal? 80-90% go to see family so I'm not sure that's it. Do they not want to see family? Don't like their hometown? Are they out of whack with a different routine or lost without a routine?

I'm just trying to pinpoint what it is about this time of year that makes people extra depressed and/or suicidal. 

To be honest I'm just trying to figure it out for myself at the moment and see why I'm struggling so much these past couple of months. This week it's gotten worse and of course I'm away from my duty location. I may have to use some resources that I'd rather not use. I'm really trying to just make it through the week.

,Army,"Hey y’all, using a burner coz people I know follow my other acc. I’m enlisting in the army sometime in the coming weeks but I’m having second thoughts due to the current political state of the US. I’ve always dreamed of being in the armed forces, but I don’t want to risk being in the military if someone who literally committed treason gets elected. Does the president really have that much of an effect on people in the military? I know it’s kind of a stupid question but I’m genuinely curious.

,Army,"I’ve never posted on Reddit before, so I hope it’s ok I ask for some lenience. I’ve been with my boyfriend for two years, and I’ve never been more in love with a person. I am 19, he is 20, and I know I’m young and naive, but I can’t imagine a future without him. I’ve known since meeting him he’s wanted to join the army. It’s always been a hard subject to talk about, as I never supported it. I have strong negative opinions about the army (I’m trying to learn more, as I want to be more comfortable when he speaks about it) and he also knows this. For a long time we’d procrastinate and avoid talking about the army because I didn’t wanna hear it. 

About a year ago he dropped out of college because he just figured he couldn’t do it. He had a good job, and it wasn’t like he had no where to go. He has a loving family, a friend group, a good job, a girlfriend. But I know he’s always wanted to do this. I know it’s something bigger than me, and it wasn’t fair of me to try to convince him otherwise, to just be an EMT or a cop, anything but leaving me for the army. I couldn’t stand the thought. But he went to the recruiters and after a lot of back and forth papers on medical issues he finally was accepted. He only had ten days before leaving. And two days before he left, he told me he signed for six years instead of four, though he had previously told me four. It broke my heart. In BCT he sent me letters, telling me how much he loved me. I never responded, it was too painful. I’d write drafts but never send them. 

When he got to AIT he called, and we talked for hours, FaceTiming everyday in his personal time. It felt good. Having him home for the holidays feels intoxicating, I’ve missed him so much and every second I’m around him I feel high off of him. But I know he is leaving again soon. I don’t know how people do this, I don’t know where to start on opening up to knowing things about the army. I hate guns, I have strong opinions on them, but he has a strong interest in them and it makes me uncomfortable. 

Is it worth it to try to change my mindset for him and this relationship? I want it to be but I don’t want to lose my own morals. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this? How did you manage to stay together through the absence? Was it all worth it and after their time served is it easier?

,Army,"Greetings Reddit,

I am set to deploy for basic training on January 2nd, having chosen the 94R (Survivability and Equipment Repairer) MOS and entering as an E4. The reason I'm reaching out to Reddit is that I've been grappling with serious doubts about my decision to join the Army. To provide some context, I went through a mid-life crisis, left my hometown, and moved up north with my mother to pursue this path. In doing so, I left everything behind with no intention of returning. My impulsive nature led me to make this significant decision in a relatively short timeframe, deciding to enlist in September. Now, with about a week left before I ship out, I'm second-guessing my choice. It feels like I rushed into this commitment without fully considering the implications of the 4-5-year contract I'm about to sign.

My tendency to overthink things has me questioning whether I should have pursued Officer Candidate School (OCS) instead of enlisting to secure a more stable future. Despite these second thoughts, I feel pressured to join the Army due to the financial constraints and debt I'm currently facing. I regret not taking more time to research my military options before making such a life-changing decision. Unfortunately, that ship has sailed, and I must face the reality of my current situation.

I find myself at a crossroads, torn between my unsatisfying old life, despite having education, skills, and a strong work ethic, and the potential for a steady income and success with the Army. Fearful of making the wrong decision that will impact years of my life, I feel a sense of urgency to choose a path quickly.

For clarity, I have a 4-year-old son whose mother supports my decision to join the Army. We had a 50/50 agreement for our son's custody before I left, aiming to ensure his access to both parents despite our separation. The stark reality of the Army's distance from my son has recently hit me, leading to feelings of depression.

Despite feeling lost, I believe pursuing the Army is my only choice at this point to avoid drowning in debt. It's a disconcerting sensation, as it seems like I'm joining the military for reasons different from my initial expectations.

I'm open to answering any questions about my situation and would appreciate any feedback, whether positive or negative.",t2_q1gtn6qsq,False,,0,False,Seeking Guidance and Feedback on Military Decision and Concerns,[],r/army,False,7.0,,0,,,False,t3_18q3vf0,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1703451944.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"I am enlisted currently, but I am just curious what the process to go from enlisted to officer is just for future reference if I decide to go that route later in my career. When I first enlisted my recruiter mentioned the green to gold program but my research into that has said that it is only open to Active-Duty people. I am currently in my last year of my bachelor's degree so I believe that may rule out ROTC, and it isn't even offered at my college anyways.

,Army,"I've been thinking about how the Army treats driving a lot recently. My specific base has \~60% of the soldiers in the unit living in barracks 30-45 minutes away from their place of duty. That leads to a lot of ride sharing, which has consistently led to soldiers having give rides in difficult circumstances. I'm all for ride sharing but it shouldn't be a requirement. I actually had to drive my NCO to work for a solid 6 months and never received any compensation, but moving on. 

There's a non-zero amount of soldiers here who can't legally drive because they don't have a US state driver's license required to apply for the host nation equivalent. Most people gloss over the word ""state"" when dealing with that, but that seems like a huge issue to me. It baffles me that soldiers are required to interface with the DMV/BMV from their home state just to certify that they are a competent driver.

A significant amount of people join the military for the express purpose of distancing themselves from their home, and that has an overlap with soldiers who, for whatever reason, don't have a license when they join or have a license that expires after they join. There are a lot of extrapolations to be made from this circumstance, but the biggest one in my mind is that soldiers who either can't or don't want to go back to their home state might not be able to maintain their driving privileges. 

Many DMV/BMV's have restrictions on how much they allow you to do remotely. Not to mention, they are generally extremely strict and may require multiple appointments to resolve an issue. This is a fundamental conflict with the military because a huge amount of soldiers don't reside is the same state as their DMV/BMV. In my unit's circumstance, they are stationed a $800-$1500 plane ticket away. Factoring in more considerations like leave, lodging, and transportation, It's a monumental task to undertake with no support from the military.

It seems to me that there is an extremely simple, albeit congress-level, solution to this. The creation of a DOD-wide ""Military driver's license"" would be an increase in quality of life for many soldiers. It could be a bona-fide ID card and simply certify that the holder is a trained and competent operator of motor vehicles. Testing could be performed in the same way they do motorcycle safety classes with a small classroom portion and then a practical test.

I know this issue isn't high visibility like mold or low pay, but I feel it's an important one nonetheless. In the meantime, I'll keep praying my engine doesn't seize up and my tires stay leakless.

I can’t afford anything. I got fired from my job and drained my entire savings just trying to survive. And it’s ironic because I got fired for being suicidal in the first place, and now here I am. Right back to the same spot. This time tho, I know better than to ask for help or admit to anyone that I’m feeling that way. That’s what got me in this hell hole to begin with. 

I’m going to lose my car. I can’t make rent so I guess I’ll move my stuff out and let my roommates find a replacement. I can’t even afford groceries. It feels like I’ve been fighting to keep my head above water for so long and I just can’t keep treading any longer. I just want to stop swimming and drown. 

I can’t get hired within my career anymore because my last job won’t give a good reference. The ARNG wants to separate me because I’m not mentally stable enough. Which, I don’t know anyone that would be “stable” when dealt the hand I’ve been dealt the last two years. I can’t even get a release to go active duty.

,Army,"Hey everyone, recently I’ve been looking and wanting to join the Army as 35T but I’m stuck atm, here’s why.

Mid 2018 I was in highschool (minor) when a group of kids got in trouble, including myself. Long story short, I smoked marijuana for the first and only time. Few days later we all get caught. I had a cartridge battery in my bag (no residue of any sort as far as I can remember) when a police officer discovered it. They sent it to go get “it tested” I didn’t hear anything back from them. I received a misdemeanor for Drug paraphernalia that day. They called my parents to the school, explained the situation and we went home. I was never placed under arrest, never went/faced a judge/ nor did I get my finger prints taken. I did a diversion program that expunges your charge when you’re 18. I completed what was needed and got a letter in the mail when I turned 18 stating my charge has been “expunged” from my record (I know it can still be brought up) After highschool I started working for the Gov and was told I need a clearance. Filled out the SF86 form and listed my accident that happened. They asked questions and was given my clearance that same day. I want to see what the possibility is for me getting a TS/SCI that is required for 35T mos ? Do I have a shot at this ??

,Army,"'Twas the night before Christmas
And high in the sky
A single, lone plane
Through the air did fly

On board a Paratrooper
And pallets of toys
Ready for heavy drop
To good girls and boys

Now Santa stands ready
Only ten minutes more
The jumpmaster says
""Stand in the door!""

Santa Claus jumps out
As the red light turns green
His parachute rigged toys
From the ground can be seen

The toys fall in chimneys
All across the land
Bringing joy and smiles
And a Christmas so grand

The Christmas drop was successful
And Santa PLFs with precision
Because Santa is a Paratrooper
With the 82nd Airborne Division

Happy Holidays!

&gt;After  years of headlines and watchdog reports condemning shoddy living  conditions for service members and families, a consensus appears to be  developing between Army senior leaders, housing executives and even  lawmakers that something drastic must occur to fix the service’s  barracks and family housing for good.  
&gt;  
&gt;Army  Secretary Christine Wormuth has repeatedly called for a “generational  investment” in the service’s housing and barracks stock that goes beyond  the constraints of the regular budgeting process, in which every  investment comes at the cost of another priority.

Ah yes, throw more studies at the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But some critics are concerned that the service might struggle to take  care of its new and repaired buildings even if such an investment were  to occur. The Army systematically underfunded barracks maintenance  during much of the War on Terror era in order to fund other priorities. 

The problem is that the Army (DOD as a whole really) loves to play the ""we can't fix the barracks or family housing because we spent those funds and we can't raid another pot of money"" and then the service either delays or DOES raid the money for the barracks because ""readiness"". 

If the Army is serious about fixing the issue, the money needs to be locked down.  I don't care if some BDE needs to deploy but couldn't manager their funds or if there are weeds on the small arms ranges.  The money to fix the barracks and family housing should ONLY be spent on housing. 

Fixing housing won't solve all the QOL issues but it will fix one of the biggest ones.

&lt;p&gt;If the Army is serious about fixing the issue, the money needs to be locked down.  I don&amp;#39;t care if some BDE needs to deploy but couldn&amp;#39;t manager their funds or if there are weeds on the small arms ranges.  The money to fix the barracks and family housing should ONLY be spent on housing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing housing won&amp;#39;t solve all the QOL issues but it will fix one of the biggest ones.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"So I'm in my late 20s and I'm interested in trying out for Army Special Operations (Rangers or SF). The mission of the Rangers seems more appealing to me than SF. But I hear a lot of people saying if you are enlisting in your late 20s you should do SF and not Rangers.

Does my age make that much of a difference when trying to decide between those two? Like would my age make that much of a difference in Ranger Regiment? Both obviously would be amazing opportunities and are very interesting, but Rangers overall seems more interesting to me personally due to their mission and specializations.

Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks!

I look on IPPSA with the recruiters I’m working with and they see my leave forms. They have someone else’s name and the dates are super weird. The forms said I’m supposed to be in the office on Christmas Day. I’m also only approved for leave up until the 2nd of January. I know the guy who’s leave form is in my IPPSA and he has to go to airborne school so it makes sense. I’m not due to report to my duty station until mid January.

The recruiters I’m working with seem to think I’m all good to report to my duty station some 2 weeks early. That seems odd to me. My buddy who’s a SPC is telling me I should just report in a day early from when my orders are saying to report there.

The forms said I’m supposed to be in the office on Christmas Day. I’m also only approved for leave up until the 2nd of January. I know the guy who’s leave form is in my IPPSA and he has to go to airborne school so it makes sense. I’m not due to report to my duty station until mid January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recruiters I’m working with seem to think I’m all good to report to my duty station some 2 weeks early. That seems odd to me. My buddy who’s a SPC is telling me I should just report in a day early from when my orders are saying to report there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you guys do?&lt;/p&gt;

Nitty Gritty:

I just passed ten years of service in the reserve. I have one deployment in the past and a med board that followed four years later that cleared me to stay in.

I did three years of therapy, talked all the feelings out, and felt a lot better mentally. I submitted a VA claim somewhere in there and received 60% for a generalized stress and anxiety disorder, tinnitus, and shoulder surgery with a LOD. 

Fun Facts: 

I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder a couple of years after my first deployment, hence the med-board. However, they cleared me after my psychologist reassessed me and diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. 

The following year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Again, news to me, I have been in for eight years at this point and am shitting myself on what was going to happen to me. 

I got kicked off a deployment about two weeks ago and was going to leave soon. I was told I might be medically separated or retired since I am at 60% disability and have much time in service.

Question:

Can I be dishonorably or other than honorably discharged for this?

Should I expect to lose my VA disability or retirement benefits?

I am anxious about it since these both occurred in service well into my career, and I planned on doing my 20 years before leaving. Now, I'm about to lose it all when I was planning on deploying and taking pride in my service and growth.

SW: 235lbs
GW: 170-165lbs
Height: 5’5 ft.

I’m here to get advice and do some research. I intend to post this post in the weight loss/fitness community too, but figured I could try to ask here as well.

I am 22 years old. I am graduating this month with a certified diploma, but want to use this new year to get my ass in gear and start a cut to get fit and ready for enlistment. I’ve spoken to the Army and Marine Corps recruiters, and they are encouraging me to do a few workouts with them and even come get weighed in/taped at the end of every month till I meet their standards. Currently I am researching the pros and cons of each branch before making a in stone decision.

Now, until I reach a certain weight, running/rucking isn’t in motion just yet, but calisthenics and weight lifting is. I wanted to see if anyone could give me advice on which workout routine worked for them? I am looking at a Hybrid Split, but I’ve also heard about PPL x Arnold and 5x5.

The hardest part about my commitment is the nutritional side, I want to hit a high protein calorie deficit, but I work a 5am - 3pm labor job M-F. So F-M are my gym days, so does anyone have any advice on meal prep or anything to help hit my goals?

I’m just in need of any advice or tips, so feel free to throw in your workout routines, your diet plans, supplements, hell, even extra stuff I should know before enlistment. Please and thank you.

Reason I'm asking is that my dad, who passed away in 2020, was in the 11th ACR at two very significant times in their history:  During the Cold War in Germany from 1959 - 1963 and in Vietnam from 1966 - 67.  In fact, Dad was recalled to active duty in the Summer of 1966 when I was 4 years old and we briefly moved to Fort Meade, MD, where the regiment trained up for their deployment.  Then in late Summer they sailed from San Francisco to Vietnam.  Dad was an officer (1LT when he was reactivated and he made Captain while he was in Vietnam.)  I think his last job was Regimental Assistant S3 Air.  

Anyway, when my dad passed away I got a box of ""stuff"" much of which relates to his time with the 11th Cav.  I'm almost 62 and have no kids, and I'd rather give it to a historian than just toss it in the trash.

Prior service Marine coming in as a 35P E5. Shipping to DLI soon and had a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Am I supposed to get my new CAC prior to shipping to DLI?   
My recruiter assumed I just arrive to DLI without one and that sounds off.
2. Will I receive a set of OCP/ASU or am I SOL and required to spend out of pocket?   
I read through older posts saying that uniforms will be issued at AIT, is this the case at DLI?
3. Do I get issued any gear at DLI or is everything issued at AIT?
4. Any DLI/AIT/general tips for a brand new E5/35P with no Army experience?

,Army,"Hello everyone,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I was previously in the army reserve for 6 years. As soon as I switched into active duty, I noticed I was being paid at 0 years TIS instead of 6 years. I immediately went to finance to try to get it fixed and they pointed me to retention. 

I submitted an MMPA packet to retention that corrected my BASD giving me an extra 8-9 months of active duty time, but my PEBD remained the same. Since then, I've been following up with retention every 1-2 months for updates on getting it fixed. Fast forward to now, apparently an MMPA wasn't even what was needed to getting my PEBD (TIS pay) fixed; rather it needed to be my retirement points and a 1506. My brigade retention submitted the 1506 after my battalion retention NCO PCS'd recently, but DFAS pushed it back for an error after 60 days. 

After 30 days of waiting for my brigade retention NCO to resubmit it with the fix, he ended up resubmitting the same 1506 with no changes to DFAS thinking for some reason that it was never submitted in the first place and that the base finance civilian pushed it back to us even though she literally emailed us both with the case number and I called DFAS to check the status on it.

Do you guys think I've given it enough time for retention to fix this issue? I'm going on terminal leave in 4 months and based on my calculations, I'm owed like $18,000 pretax in back pay. I have zero hope for the army to fix my pay once I'm out as a civilian.

Need some help in regulations.
My situation is that I picked up in October, and pinned a week in. Was gonna move out in November because unit was too darn busy to take Permissive TDY and I was In ALC phase 1(I do what them days to do stuff).
November, got DA selected for recruiting as part of that scare while is ALC Phase 1.
Got magic and shoved to the right in March.
Got required MOS training in December with days out of training only myself for my critical section(no time to house hunt.

Got ALC Phase 2 in Jan and get out Feb.
Don't know if after completing recruiting I will be PCSed or not despite not having the time in service and I won't have it(not reenlisting)

Not gonna go through everything to get a place in February to just risk breaking contract  and waste time if I have to move.

Immediate leadership tracking and even CSM cool with it. Been worried about brigade finding out and pushing the issue and with every manner of rank asking me questions.

Can't find anything in post or Army regs that say ""must"" vs ""can"" or ""may"".

I’ll share one: 

Drill Sgt Johnson (fake name) instructs us that he wants each bay to tell him a joke when he comes up for toes on line before lights out. Lit. 

DS Johnson comes into the bay, gets his count and then asks for his joke.

My battle asks “DS Johnson, have you heard the joke about the three midgets?” 

DS Johnson replies “no.”

Perfect. 
My battle starts the joke saying:  

“Ok so there are three midgets all sitting around talking. One realizes, “hey! I have really small hands” and decides that he will get it verified by the Guinness book of world records to see if he has the smallest hands in the world. 

The next midget looks down and says “gee, I think I might have the smallest feet in the world. I’ll go too!”

Finally the third midget looks down and goes “damn. I think I’ve got the smallest dick in the world, I’d better tag along and see if I can get the world record too!” 

So the next day they all walk in to the Guinness book of world records office. 

The first midget walks out after about an hour and a half with a huge grin on his face. “I got it! I have the smallest hands in the world!” He exclaims. 

The second midget comes out about thirty minutes later, smiling ear to ear. He says the same thing “I have the smallest feet in the world!” 

Finally, the third midget comes out of the office shortly after the second. He looks shaken up and really disappointed. His buddies ask “what happened!”

,Army,"You’re having a hard time. Whatever the reason is behind you having a hard time, I’m sorry. Yes you’re strong, yes your independent, yes you got people depending on you, but you need help too. It doesn’t  make you less of a Soldier, it doesn’t mean your weak. It actually means the opposite, you’re reaching out and getting help which can show other service members it’s okay to do so and that’s what leaders do. If your chain of command has an issue with it, fuck them. The only way we’re going to eliminate this negative stigma is by going and getting the help we need then coming back better than ever. It fucking works, so go do it. 

Don’t trust on base BH? That’s fine, go anyways, ask for a referral off base. This has worked in every instance. You’ll have to see the doc on base first to make sure you’re not in immediate danger then they will approve it. The Tricare referral website is simple to use and you can choose a doctor from the directory, call around from those options and find what fits you best with availability, specialty, and gender. 

Toss the booze, the energy drinks, and anything else negative in your life. These attribute to your anxiety and depression significantly. Don’t believe me? Cut it out and hit the gym, it’s okay if you fall a couple times and slip up, get the fuck back up and do it again. See how much better you feel.

Whatever the reason is behind you having a hard time, I’m sorry. Yes you’re strong, yes your independent, yes you got people depending on you, but you need help too. It doesn’t  make you less of a Soldier, it doesn’t mean your weak. It actually means the opposite, you’re reaching out and getting help which can show other service members it’s okay to do so and that’s what leaders do. If your chain of command has an issue with it, fuck them. The only way we’re going to eliminate this negative stigma is by going and getting the help we need then coming back better than ever. It fucking works, so go do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t trust on base BH? That’s fine, go anyways, ask for a referral off base. This has worked in every instance. You’ll have to see the doc on base first to make sure you’re not in immediate danger then they will approve it. The Tricare referral website is simple to use and you can choose a doctor from the directory, call around from those options and find what fits you best with availability, specialty, and gender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toss the booze, the energy drinks, and anything else negative in your life. These attribute to your anxiety and depression significantly. Don’t believe me? Cut it out and hit the gym, it’s okay if you fall a couple times and slip up, get the fuck back up and do it again. See how much better you feel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be a better Soldier, leader, spouse, parent, and member of society. &lt;/p&gt;

From my research apparently Article 15s if filed for the reason you were chaptered out stay on your permanent record, but I'm not sure how accurate this is or the Army was just lazy and didn't remove it. 

Article 15s don't count as actual convictions and I never talked to my commander about the time when I was arrested since he already decided my platoon sergeant was at fault and removed him from our platoon. He didn't actually say that but he was removed from our platoon that following Monday. So you really don't need to say anything.
